"So I considered myself a master in the art of being alone. I have been truly alone for 3 years. I actually got so used to being alone I had no problems with it. I was proud of myself and my brain. I could mention hundreds of the benefits of being alone and I overall just did what I want.However, recently I was playing a video game and someone messaged me to talk about something that happened in the game we played. We ended up playing with each other and talking alot together, overall it was a fun timeBiggest mistake I ever made. The person no longer has any interest in talking with me anymore or being a friend after a month and a half. Which truly depresses me and I wish it did not. That was one of the reasons I liked being alone right there.And I now crave not being alone, even though I should be for many reasons, like my mental well being. Dammit. Have to go thru mastering it all over again. I made the mistake of talking to someone and getting close to them after mastering being alone",0
"i do not think I am suicidal. but i wish i was dead. i do not have the strength tho. and i know i will not be able to do it. I am not strong. but i think I am lacking air. I am kinf of suffocating just thinking to myself. i want someone to talk to, just anything. i just want to feel some presence somebody please",1
"This past year and a half have been absolutely terrible for me. I went into college with hope and excitement to finally start my life, only to be kept in my dorm room the entire time and have almost no college experience. Last fall I became depressed and my grades dropped dramatically, but over the winter I got back into school and really brought my grades up. Only to hear on the week of finals that my brother in the Navy, who I had not seen for over two years, passed away. This led to me ultimately failing one of my required classes that I failed in the fall. Over this summer, I worked at appealing my scholarship and taking classes to help boost my GPA. But because my family's expected family contribution was slightly too high, I could not receive the scholarship I desperately need to afford school. The school has not given me any aid or support, and my parents cannot take out a loan. I am having a really difficult time coping with this, and I am having thoughts of considering to just end it. I worked so hard and Covid took so much away from me. I am terrified of even trying to start over because I am afraid I will lose something or someone else important to me. Thanks for reading this. Lost everything I worked for, do not see much of a reason to keep going",0
"Our anniversary is the 29th, I want to be done then. I have nothing left here that I want. Breakups suck and I cannot deal with it",1
These recurring dark thoughts and embarrassing memories are preventing me from moving forward. I know its limiting my capabilities. It slows me down each time its goes and come back eventually. I do not know for how long i will be able to fight and convince myself that i am not getting mad. It makes me question each and every decision i have ever made in my life. This needs to stop. Crippling depression,0
"I do not know really what say other than I am alone and all I can think about is opening my wrists. I do not want to for the sake of my partner and parents but it is all I can think about, and while before the thought of my loved ones grief has stopped me short. But now it feels like I have put so much pressure on them for so long that they do not even realise how tired of me they are. I think the first few weeks might be hard for them, but I think they will bounce back quicker than they think. I cannot go though another year of this incessant and seemingly sourceless pain. Not confident in my ability to hold in.",1
we are online friends so i cannot know for certain but either they died or passed out from what they were trying and I have been trying to distract myself via videos and stuff but it is still lingering on in my head i do not want to lose them and the worse part is that i have not even fully processed this yet and I am still crying i just hope they are alive I am doing my own method rn but it will take over a week to kill me and that is only if i do it correctly i think one of my friends just killed themself,1
ha i really want to die I am so tired. so long birthday,1
What the title says... assume that meds like Prozac are not an option for me. Has anyone here found success in figuring out how to stop it from happening and ruining their lives... with the power of some other force besides medication? Greatly appreciated if you do not try to convince me to take them. Thanks ya'll. Is there a way to stop ruminating on negative thoughts without meds?,0

"Hello people,I hope everyone who is struggling right now can hold on, even if it means taking it 5 minutes at a time. I will try to keep this short and sweet (bittersweet? is that more appropriate in this context?). I just turned 40 in February. Everyone who I have discussed age with assures me ""age is just a number"". But this year feels a little different. I am not suicidal, or in danger of hurting myself or anyone else. I have struggled with depression and some anxiety since I was 18 or so. At times (mainly in my 20's) I was hospitalized, afraid to live, but just as afraid to die. I did recover somewhat, and was able to hold down a job for a few years.These days, I just feel this feeling growing that things will only get harder- that I am 40, and that any chance to make something of myself is behind me. Thank you for reading this. If anyone would like to chime in and share how they feel, I would appreciate it. In Limbo",0
I wish I could go to bed without wanting not to wake up the next day.And I wish I could wake up without wishing I had not woken up The only thing I want is to stop feeling anything,0
"I made a post yesterday about how I was but it was useless. I have already admitted I will not ever have friends and that I will always be alone. I only have my parents, but they will not be forever, so in the future, I will be alone for the rest of my life. I do not even have fun playing videogames anymore, which is the thing I liked the most. I am too much of a coward to kill myself, so I have to keep suffering this life until I die from natural causes.I am tired of everything because I am a piece of trash who no one wants to be with. I always fuck up at everything and lose all my friends or relationships each time I make them. Even a girl cheated on me because I am a shitty person and did not give her enough attention. I cannot stand this anymore... I want everything to end... I am tired of life.",1
How do I keep living like this. I just so desperately want to die. Everything is so hard and I am impossibly overwhelmed constantly. Not even the good things in life cannot make me feel better anymore. Overwhelming urge to die,0
"It never gets better. Day in, day out, the same thoughts surround my headI cannot be alone, my thoughts hate me.I spend my time doing nothing but wishing to vanish from existence.Even as I child, I never wanted to be here. I am not meant for this.I should not be here.I do not belong.People change and grow distant.I cannot save myself, how can they?Too much a coward to end things.I suffer the pain of existence. They all can see it, they cannot help it. It never gets better.I am ready to leave.It never gets better. It never gets better",0
"I really want to get help. I want to confide in someone, but I am too hung up on the thought that they would take on my issues as well. I have always had the mindset that issues are personal; something that you deal with alone. You could tell me that is not true, but I just subconsciously act fake in front of people. I mask my feelings without even noticing that I am doing it. My last therapist did not work for me because I was not even being real with her. I would keep smiling and I would get extremely uncomfortable when opening up, so I would barely say anything about myself or my problems. I only realize this looking back on it now. Hell, we even talked about the weather for a whole session once. I know that its horrible but I do not know how to stop. After a recent breakdown, I realized that I do this with everyone I know. Even with my closest friends and family. So I am basically isolating myself without even trying. How fucking crazy is that? Depression is weird, man. Stuck",0
"Every time I see a high building, I think about it. Every time I see a sharp object, I think about it. Every time I see the street or the highway, I think about it. Every time I see guns in movies or cops, I think about it. Every night I try sleep and cry silently, I think about it. I think about it a lot",1
"I guess i need a place to write this, even if its unseen. That being said, nothing helps. Just straight up, talking to people, food, friends, alcohol, nothing. I feel so selfish for feeling alone because i have a few decent friends but i know due to my lack of real personality traits and crushing depression I cannot even offer that much to anyone. I am just so sad, I am so tired of feeling useless, i cannot live much longer only leaving my bed to go to a job that makes me feel empty. I want a friend so bad who just gets it but i just get abandoned every time Nothing helps lol",0
"If there is one thing I am certain, it is the fact that I am feeling like I am straying further away from social interaction. I have been a complete shut-in since my senior year in high school and now I am already a full-time grinder. I used to force myself to go out and do things alone, like go to a movie, shopping, cafe... yet for the past couple years, I stopped doing so. Basically, my routine is just wake up, go to work (now from home), come back home to sleep. The rest I just spend on computer playing games or watching anime. I do have couple of friends that are still connected, but that is all there is in my circle. I feel like I am just existing for the sakes of the existence itself and not living, because to 'live' you need a purpose and I have got none. I exist but not living",0
"Bare with me guys. I am 22, graduated hs in 2017 and was bulimic in high school. I failed 3+1/2 years of college because of depression that started up my freshman year. I have hidden it from my mom who pays for school w/ the limited $ from parents divorce (because she is extremely reactive so I did not want to tell her &amp; expected the best of me every second because I got good grades in high school). I am just starting over and now she is wondering why I am hiding my grades from her. &amp; I have lied about my grades every since I started failing/was on academic probation in college. I feel like a POS. I do not know what to do. She says if I do not get in a call with a school academic advisor and discuss why I did not get into the state university here WITH HER, she will not be paying for any more school. I am fucking fucked. Long story short, I got my depression handled this last year also but she only knows about the eating disorder. She is NOT the type to be sympathetic about me failing because I had depression, so telling her that is a no. All of the people I know my age have graduated and have degrees w/ a path/future, and I am still here at phase 1, but minus a ton of money. I work for all of my money I have, but my family does not have a lot to spare and my dad does not believe in education &amp; has told me every time I see him that he will never help. Yes, I know I sound ridiculous being sad about wasting money we had for school. Any advice is welcome except for its okay, she will not be mad if you tell her. Depression sucks ass, it directly and indirectly fucks every bit of your life up. Its the reverse Midas touch. Depression in college",0
The response I receive from everyone makes me feel like I am always incorrect or made the wrong choice. I do not know what to do. Feels like every decision I make is incorrect.,0

"I have been postinf here lately. Idk, I think I am just trying to release some pressure. I think I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted. I grew up with zero friends, no friends at all. I felt sad about it for several years... but I feel like this no more. Getting hookups on tinder, making temporary friends, casual chat with other Xbox players and never talking with them again. I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes, it is good to exchange some messages and stuff, but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say, what I do. Not trying to be edgy, trust me. But I think I got to a point where I am dead inside and I do not care if people see it anymore. I have two friends (I met both of them here. Good people, I hope we can still talk, love ya), but I simply do not care about others. I feel no empathy, no remorse, nothing. I know, I should seek help and blah, blah, blah. But the world is just... I fought for my life many years. Tried to seek help, went to therapy, that kind of stuff. But I just cannot see any hope. I go outside and I feel sick. People is just so selfish, ignorant and not a single one of them gives a fuck about others.I worked as a paramedic for a couple of years, donated to charities, tried to be a good person. But the world took me down. I do not know, I think this might be it. This is my life from now on. Not feeling anything. Enjoying my loneliness and feeling empty at the same time. This is it. This is it... I do not know if I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted or just getting used to it. Becoming a cynical person pt.1",0

I am exhausted both mentally and physically and I am starting to feel very lost and alone.with so much stress and sadness I have found that I am getting angry at every small inconvenience. i shut down over the smallest things and cannot seem to get a grip. this is completely out of character for me and i cannot get a handle on it.

"I do not know where else to vent or turn to..I feel like a failed partner, mom, friend, and woman. My man works hours and hours everyday while I sit on my ass..I clean but it will never be good enough to me. I have cats that soil the carpet but they mean the world to me and I know I should get rid of them. I have no money, no job, and I feel like a worthless mooch. I was abused by every man I have loved including my sons father. Now that I have met a man that actually takes care of me I cannot do anything right. I just feel so empty and exhausted and do not know what to do anymore. I am just overwhelmed at this point.. I feel like a failed woman",1
"I spent the last week in a mental hospital for making suicidal threats and gestures. I was mainly just drinking too much and let it get the better of me. They diagnosed me with ""PTSD and Cluster B Personality Disorder"", but I am having a hard time figuring out how. When the nurses processed me I was drunk still and a little frantic and was talking about my abuse and the bad things that have happened to me. Maybe I was being a little too emotional?The thing is, I had 2 separate doctors. I talked to them for a collective maybe 45 minutes each in the past week. And while I spoke to the first one, I was going through Xanax withdrawals. They did not sit me down and ask me a bunch of questions, they just asked a select few and asked me about my medications. I just do not think that that is long enough or enough information to diagnose someone as Cluster B.It would be really upsetting for me to live my life that way. As far as narcissism goes, I am extremely insecure and do not like being around people or toying with them. With histrionic, I have severe anxiety and hate being around people. With antisocial, I do not lack empathy. I truly feel for others and the suffering of those around me makes me upset, and I am not violent or law-breaking.As far as BPD goes, I do not lose my shit. I drink a lot but I have decided to stop doing that. I am really calm and I do not have a fear of abandonment or have intense, unstable relationships. My emotions do not fluctuate and I do not get angry or flip shit on a dime.Is it possible this was a misdiagnosis? Really worrying me. I feel like I need a psych eval, I feel crazy now. How long would it take for a psychologist to diagnose someone with a Cluster B disorder?",0
I want kill myself. I have nothing to live for. My friends all used me. They call the cops instead of taking the time to talk to me and comforting me. I stop checking in on them. They barely check in with me. This guy who I really like used me so I stopped talking to him. I do not think he wants me. No one does. I just want someone to hold me at night.

I fucked up big and I am pathethic and now I am in one of the worst situations i ve ever been in my life can anyone please talk to me or offer me some kind of advice please ? In a very dark place please urgent help,1
"I know the title for this post is strange, but this is truly how I feel, and have been feeling for a while now. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. I also have OCD and autism, so it makes my life a little bit harder than normal. Through all of the struggles and dark times I have, I cannot stop thinking about how much I want someone, anyone, to just hold me in their arms and give me a long hug. It probably would not help in the long term, but it would just be a temporary relief for me with the way I am feeling. For someone to just hug me for a minute would make so much of a difference you would not believe. Like I said, I would not just be permanently healed from this, but it would be a temporary fix at least. Sorry for this weird post, but I just wanted to vent a little. Thanks for reading. I feel like all I need to feel better is just a hug",0

With all the stress during lockdown, losing my job, switching psychologists... let us just say jogging or working out was not exactly at the top of my priorities. But today, I finally did it, and I plan to go again at least 3 more times this week. Guys, remember, every little step counts. Every little bit of thing that may help, at least give it a shot. it is okay if you will fail at first. I wanted to start this again for at least 2 months, and today I finally had enough motivation. It takes a while, but you will get there. Just went jogging for the first time in the years!",0
"I was fully committed to my plan that was going to happen this weekend. First, I was going to say goodbye to my unsuspecting family and go for a walk into the woods, where I was going to gather approximately 20 leaves of *Conium Maculatum* (Poison Hemlock), eat them with a few shots of smuggled vodka or something to that effect, and die within a few hours of respiratory collapse. But now, obviously, I am having second thoughts. I knew that eating hemlock would not be fun and peaceful (but at least its not water hemlock, which kills you way worse), and I even thought that I deserved the pain that it would bring, but now I am scared. Dying from respiratory failure sounds awful. Imagine someone sealing your mouth shut, and then plugging your nostrils. I wanted a way to knock myself out very quickly after eating the leaves so I would not feel anything. Chloroform? Steal horse tranquillisers from the farm on the way to the woods? Seemed too unachievable. And I also had second thoughts because my brain was flooded with things to live for (despite them all being highly romanticised, when in reality I know that my life is shit). And now the stress, shame, anger and everything else that accompanies continuing to live is upon me. I have put off all my work because I thought Id be deadwell now what? I do not exactly have the motivation to catch up with anything, and my family have planned a bunch of outings that I am way too depressed to go on, but I do not want them to know that. Honestly being dead is practical if nothing else. Can we talk about how stressful it is to plan it and not go through with it?",1

After 2 months they just announced ever person in my office is moving location except me. Leaving me alone again. I had made friends. I am sad. I was thinking about self harm again. I hate this and everything about it. Why cannot I find a normal job with normal relationships. Right back to being alone at work.,0
"I am just so tired and alone and never thought Id really be typing on fucking Reddit but I am just all alone. Unless you have time Id probably just leave this post. it will probably be long and Ill probably immediately delete it anyways. Alone is a really weird feeling because how can you be alone while technically surrounded? Well as someone who has a family who has a couple friends I have no one that I can express myself with. I have no one and nothing. I was going years of not telling anyone anything of the about my mental health and just trying and trying to believe what my dad said everything is mental. Even if that is true it does not mean you can control it. They way I think and how I rationalize things has lead me to be so alone. I am sure there is so much more but I feel like it comes from that. From me being too scared to tell anyone anything in fear of them leaving me more alone that I already am. I feel as I am a she will of myself because I am expected to be this person I have spent years and years faking in order to be accepted and liked and wanted and its not me its a form of everything I think I needed to be and I feel as if I am trapped in my own body. Any time I ever express real feelings I end up hurting someone or someone elses feelings. Right now everything in my body is screaming to stop typing and delete this but if I do that then what. I am already here. I apologize for anything and everything I do even before I do it just out of fear of not being liked and wanted and being alone but then I pause and start to think I have never been liked or wanted its only even beeen the fake me.I was with my ex for 3 years and after a lot of research and trying to self heal I have learned the term grooming and learned that was done to me. Out of a sense of love and obligation I allowed myself to basically be stripped of anything good about me or anything I liked or had any interest in in order to be loved and liked to have a family. Long story short I lost myself and I did not talk to any friends or family for 3 years and after getting back to them I feel as if I am always auditioning and I am back to doing anything just to have someone around me but now I know that I am not being liked for me and anytime I ever show anything that is truly me I somehow validate my negative thoughts and rationalize them to be right and I know that is wrong but I am 24/7 screaming in my head fighting with thoughts and screaming at me to stop and begging just for some help and weed barely helps anymore. I do not want to drink but drinking is about the only time now when I do not feel sad. And I am able to literally drown out the thoughts. And i cry everytime I think about anything because I now know how sad Thais all is and the fact that no one knows except i started telling my mom a tiny bit about the negative thoughts and voices and now all I can think about is how me telling her worried her and scared her and I hate myself even more now and I genuinely did not think that was possible. The problem is, that I do not think I am ad guy or anything like I played plenty of sports growing up and had lots of friends and was popular I guess I had plenty of girlfriends and was actually liked by people and friends but I do not where that went I do not feel like him I do not feel me. I literslly do not feel like me. The only time I ever do is en I am all alone like iwatch videos or listen to music loud enough to anyone can hear it so that thEy do not think I am weird or I do not honestly even know I just do not want to be alone anymore I want to be liked and wanted for me and I do not see that happening ever. I feel too much pressure to even talk to anyone let alone be around them for longer than a passing by. I feel as If I am being shown pity anytime anyone talks to me or is around me. I feel as if its all just to make me feel better. Vs actually wanting to be around me for me. I do not think I am good anymore and I think its over honestly. I am just so tired of everything and the pressures and the feelings that come with literally opening my mouth or being around anyone. If I am not alone I cannot laugh without crying on the inside. I literally stop myself from laughing or feeling good by non stop negative thoughts pounding in my head and I scream and scream stop and help but I cannot get them out. I rationalize all of them and believe them to be logical and true and I am even in more pain that I am already in. I am so tireeeed please help actually I do not need help I just want to be wanted? No one understand the person I am. I try to express myself at times and it only ever leads to others getting hurt from my feelings. I feel as if I am not good enough anymore unless I am alone but I am tired of being alone. Alone is painful alone is basically like being around 2849472937293637494 people who hate you and are telling you why at every second and thinking that everyone hates you or that they pity you or doing a favor or anything. I spend every waking moment trying to make others happy because when I do that I can at least know that for that second that person knows that it was ME that made them happy. And its getting to the point where I am running out of energy for everything I can barely finish laughs I can barely be in a public setting especially not sober. I am sorry for burdening everyone with this I could have kept going but its getting hard to type with all the tears. I hope everyone is okay always if anyone needs any help please let me know Ill do whatever I can to help somebody not feel any percent of this. I seriously will. Idk why I am even typing this.",0

I am 23 and have not really been happy for as long as I can remember in high-school I was actually popular I was the only one at my school woth a brand new street bike I played football and had lots of friends but I just was never happy I would always just choose to be alone instead of going out and experiencing life and tried to commit suside 2 times before I graduated and I thought it would get better but now I am 23 I am really attractive (according to my friends) I eat well I work out a lot i have a few good friends and have a loving girlfriend of 3 years but even still I am not happy I do not know why I sit up in bed after she falls asleep and just cry myself to sleep I am starting to think there is actually something wrong with me and I am thinking about seeing a doctor to see if they can help but I know anti depressants destroy your brain and make you dependent on them to be happy... I just do not know if I should take them or not because I do not knoe what it actually takes to be happy Does it get better? Like does it really ever get better or do you have to damage your brain with chemicals to make it better?,0

"I feel like I am definitely not allowed to cry or show emotions, yesterday evening I tried to write about my emotions and to me I felt like even writing that i feel sad is a failure or makes me a weak person. I feel like if i cry that means i am too sensitive or that i just need to stop being wet. Its so weird when it comes to jokes and stuff like that it takes a lot to offend me or make me feel uncomfortable i have a very dark sense of humour, so in that aspect i would not say I am very sensitive, however if I am in a bad mood someone could make a simple throw-away comment and I would get offended. Like i do not understand myself to be honest. I feel like eating my emotions feels like the only way to deal with my emotions because I feel like most people cope with their mental health by constantly using humour so does that make the people who cope with their mental health by crying, weird or weak or that they are just too sensitive I am eating my emotions and I do not know how to get out of this",1

No one is fixing you because no one can. I guess it feels like no one cares because we do not care about ourselves anymore, and that is scary. Unpopular opinion: What does the suicidal mind even want when it says no one cares?",1
"hi, I want to ask somebody here, how effective/proof is this way to commit suicide. my setup is going to be hot water tub and cutting arteria radialis both hands, also, as far as I know we have some genetics disorder in my family with blood beeing too clotting. I am going to prevent this by taking some aspirin (should made my blood a little bit thiner) and take a lots of water.Also I do not want to cut any of my tendonsis there some optional way to find better artery to cut? thx for responses :) hope I will find here some advicesbeen studying anatomy for a while now to make it as quick and as painless as possible. is it 100% death sure?",1
I am so fricken lost... friends family. All of it is not enough. Anyone who calls. Its okay. I just need to reassure I do not need to die.,1
"I have written so many words and lengthy cathartic monologue's to myself over the years that they are not really cutting it anymore. The words I use are old and they do not quite cover my feelings anymore. I have watched everyone surprass me. I have been used up and discarded more times than I care for at this point. I have nothing but the storm of hate and despair that I feel all the time now. I am so angry and so lost. I have no hope and I have exhausted most of my options of self-help. I can always continue and always survive, but I am not really progressing and I am not really becoming what I want to become. I cannot get a job, I have been denied University funding, my wife did not want me and I am stuck in my childhood home of abuse. I cannot seem to make money online anymore and those options are few anyway. I have used up all the limited help there is and I do not really see a way to proceed anymore. I am thinking that perhaps it is time and maybe it will finally be a relief rather than a regret. it is sad, but it is what it is. I think the greatest illusion I ever sold myself is that I was going to be successful. The potential was there, but it was too stacked against me and I guess I am not strong enough. At 33 with no income and no accomplishments other than small personal goals, I think it might be time to just accept defeat. The path grows darker",1

Every single day I sit here and feel like no matter what I do or how hard I try, my situation does not improve. Rent is so high and jobs pay so little I cannot afford to move right now. I battle with my brain from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. Everyone in my family is talking about me behind my back and not doing anything to help me. I have asked for advice and help several times from them and my friends. They all ignore me and my friends abandoned me because I am not important to them. I feel like I am in this all alone. I have a very loving and caring boyfriend but I feel like I overwhelm him with my issues so I do not like to involve him at all. He always says hes here for me and I know he is. But my anxiety says different My problems are bigger than me and I cannot do shit about it. No one said it would be like this. Your 20s are the best years of your life!",0

"I have wanted to die for more than half my life and the last few months have been the worst of 29 years of misery. I have been having breathing problems for a month and on Wednesday it got to the point where I needed medical attention. I was in the ER for 12 hours, alone, with no one to call who would give a fuck. It gave me a lot of time to reflect on how fucking horrible and inescapable the pain in my life is.And I know this is going to cost thousands of fucking dollars I do not have. My internet is getting shut off Tuesday, the electric on Friday. My breathing issue is not solved. And I have other significant health problems that are costing me money and I am doing all this stuff to get better and keep myself alive for no fucking reason. I am broke and alone and that is all Ill ever be. I wish I would have died on Wednesday. Had a medical emergency Wednesday, wish I had not gone to the hospital",1

I have not worked since the end of 2019 and developed agoraphobia last year because of the pandemic. I am so afraid and get irrationally nervous every time I leave my room. My last remaining grandma died last week, I cannot afford to make it to her funeral tomorrow that is literally 1,000 miles away from me. My friends that I trusted are both gone. they have both abandoned me and I hate myself because it seems like I just cannot win. I see progress from other people which makes me question myself for hours on end, wondering what I am doing wrong. I wake up with a black cloud over my head that seems to constantly follow me everywhere. I cannot get this life thing right and honestly I am so tired of trying.

I am really scared though, he wants to check me into an inpatient program and I have never done anything like this. I am only 21 and I have been open with my parents about suicidal thoughts in my teenage years when I still lived with them and they never cared or basically told me I was fine bc I had a good life.

My 2 best friends killed themselves in March of this year. I do not even want to be here anymore. My anxiety is so bad i throw up whenever i enter a classroom. And my adhd makes it nearly impossible to do online learning. I do not have a future anyway. I have been at my girlfriend's house for almost a week and she treats me like I am not even here most of the time. I plan on walking out to the highway and just walking into the cars in less than an hour. Its midnight so it would not be very difficult. I do not know anymore, i do not want to die.

Everyday is nothing, every sleepless nights spent dwelling on the past. Cycle after cycle it never changes, never stops. Pain increasing, no where to go.

I have been getting anxiety attacks left and right. I have lost so much. I lost my family on my dad's side. I lost my grandparents and Aunt on my mom's side. I feel like I am losing. My girlfriend I feel like is trying to distance herself from me, but from what I was told she is not. However she wants to be Poly, and idk if I can follow that path without being crushed. Ig I will give it a chance. Maybe that might change. She does not want to lose me, yet I think this is her excuse to get away from me to make it seem harmless. I am losing.

"First of all I wanted to apologize to anybody reading this because most of the people here probably have it much worse than I do. I have supportive friends and family and my mom and step dad make enough money. So, I understand that I should not really be feeling this way.I feel like I am wasting everyone is time with being alive. I am a very awkward and boring selfish ass hole and people still seek out hanging out with me. I feel like they should be hanging out with other people instead of me as they would have more fun that way. Last week I was drunk 6 nights that week (I am not 21) and my friend told me it was sad to watch and people just have to watch me be drunk. He was not trying to be mean. He is right actually. I just cut the shit out of my upper thigh out of self hatred and I just wish that I could have never existed in the first place. I realize that if I killed myself people would probably be sad and disappointed in me but I still really want to kill myself which is extremely selfish. I do not deserve to be happy. I think peoples lives might be better if I killed myself they just do not know it. I am just a pussy who only cares about myself.Sorry this was just a random rant.

"I could improve myself in quite a few ways, but it would be like polishing a turd, because I still would not be good enough. Maybe I would go from a 2 to a 3. I am not good enough for anyone - not for friends and certainly not for a partner. Why pick up hobbies? I do not feel like I deserve to smile. Why should such an ugly thing like me smile? I do not have any talent, but it would be silly if I did. I cannot create anything, because I hate myself and I am ugly, and creating something beautiful would be ironic and would feel like a lie. I am in my early 20s and I am beginning to bald on the top of my head. If God is real, he has a cruel sense of humor. let us just add that on to how messed up I am already, thanks. I feel envious of people who effortlessly obtain friendships and relationships. People who have the time of their lives partying, hanging out with friends, hooking up.... Things I have never gotten to do. I see everyone all around me feeling good, feeling happy, having fun... and I am just here, feeling shameful about who I am and likely to never experience anything close to what they have on the daily. I wish I could experience it all just once, so I can move on and be done with it. I do not want to keep missing out. I want life to stop laughing at me. I do not know what to do. Even if I do improve I am still never going to be good enough for anyone. Ugly, talentless, and stupid. My receding hair is like a clock ticking until I become a truly lost because anyway. I am bi, so I get to be rejected by absolutely everyone on sight. I wish things would get better. Or that I can wake up one day and no longer care that I am always going to be alone.

"About 2.5 years ago I was severely depressed and suicidal. My whole life fell apart and every day was torture. Though, now that I have my life back on track, despite the ever lingering depressive thoughts, I miss the carelessness of being depressed. Back then I was at my end. I had nothing to lose except my life which I did not value anyway. It gave me a great sense of freedom. Ironically, that same 'having nothing to lose' feeling/mindset is what helped me get out of my depression and rebuild my life. It is a powerful feeling when you having not to lose but everything to gain. In a relatively short amount of time, I managed to get back to my studies, get a new place, new friends, a girlfriend, several jobs. it is good I guess, but now I can no longer be or even feel careless. I have things to lose now, and so with it comes the fear of losing it. The constant worry of having to maintain these things and keep going is exhausting. From time to time it makes the depressive and suicidal thoughts come back or worse. it is like a paradox from which you cannot escape. A limbo of suffering. I miss the carelessness of being depressed",0
"I was raised by my grand parents because my parents broke up and left me when i was very little. When i was a child the only people i could talk to was my grand parents because i had no one other than them. I am the only child and i had no family other than my grand parents. I also never had a friend because i rarely see people other than my grand parents. I do not know how to talk to young people like me and make friends, because all my life I have been around really old people. I like my grand parents but I am really tired of being around old people, they suck all my energy and make me feel like I am old too. I do not really have anything to talk with them now so they just watch tv all day and we do not talk much. So the problem is, I am in my room all day, with nothing to do, no one to talk and nowhere to go. When i go outside, i see people around their friends and family and knowing that I am all alone makes me feel worthless. So i feel bad and head home again. But there is nothing to do at home so i start thinking, questioning my life and existence. And that makes me feel worse because i got nothing and no one to live for.

For a while, I could not figure out what was going on until I did research this week about how the medication is linked with depression. Sure, Id like to keep my hair but mental health is far more important. I plan on stopping the medication tomorrow and wanted to see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

"I have no friends, I have no life, I have never kissed a girl and I am turning 22 this year. Dropped out of high school because education in China is dog sh*t, (yes I am from China) basically a psychological conditioning education designed to break you so you do not go against the Chinese government when you are old enough to understand what is going on. Internet censorship is increasingly restricted, could not afford to study abroad. I was given many opportunities to make a difference in my life but I threw them away like garbage, taking things from granted. I was young and stupid, chose comfort whenever possible. Now I am at the lowest point in my life, I am tired of fighting, tired of not having the rights a human shall deserve, worse yet I am cannot leave the country because China is denying passport for ordinary citizens, the government keeps telling lies in faulty logic. Ironically my English is way better than my native language, Chinese language is really stupid in terms of thinking. I am really tired of admiring a freer life that I could never have. I am think I am going to say peace to this f*cked up life of mine. Good thing there is a pandemic going on making suicide less inconvenient. I have respiratory problems, substance abuse, long story. If I am contracted COVID I am think this is it for me. Was thinking about seeking international protection, I was persecuted for being a more open minded person, but from what I have seen UNHCR in Asia is a joke. I really do not know what to do. I am tired.",1
"My 1st time posting here, today is one of those days where I generally feel nothing. I am not happy &amp; I am not sad I am just. One of the things I hate most about myself is how I seem to self sabotage any happiness I might actually have. I do it all the time, I feel like if something is good then it definitely will not last so I take control &amp; ruin it that way at least when it did happen it was myself that decided when it was supposed to end. I want to stop this repetitive behaviour but do not know how. Any advice would be much appreciated. Self Sabotage",0

"So yeah, I do not know any of you but, I feel like i got to tell someone at least. I lost my best friend recently due to a miscommunication, and I really do not have anyone else. I have a family, but ever since I came out as trans, things have been rocky. I am not very scared anymore about ending it all, feels nice thinking about it. I lost my job due to covid, still been trying to finda notehr one ever sicne, I have had chronic headaches that would not go away unless i took 6 aspirins a day. I know I am not perfect, and putting everyone and everything above meis annoying and discouraging for others. I am 30 y/o andI have nothing to look forward to, never had.

"I really do not give a shit anymore. I do not want to experience all these forced feelings that i have. After some certain events unfold, it will truly make no difference if i live the rest of my life like a vegetable or in current state. I am just waiting for all of this to be over.

I think I have given myself brain damage. I have no emotion. only dark thoughts. that is all. I am gone so far into this dark pit I do not think I will ever be able to live a normal life again. suicide is on my mind. when I am bored I make suicide notes up in my head. I do not even know why I am saying this here. I guess I just need to let it out. I cannot keep a routine. my sleep schedule is terrible. I barely see sunlight anymore.I just want to rest. writing this at 6am. accepting I am depressed. I am weak minded.",0

Because for some reason i hate seeing how I am smiling and how i look happy in those pictures while in real life I am suffering.

"Hello I am new here and I wanted to get these things off of my chest. I have found myself struggling the couple year with depression even though I have been dealing with it for years. I found a partner two years ago and fell in love but my depression took ahold of my relationship. I was outgoing and had a great outlook on life after leaving a school for software development. It started going downhill quickly after. I could not find work in the field, I was struggling financially, and I started losing my confidence with my partner. I found myself in outbursts of anger and guilt being so stressed out. Later in the relationship I was cheated on. I was broken and did not take any of it lightly. Once I hurt myself dealing with the pain. We became pregnant and everything was looking upwards then I was going through a paternity test in the beginning of Covid-19. It lasted for months to find out and instead of patiently waiting. I was completely depressed and self isolating daily. Moving forward to now I have not left that place my relationship is in shambles I am not outgoing, caring, or taking care of myself at all. I still get angry and cannot control my emotions on a day to day basis. One moment I am happy and I try to cling onto it as much as possible but it slips away so quickly. My thoughts completely take over and all of a sudden I think something is wrong. This is reoccurring almost daily. I feel like each time I only push my partner away even further. I sometimes think she would be better offf with someone else since we keep splitting and coming back together. I wish I was the person before all of this. Now I am barely holding onto myself Holding on to glimmers of happiness",0
"My city is in flames and I am barely holding on I feel like my family are oblivious to what is going on, I cannot believe my life is just getting worse and worse along with everyone else here but I am truly scared as I feel I have nothing left in me. I almost want to end it before something even more traumatizing happens. I am staying alive for my cats and the guy I love but he can easily just move on and find someone better, maybe even closer to him without all this bs that I have to endure. This situation in my country makes me so sad and depressed, I am putting on a brave face but I am crushed inside.. I feel like I am trapped truly trapped and there is no way out but to endure more and more. The days seems more and more bleak, we have food shortages, pet food shortages and soon maybe internet cut off as with water. I am devastated. I do not know anymore",1
2 weeks ago I wanted to write a big post. But now I honestly do not know what to say anymore. I am craving physical pain to avoid emotional pain I am losing hope again for the last 10 years,1
Just left work early. Was supposed to work until 4am. No way with my lack of will to live. I am so tired. I am so tired of working long hours just to fucking survive. I am not happy. I feel forced to live. We are born to go to school for 12 or more years and work until we die. I am just a slave. I barely get time for myself or sleep. The lack of sleep is driving me insane. I just want to sleep forever. I am going to overdose tonight. there is no turning back with me leaving my job. I think I am going to do it tonight,1
"I know some people that want to live and turn their life around because they want to. But I just do not, I do not want to do anything that might help me, I do not WANT to take care of myself, eat right, or go to therapy. How do I get to the step of even wanting to wanting to actually want to take care of myself? I am so over this bull, this probably does not make sense but it makes sense in my head. How do I make myself want to live?",0
"I moved to Utah about a year and a half ago. We went outside of the polluted city for the first time during the pandemic. We stayed for so long that it was pitch-black on the drive home. I looked out the car window and was able to see the entire milkyway, millions of stars and the bluish purple hues. I was so overwhelmed because it was my first time seeing so many stars. I felt like I was going to fall in to the sky. All I could think about since that was that I wanted to go out in the wild again and lay down and watch the stars all night. During some very tough days this past year, my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do, he was ready to take me anywhere and make it happen just to see me happy again. I asked him to take me to see the stars again. Its so fucking cliche, I am so sorry but that is just what I really wanted. So he promised me. We never actually went. Whenever it comes up, its always either too expensive, too dangerous, I am not trying hard enough to plan it, hes not super interested in seeing it anyway etc. We have been wanting to go somewhere but everything is too expensive and not worth it. Yet he goes out drinking every weekend and ends up spending hundreds of dollars and gets trashed.Yesterday he was on the phone with one of his friends and his friend mentioned going to a popular camping spot (also popular star gazing spot) and within minutes they planned a trip to go the next day. I was in the room and could hear the entire conversation. They went out drinking to discuss the plans and I was not invited or even looked at in the face. I left his apartment and went home. I feel so betrayed and lonely. Am I overreacting? Maybe, but considering it was literally the only thing my depressed ass wanted to do, I think its okay to feel extremely upset and want to break up with him because I literally have no worth to him. I am not good enough to camping with for 1 night, not even good enough to be invited to the one thing I wanted to do. And if its another event I am always invited last minute and never have time to get ready and he complains that hes sick of explaining why I do not show up at events. I feel like hes just setting me up for failure and complaining to me about it. I had only one thing I was actually looking forward to this entire year and my boyfriend betrayed me",0
"Its just a dice roll on how I am going to feel that day, its either good, meh, or terrible, and I am having a lot less of the good and more of the meh, but no matter how I feel that day the thoughts of insignificance, life having no meaning, not knowing what I want to do with my life, feeling like I am wasting my life are always there. I fucking hate it, I know life can be beautiful and fun and Its not like I do not experience that and enjoy the day to day now and then but most of the time I just feel crushed and defeated and lost and hopeless. Its just the same thing day in and day out and I do not have the motivation or drive to do anything other than sit around and watch tv. My interests, hobbies, passions are all still there I just do not have the motivation to care for them, sometimes they feel boring even when I wanted to do them. Not wanting to exist is just a normal for me now, but even that feels wrong, I know I want to be here and get better but sometimes it does not even feel like the depression it just feels like waking up to the shitty reality of the world. Every means of survival has been monetized, working an 8hour desk job is the only way to feasibly survive for 99% of people, the state of the country is shit, the state of the world is shit, the world might not even be livable in 100 years. I just want to be able to wake up with something to live for besides the possibility of it all getting better because that is the only thing keeping me moving. I do not know how long I have been living with whatever form of mental illness I have got going on but last October is when it started getting bad and now its unbearable. And I hate to say this decline happened during Covid because it feels like it invalidates how I am feeling, you know everyone is going through the same thing, its just the pandemic, and all of the other BS. I hate the way I feel but do not know what to do to change it",0
Can I dm someone please about relationship related stuff? I need some help,0
"Does anyone else feel like you are never going to be happy? I have been depressed most of my life, over the last year and half I have been on an antidepressant. Its helped my anxiety but I am not necessarily happy, just numb. Is this as good as it gets? I was talking to my doctor earlier trying to explain to him that I do not feel good and I have not for a long time and maybe we should switch antidepressants because I do not think this one is helping (and causing weight gain, fatigue, exhaustion, etc) and he was just like nope you are fine and completely ignored my concerns. Does it ever get better or am I just destined to be miserable for the rest of my life Worried I am never going to be happy",0
"I do not want to be spend my 20s worrying about my 30s. Being anxious about the rest of my life. I just want to be present. And I think I have been even giving myself anxiety thinking about my future so much. what is going to happen, when am I going to die, who am I going to marry. It has bombarded my thoughts and honestly has just been a weight. Truly life is uncontrollable. there is no way of trying to pinpoint what is going to happen next or what will happen 10 years from now. Just be present today. The reality is one day life will continue on without you. Just like a train. When it is your time, you will get off and that train will continue. And there is no way of stopping that. I think I am starting to understand the scripture that says ""Worry not about your life, for today's worries are enough. And the worrying is not going to help. So I would rather spend time just trusting the one who gives life. I just want to be present.",0
"I was heavily considering killing myself in December 2019, and honestly, the idea was never completely out of my head prior to that either. I wish I did. I wish every single day that I did.Things were finally getting better and I had just received a handful of amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities the week before the pandemic officially started a you.S. lockdown. I had one week. Just one week that I did not think about dying every single morning and every single night.Everything has been hell. I lost my apartment and had to move home because the person I moved in with went absolutely insane and had a total breakdown and started aggressively forcing me to live by her conspiracy theory rules. (Covid is spread via the sidewalk, covid is spread via open windows in the air two stories up, the windows needed to be boarded up, never once leaving the apartment in a year, etc.)Covid is a completely different experience for those who have significant others and a stable living situation. I had neither. I tried so hard to go on dating sites so I would not be completely alone. But people would lovebomb me and then when I was invested they would start being abusive and degrading and cruel. I gave up.It feels like women genuinely do not care about anything other than their boyfriends no matter how progressive or new age they are. All of my female friends revolved their entire lives around their boyfriends since the pandemic started, and honestly before that too.I hate being home. I despise it. But I social distanced as much as possible. I was guilted or shamed by people for going out, and guilted and shamed by people for staying in. It felt like all my female friends would always justify that they constantly visited their boyfriends, or spent all their time with their boyfriends. But if I ever saw a friend once a month, it was frowned upon.Why? Why is it so taboo and wrong for me to be social just because it was not with someone who I was fucking.My friends all made me realize that it is impossible to ever get structure unless I somehow manage to find a significant other. But I have tried so hard to date and almost every time has been a traumatic experience.I am so jealous of them. I hate them. I do not want to hate my friends. But I feel so angry. I feel so misunderstood. Absolutely NONE of the people who judged me would ever go through what I went through.I moved back home with my parents from a huge city to a town with 800 people. My parents, I love very much but they are both abusive. I did not have a choice. I had to leave my apartment because my roommate had stopped working and paying rent. I would have had to pay the entire 2 bedroom rent if I stayed.I feel like a burden. I wish I had just died. there is no place for me in this world. I have not been happy in two years. I lost everything. I will never have a life that is rewarded in a pandemic. I am not meant to be happy &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I will only ever destroy my life and I do not deserve happiness I wish I killed myself before the pandemic",1
"I am (23f) so tired of being alive. Saying I have had a tough couple of years is an understatement. Many family members have died from suicide or drug overdose, sexual assaults, and just day to day misery. I have become addicted to drugs, one of which being heroin. But it does not make me happy. Nothing makes me happy. My boyfriend says I make his life miserable, I know I make everyone is life miserable. I am just a self centered bitch. My mom was just diagnosed with MS and she should not have to deal with me. I know my death would hurt her a lot but I am so so tired. I want it to be over",1
"I was just getting to a point where I did not want to drive my car off the nearest bridge, and then boom: serious medical issues. I am losing my vision. I am in pain. I have visual disturbances. Thanks to the new meds and some freaking issue in my brain I also have auditory disturbances. So essentially I feel like I am going ducking crazy. I am only writing this rn because I am stuck with insomnia. I am pretty sure I had a seizure earlier and my husband just rolled over and was like hmm? Like thanks idk what is happening but glad ur on it bruh. My pituitary gland is flattened out? Idk if that can because all of these intense mood changes, or if its the Nortriptyline I was started on. Anyways, really fighting the urge todo it. The hard part is that I know how easy it would be to do it and make it look like a total accident - but I have a 2 yr old who is autistic and it feels like I am the only one in our family that does what is best for him. So I have to stay. But I STG if I do lose my vision and am actually blind, I will just do it. I am an artist by trade. How tf just yeah. I am thankfully about to pass out and go to sleep thanks to some anti nausea meds. Thanks for reading my rant Pseudotumor side effects",1
"I know there is no way to turn back time, as its just a fantasy imagination. If there was a way to turn back time, I would apologize to those close to me about my behavior and mistakes. In the present day now, an ex-friend of mine has brainwashed another friend of mine into turning against me. I have always felt lonely and did not feel appreciated. Ever since last week and this week, I have been looking up ways to kill myself. The friend that was turned against me would ask me what I was doing everyday, and I would say I am watching videos, but instead watching ways how people killed themselves.I just wanted to feel appreciated and cared about, but I cannot have that. When my friend hugged me weeks ago in a library, I was thinking this would be my last hug before I go. He always made me happy and laugh a lot, and that would be the last. I wish this pandemic did not exist, because it made the people I was friends with different now. I want someone who can listen to how I feel and to be comforted. Someone who can give warm hugs and supportive advice, a shoulder to cry on. I do not know when to do it, but when I find a day and time, I will finally be happy. If turning back time was real",1
when does it get better when does it stop when do i stop being this way when does it end when will i feel better what the fuck is fucking wrong with me why am i fucking like this what the actual fuck I am not even supposed to be here I am not here but I am here but i shoudlnt be here i should be gone i do not deserve to be here what the fuck,1

I am always tired and just want to sleep all day. it is the only thing that makes me feel happy. it is great to imagine being a different me, in a happier life. I have a lot of self-hate and pretending to be someone I am not, makes me feel better the moment I am dreaming, but only makes the pain hurt more once I wake up. I have tried to talk about these things to my mom, but it is hard to confide in a parent who constantly manipulates you and emotionally abuses you. Anytime I wanted to talk about anything, it always ends up being my fault. it is mentally, and physically draining. My dad on the other hand is someone I could confide in, but I feel it would because more problems. My parents are constantly fighting, and my dad is an alcoholic. There has been some physical abuse, but never towards me. it is so painful and sad to watch my parents fight, and I am just stuck. I have nowhere to go. No one to talk to.

"I feel like I am being enveloped in dark flames of depression, and if I do not get out soone Ill jump of a bridge. I thought about it so much when I was at jos the other day. With elli snoring beside me and no snoring on the other room. I imagined centrally slipping on my shoes and quietly leaving the house, walking in the dark to the foot bridge, while cars blur around me and drunk people stumble past me. I imagine being at the top of that bridge and looking at the water with lights reflecting off it. Then struggling to get over the railing because of my heaight and weight but no doubt getting over it from determination, then turning around to face the water now with no barrier. And just falling, letting my body be free, thinking nothing, I imagine falling for a second before hitting the freezing water, I wonder if it would be incredibly painful, or would it be delayed, perhaps Id mistake the pain for the cold water, I wonder what Id do then, would I be a coward and try to get out, regretting my choice or would I let the cold water take over my tired body, would I face into the dark water or look up to the sky? Would I drown? If I did perhaps that would be good and then if I failed what would happen then? Would I be fished out by someone or would I just gradually make my way to the shore? What then? Look around and what if noones there to help? Would I make my way back to jos whiles my feet make wet sounds against the pavement, in my dazed state would I notice the stares from the drunkards or the way a car stopped just as I walked out onto the street to cross to get to jos? Or would my senses be alert? Who knows how would I explain? I do not know, at the end of the day this is just a scenario but one I have thought about a lot, perhaps I will try it next time I got to jos or perhaps I will take control finally and be happy, choose happiness finally TW - Me ranting/ imaging read at risk",1
"I have a job that I hate, almost graduated with a degree that I will not even be able to use because my partner wants to live somewhere it is useless.

I am always there for anyone who needs me but now I need someone and I am by myself. Everyone is just too busy for me. I hurt myself superficially and I know my partner is going to be furious with me If she sees if/when she comes back to the house tonight. My family disowned me years ago and the only person who speaks to me now is my abusive mother. All I have got in the world to live for is my cat, who probably only has a year or so to live anyway (he is old and his heart is failing him). I keep trying to tell myself that I have to keep going for something but I cannot think of anything I want to do that I could ever do, or anyone who would miss me, genuinely not just for attention on social media (mother). I know my partner would take care of my cat, he really likes her and probably would not even notice I was gone. I just cannot think of any good reasons to keep fighting, I have tried so hard for so long and I think I have finally run out of steam.

"I am tired, I feel like shit 24/7. The older I get the worse things become. I am the youngest of 3. I am in my late 20s now and everyday is just as shitty as the next. People want nothing to do with me, I am ugly, every interaction I have has so much negativity towards it its ridiculous. I can just sense the awkwardness and how much someone wants nothing to do with me. People do not want to talk to me or look at me. It gets hard. It gets harder when you see how people treat others so differently. I mean your own parents do not like talking about you and in all honestly they wish you would just get the fuck away. Like I do not exist. I know everyone secretly hates me and it in all honestly it all comes down to appearance. If I did not get trapped with the worst fkn genetics life would be soDifferent. I would kill to be either one of my brothers. Life is just natural for them, they have friends and no constant reminder of how unwanted they are by society and any one for that matter. Like everyone has a general understanding of their own self awareness and where they stand among others. Like my own self is such ass. I am not lovable. I also have an underlying body infection that I believe has messed with my mental and physical health severely. However I think about to high school and college days and I have always been a loser/loner since I can remember and its all because of the negative feedback I feel from others like it sucks. Its to the point now that if I kill myself now no one will bat an eye. I just cannot go on anymore",1

And i had my first meeting with a psychologist from my college. She helped me a lot, i even thought that ill finally be free. That i will not feel like that anymore.Guess i was lying to myself again.I just feel like if was done, like i could not fight with sadness anymore, as if it won.I do not know if ill be able to stay, i do not want to live anymore, and its been months, i do not even feel alive anymore.Just emptiness, I am tired, i do not know what i should do After weeks of no suicidal thoughts I am just done",0

"Before I had depression, I was smart and bubbly. I loved to learn but I was also creative. Growing up, I won art competitions quite often. I liked to sketch and I just found it peaceful and therapeutic. There was just a lot that I was interested in.And now I am nothing like that person. Academics are hard because I am too depressed to try. I stopped sketching the second I became depressed.

"Previous post:  I went to a big BBQ with family and friends which usually means drinks and someone with a vape pen. I did not partake in either and I have to say that I am really proud of myself. The good feeling I have is definitely motivating, and in a small way, I feel like I have a purpose these days by just making it through without those things. I remember feeling similarly when I quit cigarettes: I would remind myself that even if I was having a shit day, I was not smoking and that was good enough.I went to therapy today and told my therapist about how I have been actually feeling BETTER finally. I was happy to tell her that I am feeling more like myself. I do not know whether I should give credit to the med change or the absence of drinking/smoking but we figured that there is no need to figure that out just yet-- I just need to roll with it for now. I hope that this feeling lasts. DAY 6 of doing the right thing",0

So I am a 24 year old virgin guy and I am just too shy to talk to girls and its become even more awkward now that I am so old yet still a virgin. I have decided to give online dating a go but I have had absolutely no luck because almost everyone is a bot or does not reply to me (I am an ugly mf and I am boring so I do not blame them) Anyway I have given myself 3 months (till I am 25) to turn my life around and get in a relationship and lose my v plates etc so was just wondering what other people would do knowing they only have 3 months to live before they potentially self-forever-sleep. And yeah I am serious about the suicide part. My only friend already talked me off a train bridge just a month ago by saying everything will get better and everyone has problems etc but being a lonely virgin is not something you can just 'fix' overnight (well it is but you get the point haha) and yeah I am not going to be a 25 year old virgin because next thing I will be a 26 year old virgin and so on. What would you do with 3 months left before suicide?,1
I spent the day alone locked in my room like all other holidays. It must be nice to have people that actually care about you and you can spend time with. Happy Fourth of July :),0
I am so tiredIm so so tired Why does nobody care?? Fucks sakeIm fucking useless. I want to be gone,1
"I have a friend who is really extroverted and always smiling but has these short random moments of suicidal thoughts and death. It started around an year ago and slowly became more and more prevalent. She would say dark things jokingly when it is clearly not funny. E.g. ""would not it be funny if i had a bath with a toaster."" ""I wonder how many people would come to my funeral if i died lol."" I have also noticed she does risky things like run through traffic without looking and speed a lot more. Also her brother died in a motorcycle accident an year ago but she would never seem sad about it and sometimes casually brings up his death like she is talking about the weather. All my friends say she is just an emo wannabe and she is fine but I am like 60% sure she is really depressed and thinking about suicide. What can i do about this? What to do when you are not sure if a friend is suicidal or not?",0
there is a lot Id love to write out and share but I have stopped seeing the point. It will not change my circumstances sadly. The end is near for me. I can feel it. I am very sad that its come to this. Wasted potential. Good luck everyone. Try whatever you need to. Do whatever it takes to feel better. Exhaust all options until there is nothing left. Not even myself anymore. Not someone I recognise. Goodbye So much I want to say but too tired to write,1
"I always have been. First i was the clown which was annoying af for some years, tho i was funny. When i realised i was making everyone hate me i became a very introvert socially awkard idiot who cannot make jokes anymore. Today i was in a Camp with some friends and my room mate and another guy from another room went home, so it is 2 days I am saying that I will go in a room with 2 Friends, and when they left another guy took my place seconds before i arraived and everyone said it is ok because they prefered him. I asked others of i could join their room and they said no. So here i am, i finally decided it is the right fucking time to just isolate myself and never try to make any friends at all, since i suck at the sport i play and i list my ability to be funny and i never had the ability of being likeable. I hate being the least favorite friend",0
"My sibling is trans (17, pre-op, ftm, he/them). Our parents are good parents, some bumps here and there. they are opposed to my sibling transition. I support my sibling, but I am not very good with words and kind of a coward. I have a hard time standing up to our dad about it. Our dad is a good man, but he is a butt sometimes. he is so supportive with both of us wanting to pursue artistic careers, teaching us how to be more independent, and will never abandon his us. he is firm about keeping us all together (since he is distanced himself from certain distant family). he is talked us both down from trying to kill ourselves more than once. But he seems so apathetic when it comes to this. I feel guilty for not being able to properly comfort them when they get depressed about it. My sibling and I are both LGBTQ+, are bipolar, have depression, and have anxiety, so I kind of understand how it feels when Dad acts like that. Our Dad has a bisexual sister and loves her (even though she always gets into trouble), so I know he does not hate us for being LGBTQ+. he is not exactly traditional either (he wants his daughters to be independent), so why cannot he be more supportive? I think it is the ""transition"" part he does not like. Maybe he is scared that my sibling will hate that body as well, if not worse. I understand the sentiment, but my sibling is dead set on developing a masculine body. I want to pay for it myself, but cannot. (I am 19, not a guardian, and broke). What can I do to comfort my sibling? Any good advice or thoughts? How do I comfort my trans sibling?",1
"I am a very ugly person. I wish I looked like everyone else, then life would be perfect like theirs. I have never been in a relationship or kissed a girl, god forbid lose my virginity. It is not worth living in my body. If only people cared about personality and not only looks. I am only happy when I put myself in other people's skin and imagine what life would be like as them. Luckily I have a bunch of fucked up health stuff so nature will take its course soon. If not in the next year I will probably take my own life. I do not actually have anyone in my life who would care if I killed myself so luckily I will not feel guilty while doing it. Not worth living when you are ugly",1
"does not matter what I do, what I have, how much money I have hobbies and ""fun"" seem like an escape.I feel ok most of the time, but then realize how I always look towards the future in hopes of living better: I feel like I do not have talents and do not have passions, I feel like a failure and I do not feel confident in myself. I do not feel satisfied",0
"Nobody cares about me. Everyone treats me like a nuicense. I do not want to live in this world with such terrible things. I am not sure if there is an afterlife but I would rather jsut end it than see it through just to be treated like shit. Idk why I was put in a world full of such terrible things because they just ruin it. I think if i was gone it would just be better for everyone. This world is just not good to me and idk what I did to deserve it. I know this post is super edgy and whatever but this is really how I feel. To me the reality is just there is nothing TO live for. it is just about how you want to live your life. And since there is nothing to mine, I do not want to live it.Thanks for reading, and goodbye I do not want to live in such a terribly cruel world",1
"I feel like there is this deep, dark, hollow, senseless, sightless, eerie, buzzing, whispering sadness trapped somewhere inside me that I cannot get access to but it is affecting me every day in a way I cannot grasp. it is like a poisonous snake trapped inside my chest and I want to cut it open and pull it out so fucking bad.it is like being trapped in a cave a thousand miles beneath the ground and not even being able to panick at the sight of inevitable death because nobody knows I am there.Please just make it stop! Please get it out of me, get it out!",0
"about a year ago, i made a half-assed attempt at an OD and ended up in the hospital for the night. when they asked me what had happened, i said that it was an accident and, no, i was not trying to kill myself. and despite how obviously emotionally unstable i was, they all either believed me and did not care to call my bluff. even my family did not see through my bs. neither the hospital psychiatrist nor my psychiatrist seemed to care enough to really look deeper. i know it is unfair to blatantly lie and expect people to see through it, but still. it is made me think about just how much I have lied to people. with most of the people i know, I have lied to them so much that how i am when I am lying just seems normal to them. and i think i keep doing it because it insulates me. but I have cut myself (and my ability to talk to other people about my feelings) so far off that it seems impossible to get out of it. i cannot even cry out for help anymore because I have isolated myself so that no one can tell. i feel like I have neutered my ability to be known. I have trapped myself in here alone the cries for help do not even work anymore",1
"I have been trying to get an appointment with a psychiatrist for weeks and with nobody taking any new patients amid the pandemic, I am left with nothing. I immediately panicked when I woke up this morning and started seizing. Refused to call the ambulance, and drove myself to the ER despite feeling blacked out. Now I am nervous they are about to admit me to an inpatient center due to the nature of the questions they are asking. I genuinely do not want burden my family with these bills. Advice, somebody 21F in the ER with intrusive thoughts",0
The urge is getting stronger each day. I need help. I am a much better person than this. Please bring me back to my sense. I truly missed my old self My suicidal tendencies started to develop into suicide+murder intention.,1
I alrwady talked with my therapist about it and she says its because of my traumas and that i cannot do much but I want to change it. Whenever I am out with my friends i feel lonely they talk to me etc but i just want to be in my bed again and want to cry. Its not that I hate my friends or anything but I simply cannot feel comfortable. On the other hand i want the friendship to continue otherwise I am even more lonely. Do you have a fix for feeling lonely when being around people?,0

"I am 22 and have no real hope for the future. i attempted college multiple times but each time i ended up having a total mental breakdown where i was completely detached from reality and ended up hospitalized, causing me to fall behind in classes. I have been hospitalized so many times i cannot even count (more than 5, less than 15 times). now i work at a fucking ice cream shop and feel/look like shit everyday. all i do is wake up, lay in bed, go to work, come home super late, lay in bed, repeat. days off are almost worst than work days since i have so much time to just mope and do nothing. I have pretty much completely isolated myself from my friends and family since i feel like such a loser. all i can think about is how disappointed they are in me and how much more functional and successful they are. socializing has also just become highly draining in generali never know what to say since i do not do shit and have no real goals. the only person i want to see/communicate with is my ex but he lives three hrs away from me and left me due to my illness anyway. we still talk everyday but knowing hes probably happier without me and will find someone else only makes me want to end it all. i seriously have nothing to live for. thanks for reading i just needed to vent publicly a little bit mental illness ruined my life",0
"Absolutely everything in my life is absolute garbage and it is never going to get better. I am getting absolutely zero quality out of life. Nothing brings me any level of joy or fulfillment anymore. I have way more bad days than good days. I cannot afford any kind of therapy or mental health care. I hate living in this greedy, money hungry, ignorant shameless world. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again. This world is an absolutely horrible place for anyone who is not rich or attractive. I am going to die with nothing but more bills to pay. Really thinking about ending it very soon",1

"HeyI'm Eli, 24, he/him. I feel as though I am out of options. For context, I have got bipolar 2, fibromyalgia/to-be-diagnosed nerve disorder. I have been at a call center job for 2 years prior to covid, and was entering my 5th year of a bach degree in 2020. I have essentially gone from being a full time student, part time call center worker, and part time active community member to absolutely nothing. More recently, I had an intense breakdown from a manic episode that soured and threw me into a deep and angry but apathetic depression. I have had a pain flare that is made me 100% unable to function at work, so I am (very thankfully) on disability pay from my job, and though I had to drop out of college the last semester, do a bunch of overhaul with credit transfers, I can now finish in an upcoming fall semester and a 2 week program the following summer and I would be graduated. I have got doctors appointments coming up to see if I can get answers for my chronic pain. I have all of these things look forward to, all these remedies, but all I can feel is fear and anxiety and an overwhelming desire to end my life.I am floating between at a fibromyalgia diagnosis right now and I am having some of the absolute worst pain of my life. The medication I have been put on has me exhausted for most of the day, shaking, and slow. I am just a blob right now. Different professionals have put me on a combo of a bunch of meds to mitigate anxiety, mood stability, etc. I am probably going to need a lumbar puncture as an MS diagnosis could be on the table and I have a blood draw tomorrow.I just feel like a hassle. Like, I go to seek help and am getting it slowly, but I am stuck dwelling on the idea that all these things are a waste of time. The I am just being a resource leech and nothing else, because who tf am I to be asking for extra assistance- and why provide it to someone who might commit anyway? I feel so selfish and self centered.I have got opportunities coming my way but I am so so afraid to move forward. I feel like I should have committed during 2020, but could not go through with it. I feel so awful when people put their necks out for me, only for me to fail or do a so-so job, to disappoint them. Coming back to my job, I need to confront a bunch of little errors from my calls, acknowledge and go over my work processes in depth and put my work under intense scrutiny when in fact I have made customer service mistakes, transferred someone to the wrong department, or fail to answer one of many many questions regarding vehicle accidents. coming back to work means more accountability. I know I am a bad person because I should be fine, but holding myself accountable, maintaining a schedule, sitting at a desk, thinking anything about it just sends my brain through the roof and makes me want to die. I do not want to be evaluated, I am so tired of not doing good enough feeling helpless",1
"they feel so real, then i wake up and its not. I am such a pussy and wish i would just do it. probably going to fuck around &amp; get myself a bunch of tattoos that i do not have the money for and then die. at least ill die with some dope art. i keep having dreams",1

"I am 25 years old. I have struggled with social anxiety, depression, disordered eating and gender dysphoria since I was 13. Twelve years of suffering. This past year-and-a-half the pandemic came along, of course, and destroyed any improvements I might have made prior to it (even if some of those were admittedly a bit of a facade, me convincing myself and others I would improved because ""I am doing this good thing now and I am not doing that bad thing anymore""). The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways; I feel like it is effects for me have been multiple and some of then I am feeling far more now (at the ""end"" of lockdown) than I ever did during the height of lockdown.there is the enforced isolation, which has increased my social anxiety tenfold, to the point where the loosening of restrictions only means I am isolating even more because there is too many people outside and I cannot cope with them seeing me, looking at me, interacting with me, forming an opinion of me - even a split-second, meaningless judgement is terrifying. I know it is irrational, but social anxiety has this way of making the irrational fears so loud and intrusive that they can become self-fulfilling. I can rationally say to myself, ""nobody cares, nobody's looking at you"". Then I take a 5 minute walk to the shop and have a panic attack due to being so overwhelmed with anxiety. Well now everyone is looking at you, because you are staggering around hyperventilating clutching your chest like you are having a heart attack, you dumb shit. Then there is all the time spent alone with my own thoughts, ruminating over every little thing I have ever said and done, punishing myself and berating myself for things I said without thinking back in ""normal"" times when face-to-face social interaction was a daily occurrence so I let my guard and filter down. I do not just mean cringey moments (although I have plenty of those too), but cruel or thoughtless comments and actions which honestly just make me a terrible human being. Then there is the doomscrolling. Literally, on news websites etc. but also figuratively, in my own mind, which was arguably the master of spiralling into negative and pessimistic thoughts about the world long before ""doomscrolling"" was even a term. Thinking about how we got here and where we are headed and how fucked up the world is. Overpopulation and overconsumption and human selfishness and speciesism mean future pandemics and local and global travesties are only going to get more common. This is not the ""end"", it is just the beginning. Climate change is always on my mind, to some degree. I feel helpless and hopeless, I do not believe humanity will change enough or in time to save this planet. I do the things I can, but I am painfully aware I could be doing more and be more of an activist if I was less depressed and self-pitying. I am also painfully aware that I could do everything in my power and it would not scratch the surface, so long as huge money-obsessed corporations continue to because more destruction in a day than I could in a year, even if I did not bother to try at all. My gender dysphoria is worse because I was forced to sit with my thoughts and acknowledge it for what it really is and always has been. Denial is not healthy, but it sure feels better sometimes than admitting an uncomfortable truth to yourself. And once you admit that truth? You have to fight tooth and nail to get the things required to finally feel comfortable in your own damn skin. I am lucky that coming out was relatively safe and painless for me in terms of others' reactions, and I am so grateful for that. But boy is it a lot of work having to repeatedly ""prove"" your identity to strangers, while constantly second-guessing it yourself (hello, imposter syndrome), only to be told everything is a 3 year wait and costs thousands. Fill out this form and take this test and pay for this consultation and even then you are not our ideal candidate, so we will get back to you. it is exhausting and I have so little fight left in me. Giving up means giving up any possibility that I will ever be happy but sometimes I still want to, just because I am tired of it. That last sentence was about my gender dysphoria, sure, but it is also how I feel about life as a whole. Suicide is giving up. A dead person cannot be happy, but they cannot be miserable either. I am also in physical pain that I cannot get looked at by a medical professional because the doctors need photo ID to update my name, which I do not have. My back and knees are a steady 3/10 when busy or distracted. 7/10 when I try to sleep, unless I am blackout drunk. 9/10 if I smoke weed, for some reason. Everyone talks about weed helping with pain, but if I smoke I am damn near calling myself an ambulance just to get high-strength painkillers because my back hurts so much. I feel fairly sure the physical pain is related to a sedentary lifestyle. I sit at work all day, then I sit and watch TV or go to bed early, I do not exercise because I am scared to go outside and besides I have no motivation. It cannot be good for me and I think my body is trying to tell me that. Every time I try to end a post like this I think of something else, another reason I feel so suicidal. Maybe I should focus on the positives? I am young, maybe not in tip-top physical condition but probably fixable to a decent standard of health/comfort with the right treatment and effort. I live in a wealthy country with access to everything I could ever need. I have a job, I am financially independent, I can make rent and pay for food and even luxuries. I have a family who love me (especially my mum, who means everything to me). I could probably be fairly attractive if I worked out and took better care of myself. I am not unintelligent and I have some compassion, so I could probably do things to help people and better the world if I put more effort in. All of these positives just fill me with so much guilt. I do not deserve these benefits or opportunities, they are wasted on me. Focusing on the positives makes me wish someone else could take my place and be in my position and make full use of it, so I could just be dead. I just want to kill myself. I just want to kill myself",0
"I feel like a husk. I have no thoughts in my head. I have no feelings in my body. I have no hobbies, few friends, and I spend most (if not all) of my time alone, in my apartment, bombarding my brain with mindless nonsense. I feel like I am incapable of making a decision and missing that piece of the human brain that tells people to do things. To plan and to identify how to make things happen.I did not realize that is how I was living, until one day, I did. And when it clicked, I wanted to vomit. All of the time I wasted. All of the people I pushed away. The experiences I never had. And that made me seek help.it is been a couple weeks since then. I have been battling. And today, I had a thought. I have not said this out loud to anyone, so I am putting it here. I think I was emotionally abused.I remember being 12 and having a friend over playing Thrillville on the PS2 and my mom coming home drunk at 2am screaming at me for staying up so late. I remember all the nights that I would hear her and my stepdad come home at 1am, and I would immediately flick the lights off and try to go to bed, because I was afraid of if they would fight or if they would scream at me. I remember being in high school and afraid of having a relationship, just because I would have to tell my mom about it, and I knew she would freak out. I remember the time when I was 17 and she would constantly take my phone and go through it when she drank, and one of my friends sent me a chain text about buying pot from him. I did not even smoke. She called him and screamed at him, and then she screamed at me. I remember being 21 and she slapped me in the face, grabbed my arm as I tried to storm out, and when I yanked my arm out from her grip, she fell and said she was going to call the cops on me, and that they would arrest me because ""I am a man and she is a woman."" I remember being 16 and trying to work up the nerve to go downstairs and get a bowl of cereal, because I was afraid.I feel like my brain shut itself down back when I was a kid. Said that it was going on autopilot, because there was no other way. And I have spent all that time since then alone. In my room. By myself. Doing nothing to better myself. I graduated high school in that time. I graduated college in that time. I became a relatively successful adult (so far, at least professionally) in that time. And yet, I do not know me. I am lost. And I am afraid that it is too late to ever find myself. And that I was taken from me against my will. I think I was emotionally abused.",0
"I will never be good at something. Why?Because to be good at something, you need to like it at least a little bit, enough so you can be motivated to do engage in that activity.But I have no interests. I have spent 2+ years trying like mad to find an interest. Reddit, google, wikipedia etc... I did so much research trying to find at least 1 interest. But my anhedonic brain just does not like anything. And I definitely will not be interested enough in anything to like it enough to the point I spend enough time in it that I become good at it. Anhedonia + depression + ADHD is a hell of a combination. I really want to be good at something, it is one of my biggest wishes to be really good at something. I NEED to be good at something if I am ever to have a good life, especially in this third world country. But it will never happen, because of my anhedonia and lifelong depression.",0

"Sadly nothing's improvingMy DUI case has finally come up (read my post history) after a year ... I show up, they want to have me wear some kind of patches that detect drugs over the course of a year. they are expensive, and I cannot afford them. I am supposed to show up again for everyone to argue this over again in two weeks.This DUI is for an anxiety prescription that I took as instructed, that had an unexpected reaction. I only took it once. If COVID-19 had not happened, I would not have needed the medication.I have been not taking anything for anxiety and have just lived with them several times a day. I was even given a prescription that should not have any of the effects given by previous medication, but I have not. I am too scared to take the chance. I am running through my savings and will likely be homeless. That means this is still going to be on my record for a year and be dismissed. The problem until I can get this dismissed it will still be hard to get a decent job, any job. I have already lost jobs I applied to over this. I will not be able to get this expunged for a year. I feel like everything is conspiring to make me homeless and die on the streets in the near future. it is a sign for me to give up.As I said earlier; I am already the walking dead and I just need help my body to catch up to it.More and more I am thinking it is time. Time for me to leave this life. I am thinking two weeks from now at midnight.I am a failure at life, I wish I could tell everyone I am sorry before I leave.

"When the rose colored glasses come off and you realize those you thought were your closest, most important parts of your social life do not actually care much about you at all. How am I supposed to trust someone is actions as pure and honest when their words are so demeaning and vindictive. I grew up with the mindset that a drunk mans thoughts is a sober ones words, is this applicable to when we are angry? Sure, we all say things we regret after the fact, that are said in the moment but what happens when it is not a one time mistake but a habitual routine? How do you force yourself to move on from these moments and not let your brain play them on repeat. I am still young but still somehow feel so fucking bitter to the point where I daydream about cutting everyone out of my life again and moving somewhere new.

"it is very difficult with so many people in the house. Yet I am certain in my belief that this is the thing to do. I do not want to trudge through a boring meaningless life. I have no friends, everything is really a mundane mess. There are two principle means through which this end goal could be achieved . Either through hanging which I would not do unless I was certain that whatever contraption I had constructed would work in the intended manner, or else driving my car in to a body of water, the nearby river would do the trick.Hanging seems to appeal more to me, the latter seems to be quite a terrifying thing to attempt. Although it would eliminate the chance of chickening out, and if it achieved the same end goal then a few minutes of panicking should not be the dealbreaker.I am a huge loser. The must frustrating thing is that there are small things that could have been changed at 13-14 which would have completely changed the trajectory of this life. I am not depressed, I have just come to the conclusion that the continuation of my life would be a fruitless endeavor and I see no point in continuing as it will just become more and more pathetic. I am 20 years of age and a huge loser.People are always recommending things like Therapy, and some people(on the internet only ,nobody IRL would even suspect I am at this stage) have recommended medication. The problem is, that these things make sense if there is something worth salvaging. Someone can become a complete mess at 20, for several years on drugs for instance, but recover. That is the case if they are built on a firm foundation, there is no foundation and the entire structure is rotten.

I know they can be so harmful and I do not want to deal with it. I also do not have the heart to take my life because I know people close to me will be in shock and I will because so much pain.But living is such a pain, I do not know who to talk about that, I cannot even get up in the morning properly without forcing myself to do so.I hate forcing myself to do stuff, I hate myself, my mind, my body.

I have been consistent with going to work I am just stressed not having the buffer and losing my job if i have a day where i slip back into those super dark places. is she right? is it okay for me to be upset? or am i just silly for even hoping for this, as it is almost a luxury in a sick sort of way. idk, I am just disappointed in myself most of all for even needing the accommodation and feeling kind of embarrassed for even bringing it up.

All I want is to feel comfortable in my skin, to feel like I have actual friends, to be able to handle pressure, bad times and rejection, to not hate who I see in the mirror, to not feel ugly, and to not feel inadequate all the time. How do you stay positive when everything is always hard?",0
The only thing stopping me is the fear of failing... I want to unalive myself,1
"I am a 19 year old man who is spent most of his life with severe anxiety, mental health issues, and depression. For the last five years I have struggled with bulimia and for the past year I have struggled with alcoholism. I have a girlfriend who lives with me and I love her dearly. I am stuck in my self destructive ways even though my life has gotten better. I am off meds, I am no longer locked away in a psych ward, yet I am still attempting to destroy myself subconsciously. If I try to adopt a healthy lifestyle I freak out and revert to my old ways. I drank too much again tonight and binged a ton, purging everything. Now I am laying in bed typing this, emotionless expression on my face. I can barely feel anything anymore yet I am truly afraid, somehow. I just want to get better. Yet, I am struggling to hard. I need help, I think",0
"Just when I think my mental health condition is the worst and it cannot get worse than this somehow things get even messier the next day. I do not even feel the importance of trying to make myself feel better because it does not actually work. In the end of the day I am alone with my depression, my deteriorating mental health, my persistent anxiety. I am losing my interest in everything. I do not talk to my close ones anymore,I do not do things I used to do. Right now I am not looking for ways to feel better because I know there is no point. I cannot..",0
"This community gives good advice, I am 15 and have been depressed for years not told a single person out of a combination of fear and humiliation,my parents are extremely insensitive to metal disorders,4 years ago one of my siblings got diagnosed with it and she got everything taken out of her room except the bed she lost her phone for weeks all for being honest at a doctors appointment.I do not want to reach out to an adult because my family would find out ,technology is one of the few things that keep me sane and that would all be taken, I have considered talking to a friend about it so I am not alone but I do not know how he feels about metal problems and I am worried he would tell somebody and only make it more difficult Suggestions?",0
I am not sure if I have depression but I have this pain in my heart and its not mental pain sometimes it hurts and just ruins my day and I cannot think of any reason why it happens I have asked a lot of people and they do not know I have a question,0
"I feel so lost, so confused with my life right now. I graduated in May and peaked for literally two weeks and fell off so hard. I lost my gym bros who do not even talk to me anymore, lost contact with most people I went to highschool with, and only have less then ten real friends at this point. I have lost motivation to workout and just always feel tired now. I am too scared to ask my parents or my friends for help and I just feel so isolated. I feel like I have nobody, like I am just trapped in a jail cell and cannot escape. Its to the point where I have to ask internet strangers on a burner account for help I just want to be happy man can someone please save me Help",0
"I am a 15 year old boy, and a couple years ago , I started to like a girl. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever met but I was so afraid to tell her how I felt. Up until last august. She said she did not know me well enough but she respected my honesty. She unfortunately passed away in April. One of her friends said she thought I was sweet and genuine, and now I can never prove it to her. I sometimes think about this and feel like there is no point now for me to be here, to stay strongIm not very good looking, at least it definitely appears that way- I have only ever been rejected or let down nicely, and on top of that I get shy around girls I like and I am awkward.I have only ever been average or below at everything, I am not popular or anything, so I do not rlly get invited to like parties or anything , which especially sucks bc its summer- and I usually have to be the one to set up hang outs with my 2-3 friends The only thing really keeping me going is that my 16th birthday is in November and I do not want to miss thatGiven all this, I feel like sometimes I do not want to be here anymore, and that things could never get better and all I really ask for is for someone to tell me its going to be ok or tell me I am wrong in my thinking with reasoning, please? Hurting",1
I feel so hopeless and like a failureI do not know how to put this eloquently so I am just going to say it. This past year I applied to medical school (several different ones) and I got one interview which turned into a waitlist which I am still on. I feel like literally such a failure and I am burnt out and exhausted because I feel like I have worked so hard for four years just for my dreams that I have had for so long to be crushed. Sure I did not have the best grades or best MCAT score but it felt like it should have been enough. Now I am reapplying and I am just so burnt out I cannot even bring myself to work on the application because I feel like I have some sort of PTSD like thing? That just paralyzes me and prevents me from doing anything at all. I am also looking for a job to do for my gap year and it feels hopeless because I have not heard back from anywhere at all. I just feel so sad and hopeless and depressed I do not know what to do. I just recently graduated college and I just feel so lost and I do not know what comes next. I feel like I have nothing going for me and I am scared to even reapply for med school because I do not know if its going to amount to anything I am tired of disappointment,0
"Do you guys know any forums where people discuss suicide freely? I mean if I want to talk about climbing Mount Everest, I do not care about you parroting bullshit that I should not do that, because staying home is safer. Same goes if I want to talk about suicide, I want to actually talk about it and not about your socially acceptable, comforting delusions. So, any websites without the BS? Any forums with freedom of speech?",1
Is anyone else trying to rebound? I am thinking I am facing an end-of-life scenario. there is nothing left I want to do alone and I have failed to meet anyone new. All my old friends are gone. Next 12 months look like the end of the road. A deadend. everyone is plans for the next 12 months?,0
"it is basically a suicide note because I do not really like to write and this way I can just talk freely. I wanted to capture everything so it does not leave anything unanswered I guess. On one of them, where I talk about how much I love my family, I just started crying uncontrollably. I do not know how much strength there is in me but in case I break I want everyone to know what I was going through. I recorded some videos in case I die",0

"Recently split with my girlfriend of 6 years after seeing her make out with a mutual friend of ours one night while we were out.I had a hard enough time dealing with the breakup but two months after we split she asked for our cat Bellamy which we had adopted together. Well after fighting about to cat and who should get to keep it I get flooded with screenshot after screenshot of her and her new boyfriend talking shit about me and all my flaws, how great they are sex life is and how much happier she is with new guy.These txts have been on repeat in my head ever since and I just do not see the point in pushing on, why suffer everyday when relief is just a trigger pull away. Why push on?",1
there is nothing more comforting to know that its coming. I set a date.,1
"Maybe it will not I really do not give a shit either way. I do not see the value in working for a society that gives you so little in return. I am currently on disability and if I could work again, I doubt I would have the ambition I used to. I have not tried getting a job since before the accident in 2015. The system is slowly dying and crumbling and I could not be happier. I used to work a white collar job before my accident but I cannot multi task anymore due to a traumatic brain injury. it is because of a drunk driver I am a she will of what I used to be. I am actually happy that drunken piece of shit died in a separate incident. Just waiting on the collapse ya'lll I am waiting for society to collapse.",0
"I hate myself. I think I have always done that to some extent for multiple reasons.I got help half a year ago and it is already a lot better most of the time. But there is one guy in my group of friends (we are not that close) that manages to trigger that ""you are fucking worthless"" part of me every single time we go out for a drink or something. I do not really know how or why and he definitely does not do it on purpose, but he always says something that puts me into that spiral and I cannot get out for the rest of the night and the entire next day. The same thing happened last night. I went to bed at like 7 am only because I was too tired to think about anything.Now we go out Monday night again and I really do not think I can go. I really want to see my firends but if it means 24 hours of suffering afterwards I do not know if it is worth it.I have considered talking to him about it but 1. I do not think he would understand me at all and 2. The next day everyone he know will probably know what I told him What do I do? I want to go out with friends but I am scared",0
"Been waking up everyday with really no hope, I have been told also that I have syphilis. I do not really want treatment and hope it just kills me. Nobody really wants me around, they just try to make me feel better by pretending to care. I live in a shitty neighborhood where I am constantly living in fear with a bipolar dad that dishes out his criticism and disappointment on me. I am worn out, like before I was working out and working, but it hit me. What am I doing this for if I have nothing to really cherish anyway? I am always thinking about others but I am always getting the back end of shit. I am fucking exhausted, I am tired of not being able to hold a job, because I cannot get along with anyone. I am tired of being ignored in situations where I am trying to excel. I am tired of being disrespected. I am tired of feeling so anxious to even be apart of society. I am tired of thinking there is a future for me when in realty I am so fucked I am better off dead. I get shitted on everyday for who I am, how am I suppose to be happy at all? I am tired of searching through these fucking hook up apps just to find some damn friends. I am fucking tired. Had my 26th birthday on the 26th, and did not really celebrate life is so dull now.",1
I cannot take the pain anymore Leaving makes more sense,1
"Life just does not seem to be for me. I am a waste of space, 29 Yeats old, still live with parents, left school at 15, no qualifications, live in the middle of no where. I just spent the whole of last week in bed, missing doctors &amp; counselling appointments. I have no prospects for the future because I did not think Id live that long. My birthday was a few days ago &amp; I got a total of 3 Happy Birthdays: 2 from my parents (only because I live with them) the other was a friend I have know for 15+ years &amp; only remembered because I reminded him. Where were the rest of my friends? Not just for my birthday but where is everyone?there is positives over the past year, I quit drinking &amp; now I am 6 months sober &amp; I do not even know why I am anymore. I am fully aware of what it was like having a drinking problem but at least I was not as suicidal as I am now. The same can be said for my heroin usage (was not addicted just enjoyed it).I do not know what to do with myself &amp; I do not even know why I am writing this if all I am going to get back is you have so much to live for, think of your family, your friends would miss you blah blah blah. Its like hearing people read off a script then my Dr will suggest group therapy. I am sorry but sitting around in a circle talking about how all messed up we are does not help me, it just makes me worse because these folk seem like legitimate reasons to be suicidal whereas I do not.I just seem to drift through life, no talents to speak of &amp; nothing worth living forFor goodness sake I even have my own suicide kit made up that is hidden in my room with enough drugs to depress the central nervous system &amp; make breathing more difficult &amp; a slipknot already tied just incase in too high at the time to tie it then Ill wrap it around my neck &amp; say goodbye to this pathetic life &amp; existence.

So for the past 3 years I have been selfharm free I have never had the urge to cut or anything not even do anything dangerous to myself. But recently 4 months ago i developed depersonalization disorder it is horrible since then I have started selfharming again just because nothing feels real i have no friends and just no one cares about me anymore. Ever since i turned 17 everyone has just left me to be an adult pretty much now i just do not feel ready. I have not even had a hug in 5 years let alone hang out with someone. If I am being quite honest here. I am thinking about taking my own life.My mental health has decreased massively especially with all the restrictions and constant reminders to wear masks and keep safe is just driving me insane. I am sorry Started Cutting Again,1
"It seems stupid to most people I am guessing, but I just removed all of my piercings and flushed them down the toilet. They gave me a sense of being more feminine.I think I am going to buzz my hair again, because it looks like shit anyways due to male pattern baldness. I am going to start getting rid of more of my furniture and give away some of the expensive things I bought. Maybe someone else enjoy them. I gave away my nice baking stuff already, and my GoPros. I just put stuff in the hallway with a free sign and its gone. I smashed my oled tv already, and my computer monitor. I need to figure out how I can get rid of the those now, I do not think I can just throw it in the trash.I have a date this Saturday that I want to bail on, but I am still going to go. I need to stop trying to meet people, its not like I can use someone else to try to be happier anyways. I always hear that you need to love yourself first before someone else will love you anyways. I kind of hope the date goes poorly, or she says she is not interested in seeing me more. That will really motivate me to take care of this problem I have.I do not think I am going to leave a note. I have written some before but there is nothing much to say.I think the nice thing about having epilepsy is that I do not have to OD on anything, I can just stop taking my medication and my body will take care of the rest.

"I have ate slept and breathed this man for 2 years and 3 days. I have given him every ounce of me I could give him.I have tried to make his life better, tried to love him through his dark days and amplify his bright days.My stepdad and his wife drove 8 hours to visit with us today, they were a couple hours later than expected and as a result it threw off our schedule.He is so upset with me he lost it. How he cannot stand being around other people how he does not want to go out to eat with anyone, does not want them here (he is never met her and only met him 2 or 3 times so it is not like there is bad blood, he just does not like being around people). I have zero friends, zero other family, it is he and I 364 days a year.He told me we were not compatible and I needed to pack my things and leave because I made plans to go out to eat.Everything in my life is going wrong, this is just the cherry on top I guess...I am laying in bed with a gun to my side and trying to decide whether to do it here or load up and find someplace I can see the sunset one last time...That man was my reason to live. 2 years.. 2 years and he is done with me.",1

"CW: religion/spirits, bad thoughts So I have been having a rough time lately. Feeling like ending it all. Like, all the time. Its so miserable. I constantly have migraines and stomach aches just from the sheer depression and anxiety. So I always try to tell myself different reasons why I should not. One of my major reasons &amp; thoughts lately have been if my spirit would stay stuck feeling that way forever? do not know anyone elses religious beliefs but raised a Christian ofcourse were taught we will not go to heaven if we end our own lives. And I have had such bad days with terrible migraines and body aches and depression and it makes me want to put a bullet in my head. But then I think, if I kill myself now, will I suffer from migraines and depression for the rest of eternity? (Provided the religious beliefs are indeed true). I really just wanted to find out other peoples opinions on this? If you are religious at all have you thought about this? Please lemme know. Suffering for eternity?",1
"My ex and I broker up after 3 years a few months back. I tried desperately to get her back after realizing i really did still love her. It failed and she is done and she has our cat we got together. I still love them dearly and I know ill probably never see them again. I finally got the courage to go through my phone and try to erase the photos of the cat. I just cannot do it. I have spent an hour going through the gallery and snap chat. I have just set them to hidden. It hurts far too much. I have been suffering through depression after realizing what I had let go, what I had lost. My little family. These photos are almost the last moments and belongings I have left of them. I am trying so hard to heal, but it hurts thinking ill need to forget our kitten.Does anyone else have any of advice for this? It really reopened a wound that was starting to heal.

I really need a new one. Honestly I probably need to go to a treatment program but I cannot even validate that for myself and there is no one to force me so. Its just so much to find the right one and god the phone calls. I cannot do the phone calls. I so wish I had a parent who would call for me n but that is just not my life : (. I also have a billion other phone calls I have been needing to make for weeks about other medical stuff but I just have not gotten thereIm doing really bad my meds stopped working two months ago and I quit my job and my mood is a rollercoaster throughout the day even though I do nothing but sit in my room. But does it matter. I do not even want to be happy. I am just fishing around for validation and attention. I cannot find the want for me to be happy in me so I search and hope for it in someone else.

"Everyone has their ups and downs. Everyone goes though good and bad days however I had realized that I am missing something more. I have been feeling like even though I am told that I am heard, it feels like quite the opposite. I have been feeling misunderstood for as long as I remember and its catching up to me. I almost have no communication with my parents, all of my friends are busy with life and my girlfriend of 2 years just left me a couple of days ago because I exhausted her which is true and I need to find myself and I have to settle things with me. I have been lacking motivation for the past few years, there is nothing that I feel inspired by, nothing that drives me and I feel like I am just another person that awaits his time to go.

I am in my early thirties. But I have had chronic suicidal ideation since age 14. I remember the first time as if it were yesterday. Part of me is proud I made it to 33. But I do not think I am going to last much longer. I feel weak for giving into the negative thoughts. But I just do not think I can keep up the facade anymore. I have high functioning ASD (Aspergers) and trying to fit in and form relationships has just grown far too exhausting. Wish you all the best in this subreddit. Reading many posts over the last month has given me some hope and inspiration. In knowing I am not alone with these struggles. You made an impact on me. Thank you. I can feel it coming.,1

Everyday of my life I always overthink to the point where I feel like my brain has a malfunction. I do not have an ID, driver license, or job yet. I would wish I had at least one person irl to hang out with my age. Also a lot of the time I always dream about being in a relationship with a girl. I am starting to feel like life is not real.

"It has been a long time since I have come here and I saw it as a good thing. Things have been getting better and better and then they just stop.

"Please let me preface this by saying I am not trying to insult anyone or flex or brag and I am very aware a lot of people are less fortunate than me. I work 3 jobs, 7 days a week, 60 or so hours a week. I pull in. $2400 a month sometimes up to $3000 and have done so for the last year. My monthly expenses come to about $1700 a month and yet I never have more that $300 or so in my account unless I plan on buying something big. Last year it was $1200 on flight sim controls I think I have used like 10 times since I bought them. I have slowly added more pieces to a drum kit I can hardly play, I just rebuilt a new computer two months ago, and last week I bought a 3D printer to make DnD minis. It was not until two days ago when I started looking for a bigger new computer case for my just built rig that I realized that I am just spending money to buy stuff I do not need.I think I am doing this because I constantly feel lonely. No significant other and I do not really socialize outside of work. Does anyone else spend money on expensive things like this? Again sorry if it sounds like I am bragging. Spending money to fill the hole??",0

"I have been badly depressed my whole life. Or at least gloomy. My parents were always nicer and favored my sister. They were usually more attentive and lenient to her. Her life has gone pretty well while my life has genuinely has nothing going for it.I was not a good student, i got into a community college and had to drop out due to injury. I have always had bad legs, my knees always buckled and my feet do not point straight and it always made it hard to walk. Since i was little. it is led to my falling a lot and having resulting injuries. 2 dislocations, a broken ankle and i broke my kneecap. The last injury was horrific, i had to drop out of college, walk in braces for over a year, 3 surgeries, wheelchairs and walkers. I am a burden on my family with all my health problems. I do not have insurance and have no money.I have always had weight problems. I suffer from obesity, always have been since i was 8. I know what and what not to eat, but nobody to push me to do it. I give in to bad food more often then i like to admit. I cannot make myself stick to diet. And i cannot exercise because of the disabilities, i also just do not have the drive. I cannot even stand for 10 minutes wihtout getting fatigued. I want to but i cannot push myself to do it. I feel myself getting bigger, i thought i could finally exercise when my family got a pool but i cannot get in. it is just above my hip and i cannot get in, I am scared to death of ladders, i cannot step over the side. I really want in but i cannot. I think my years of being obese are starting to catch up to me, I would guess i probably do not have much time left anyway.On top of the weight are a myriad of other health problems I have been stuck with. I am not body confident because every man in the family is taller then me. they are all tall and I am way shorter, i even have small hands and feet. I feel like i have a kid's body. they are all multi talented, while i just cannot physically do anything. I cannot play sports, i cannot sing, i cannot dance or anything. The only thing going for me is that i know really random trivia from years of watching quiz shows.I cannot work so i live with my mom. I literally stay in bed all day. Sleeping, screwing around online and watching anime.I am also getting lonely, i have no friends, i talk to nobody. I have never hung out with a friend or texted a person. I also am still a virgin. I honestly do wish i could experience a relationship one time before i go. it is what I will regret most. But i knew it would not happen due to my looks in general, and my complete lack of social skills.I finally found a community that accepted me. r/waifuism, i have a waifu, since i was a kid i had a crush on a female anime character, i knew a real relationship was not going to be a part of my life, so i embraced the waifuism. 6 months I have been posting on there and they banned me out of nowhere. That was a heavy blow, for months I have regularly been contributing to this page and it was the closest i had to real friends and i suddenly got banned.I cannot stick to anything. Even simple things like writing fanfiction or making YouTube videos. I have had stories I have posted a chapter to on hold for years. I regret doing that, i do not even have an excuse, i just quit. I have 0 drive to do anything. I do not even know what I would want to do if i could work. I have thought about becoming a VA but i do not have the drive. it is my dream, since I have always liked cartoons. I know I will regret that and not finishing the fanfic's. But that is it. The closest thing for me is that i want to meet my idol, a woman who I have been a fan of for years and who voiced some of my favorite anime characters. She left an impact on my childhood, I would want to meet her and thank her for that.The only thing that is really stopping me is my grandmother. I love her to death and losing me would completely devastate her. She already lost 1 son, he died of cancer a few years back. A lifetime of loneliness and health problems, along with just having nothing to live for.",1
"I have made my mind up I am doing this, I do not know hot to say goodbye tho and I do not want to hurt people I feel like I am being so selfish but I just cannot keep living anymore its too much how do I say goodbye I am done",1
I am 25 years old and I feel like a 60 year old man. The world I was born into no longer exists. All the technology I grew up with is dead and outdated. Major staples of my childhood like renting movies and phone calls are now gone and replaced with something strange. The people I went to high school with may as well be dead and buried considering the last time I have spoken to one of them. But I am still here. I feel like I should be gone too. A relic of a bygone era. I got left behind,0
"Am I depressed if I feel really lonely all the time? I am just not sure. I do not get out much being a stay at home mom, trying to keep distance from others for the sake of my son's health as he is too young to get vaccinated. When my husband is not working that is all he wants to do is play games. I know I signed up to be a gamers wife and it usually does not bother me but I just feel so alone. Yeah I am with my son 24/7 but he is a yr old. I have never really had friends to talk to, the only ones I have really clicked with moved away. I am 1500 miles from my entire family so I really have no one besides my husband and kid. I just cannot help but feel lonely, does that make me depressed? Is that just the circumstances? I do not know. I just know I feel alone. Am I?",0
 Sick of people who moan about trivial shit and get support whilst I have had the worst year of my life and get nothing at all.,0
"I have been doing so well with treating my anxiety and poor body image, I am in counselling, I have supportive friends. I feel so selfish for feeling like this. I feel like I am disrespecting and making a mockery of people who have killed themselves because I know if I worked at it I could make this horrid feeling go away. But I am just so tired. Mentally I am completely exhausted. My mum was just diagnosed with yet another serious disease and because her immune system is already weak as hell from her medication it could be potentially fatal. My dad blames her 'bad lifestyle' for it so they are constantly screaming at each other -- they both want a divorce, but cannot afford one. I am so sick of trying to block out the arguing and I do not know what to do anymore. I am probably going to die young anyway because the disease is hereditary and every single female in my mum's bloodline has gotten some form of it. Yeah, I could take medication for the rest of my life, but is it worth it? there is nothing even wrong with me. I got good grades in my mock exams (I am 15 and in secondary school), I have such nice friends but all they seem to do is annoy me now. I know they do not mean to. it is my fault. I am doing stupid shit I never would have done a month ago like taking more painkillers than necessary and walking out of lessons to hide in the toilets until the end of the day. For reference, this time last month I had severe anxiety and would not even speak in lessons. Now I am leaving them without asking and snapping when I do not get my way. I even fucking told a teacher yesterday that I felt like hurting myself, that I felt suicidal, and I had to sit in her office while she called my mum and put the phone on speaker so I heard what she had to say about it. I have stopped looking both ways before I cross the road, stopped caring about what other people think about me, started shutting out everybody who cares, and when I get home I just cry. that is it. Cry and sleep. it is so absurd to me because I read what I am writing and I sound pathetic -- so many people do worse things than this and I feel so wrong for wanting to die but I am just done. I do not know what to do anymore. Anyhow I have one last day of school left before the summer holidays which is 6 weeks long in the UK so that is 6 weeks to do nothing but sit alone and think. My counsellor's calling me after school but I think I might just ignore it. I think I might overdose this summer. it is probably a temporary feeling that will be gone in a few days but I just needed to get it all out y'know? That way if I do end up offing myself in at least my parents will have some idea of what I was feeling when they look through my phone. I am just tired. Scared. I think. Does anyone know how much paracetamol is considered an overdose? it will deter me if suddenly this seems more real. This summer I might end it all",1
"I am in my early 20s, it seems like all people around me are extremely happy, have a functional family, a solid economic floor, great friends, a ideal relationship and they are living life like a fantasy. Why those people are happy and they have stability in all aspects of life?My soul at this age is consumed literally... I do not have social life since 7 years and get used to stay alone long periods of time in my room, the weirdest part is that I reached such level that I do not use my voice anymore, I prefer communicate in my own house with signs (silence pact).I spend 6-8 hours everyday studying until burnout because I am pissed off, I will not stop until complete my goal because this is the only thing that root me in the real world. My rage and deception of life is such deep that I suppressed my emotions years ago, I converted my depression into pure angry 24/7, it is my only gasoline to continue my day forcing my brain to collapse to get a decent job and leave this hell called ""home"". The problem now is that I am very furious and I contain all of this without leaving my mind, I would like to punch a sand bag to reduce my stress.Right now you are reading this and you could see me but I am not here, my mind left me years ago, one day maybe Ill return when the things be better... for now I have to continue in this automatic strict routine. I would like to have friends to feel something but idk... I became a cold/serious person. Today I make 7 years with depression, try me bi*ch.",0
"I have not genuinely smiled in a long time and nowadays its becoming more of a chore to fake one. I have lost all my appetite and feel like vomiting when I take a few bites, even when I am starving. I feel no joy in life and no hope for the future. Colours have lost their vibrancy making everything in life darker. I know nothing changed but my outlooks become dark and I cannot change it back to how I used to see the world. I have a few friends who I hang with from time to time but feel no enjoyment with them at all. My real friends are all over the world and Ill probably never see them again in my life. I cannot talk to anyone about how I am feeling because those friends do not really care and my supposed family does not do much talking. Most days I try to ignore how I am feeling but lately I cannot anymore. I cannot even be bothered to fake being normal anymore. I wake up only to sleep and nothing more. I am finding it hard to put everything to words because this is a first for me. If you have come this far, thank you for reading my rant and I hope your day was better than mine I do not know what to do anymore",0
"4 years ago I dropped 70 pounds by starving myself in relation to a depression and medication induced lack of appetite. When I saw the weight start to come off, I just kept it going. Very unhealthy way to do it, but I felt satisfied with myself for the first time ever. But over the last 3 years the weight has gradually started to come back with various influencing factors. Every time I have started the process to attempt to get healthy in a safe way, inevitably a new depressive episode hits and my ability to do simple tasks tanks and I am left in survival mode and not caring about what or how much I put into my body. I fear going home. I fear going back to school this semester for the simple reason that my primary instructor felt the need to point out my weight a few weeks ago. Now, I have not gained all of it back, but definitely a significant portion. And yet, why is that her business? Why should she point it out as if it had any bearing on my scholastic ability?Anyways, I guess I just wanted to get this out. I am finally in a decent place mentally after tanking in January. I have caught up on very old dishes, did my laundry, and generally cleaned, and decluttered my apartment. I have been grocery shopping and meal prepping for the past week and making commitments to physical activity by investing in equipment for my home and taking Karate lessons.I feel like I can do it, but I am impatient and the anxiety of the realistic timeline for results against the timeline for the return to university has me second guessing every moment. But every moment I keep choosing to take care of myself even if it does not show to anyone else. yet. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I hope you are taking care of yourselves and screw those around you who are unsupportive of your health and well-being. Which is worse: physical weight or weight of spirt?",0
"I was diagnosed with depression a long while ago, with that term chemical imbalance thrown around a lot too. I only really experienced exactly what this meant this summer.While trying to make some life improvements I had decided to try multivitamins as my diet has been lacking for a long while on account of not being able to afford better meals or many of them, often i was having only one meal a day of either a microwave meal or noodles. After taking the multivitamins I experienced a severe wave of depression, more intense than when i had first been diagnosed. I am wondering if anyone else has ever had a similar experience or can advise me of anything on how to avoid reoccurrences or further complications in the future. (PS I stopped taking the vitamins immediately after feeling this way. It took around 3 days to kick in but nearly 2 weeks to wear off.) What is chemical imbalance depression?",0
"I am 24 now and I am still the same piece of shit I was 10 years ago. I started cutting when I was 12. My arms, my legs, my stomach. I constantly have to make sure that no one sees them. I tried to kill myself when I was 13. Everyday I wake up and look at my arm. it is still visible. It fucks me over. Day after day, after day. I can remember it all so clearly, it is a constant nightmare. It hurts to relive it every single day. The pain is still there and never left. I wish I would have never started to cut, it is just a daily reminder that I am too weak to kill myself. I still see my scars from 10 years ago",1
If i have luck like last time i will be fine the next day. But i would be fine with dying at this point my body survived to much shit already. If my life ends it ends. So i took a bunch of pills,1
"I certainly do not feel happy. But this odd mix of feeling alone, snappy, pissed at myself for my life's mistakes and my parents are not helping either. When i tell my dad to stop yelling at me, he just yells harder. When I tell him why am i doing this wrong, he just straight up smacks me. And what am i getting wrong? Math. Whenever i tell him to shut up because his yelling is not helping me think, he smacks me. Heck, there was a period of time where i was scared to be around him because I thought he might snap and kill me. I was 7 back then. He has given me death threats, threatened me with belts, threatened to stop my education and whatnot.And no, I am not calling the cops because apart from him and mum (I am under 18), I have no where else to go really, especially in these times. I just do not know how i feel",0
A few moments of happiness are not worth all the suffering in the long run. Some days are good overall but most of the time they are not. It is just not worth it to go through all that shit only to get a little bit of happiness if any at all. No amount of happiness will ever be worth it. it is just not worth it,1
"people always tell me why i do not show any happiness or emotion when i accomplish something (specially in ice skating) so i was thinking about it and now i know why i just cannot, why i cannot be able to show itwhen i was younger every time i got excited my family invalidated my accomplishments, yeah maybe joking or something else but at the moment it hurt so i unconditionally stopped telling my accomplishments and stopped getting that excited so now i just cannot feel the excitement just i got the work done, i did what i was supposed to and of course i feel satisfaction by it but i just cannot get happy for me so I am SORRY if anyone can relate to this because its kind of sad honestly, because all the excitement i get is from someone elses accomplishments and i show them how happy I am from them cannot show happiness",0

Why do I get hurt at the littlest things? Like if my bf goes to play games with his bsf and his gf why do I get so upset? I was doing so good too i started eating again and everything then this happens again. Now I am crying all the time like before and it got even harder to hide. Why I am I so sensitive abt the things people in my life do? My depression was almost gone I worked so hard now I am back at square 1 why did this happen again? How do I stop being sensitive? I do not know what is wrong anymore,0
i do not know what to do or where to go i want to kill myself so fucking bad i spent so much time and energy trying to follow the things i was told to do by mental health professionals and the only time i felt any semblance of relief was in my dreams since my mental illness makes it almost impossible to distinguish them from reality and for a second i am able to believe i am actually killing myself i stopped eating the way I am supposed to and working out and taking my medication and doing therapy for about two or three weeks now and i honestly do not know how to proceed from here i reallt want to kill myself but I am so scared of dealing with the consequences of surviving a suicide attempt i rlly wish i could own a gun so i could just blow my brains out and i feel so bad posting shur like this but i do not have any friends anymore i have not talked to anyone in about three months i just want to kill my self i just want to be okay,1
"I would rather be depressed miserable, pessimist, whatever else people enjoy labelling me as; and be real with everyone all year round; than literally just exude fake happiness which just exposes people's clear insecurities.People would rather walk around with a plastered smile that looks so forced and energy depleting rather than wait and be disciplined for the real and genuine smile when you meet with something, a person a situation that makes you really happy.What is the point in trying to *convince others* of your apparent so called 'happiness' 'higher frequency' bullshit when all it does is make others feel bad and guilty for their depression and difficult times in their lives?I am not saying you should not strive for it and *obviously* faking happiness can be a good way to get there. But I actually think real problem solving in your life is the only way to find true happiness. Faking it is just away to avoid the real issues in your life that are not changing. Maybe start with that before enforcing your toxic positivity rules onto others. I am talking to you twitter. Genuine happy is better than fake happy",0

The more I think about it the more I want it. The more logical it seems. The more it seems like the right thing to do. The only thing to do. I will never be happy and I cannot have what I want most. Death is my best option. I do not want to compromise my happiness. Fuck that. The more I think.,1
"i.e. not having friends, not going a lot of places, not having many hobbiesSeems like more of a concern for the other people in my life than it is for me. I am happy just to be able to wake up in the morning and perform basic functions and go to work and shit. I do not need to thrive. I have already exceeded my own expectations of where I thought I was going to be at age 23. Just the fact that I have not offed myself feels like a massive accomplishment, and yet people who have not been clinically diagnosed with any mental illness feel like it is their place to tell me how to live my life. It fucks me off, quite honestly. Just leave me alone. If I was going to do something to myself I would have done it by now. You do not have to be so goddamn worried.

While you, on the other hand already know that you do not have to be a dick and abuse substance to do through shit to prove to yourself that you can change.

I cannot sleep for more then 5 hours, I end up waking and not being able to fall back asleep.I feel constantly angry, if I wanted to make myself smash something I would, but I still have morals so I do not.

I need to know if i should seek help or if what i am experiencing is not due to depression",0
"Fuck I wish I was not so much of a damn coward about it, so many times I wish I could get it over with.Just do not really want to put my mom through that, also do not want to risk my school loans being dumped on her--do not entirely trust that my own death would be the end of it.I always chastise myself about feeling like this, that my stupid issues are not anything compared to the suffering many go through.Yet that logic goes out the window when stress causes my anxiety to feel like it is ripping and clawing at my throat. That for everything I try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another, like a constant reminder that I am always going to be worthless, that it is the punishment I deserve for even being born.That it is my own fault for even trying in the first place. Or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so I could push myself to just fucking do better. I mean why should I care if I ruin my body now? I barely expected myself to make it this far, to live this long. I mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point I imagine. Constant reminders of failure and uselessness ramming against the dam will because it to shatter at some point. A meaningless existence like mine is surely destined to fizzle out soon enough. I just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has been.How nice it would be to just pop away, to erase my debts and traces of my life as if I was never here to begin with. I know so many people fear the very idea of the end. But at this point I am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming. I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me. But until then I guess I will just have to stick to dreaming. A mistake of a life",1

"I have always been an introvert, I rarely do something for getting noticed from people, I just mind my own businesses and nothing else, but in the last times I have been pretty depressed.

Toxic as in need a psych ward. I lash out at everyone and everything. Then go on an endless spiral of guilt when they forgive me. Repeat cycle. it is always one or the other excuse. I am hungry. Sleep deprived. On my period. It has become so bad that people feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me and the relationships they keep with me are mostly superficial. Leads to loneliness. It never ends. I can never erase the image they have of me in their mind. The drama queen is who I am. Congrats anxiety you have got it right. I want to die. I am the toxic person everyone warns you about.,1
"For a long time I have just been saying I am absolutely worthless, and I cannot remember the reasoning as to why I am doing this. This has been going on for 10+ years. I always find someway to bring myself down for no reason. I disconnect myself from people when they are nice to me, just saying that they are faking it, that I am not worth their time. Beating myself up is the only time I truly feel anything anymore. I put others before me and make sure they are happy even if it makes me more depressed. I just want to quit all the time. I also think this way of thinking makes me weak which brings me back to berating myself with insults. Why do I do this to myself",0

"i just cannot do it anymore. i do not want to live i just want to fade away but I am too much of a coward to do anything. I am a bastard, my biological father was never in my life. he never reached out or even tried to talk to me. i found out that in the December of 2019 that he has had other families and kids after me even though I am his first son and child. I have never even seen his face but i still want to have this man in front of me. not as a father, a person too talk to, or even just for clarity. no, i want him in front of me so i can finally put all my anger, depression, and anxiety that hes given me into punches, kicks, and slaps that will bring the world to an end. i hate this man with every cell of my being, and i always will. he was nothing but a drunk that would abuse and manipulate my mother while i was still in her womb. i still have very subtle but still somewhat noticeable deformities from this, like how an eye is above the other or how i have a dent in the back of my head. when i was younger we moved at least once a year to a different state. i could never make any friends because i would just leave them in a couple months. i felt alienated from everyone mentally at just 4. only person i could really connect to was and still is my mom. finally in 2010 we stopped moving around and lived in this blue complex. we lived on the middle floor while we had neighbors downstairs and upstairs. then in September my little brother was born. apparently something happened to him and this lead to him being underdeveloped mentally. this led to things like him almost dying multiple times. he did not even officially learn how to read properly until the third grade. in 2011 though, we had to move out just as things were somewhat getting comfortable. apparently a company in the nearby area had bought the land and area from the owner and they were kicking us out. luckily though we found a home a few months later. and we have been living here ever since. as i got a little bit older i started to be depressed by thoughts of my father and things i can never mention to anyone until i am very comfortable presenting them. this resulted in me having to go to the counselors office every week in 5th grade and having to act happy every grade after that. as time went on i started to lash out at people and started to develop anger issues that would and still result in me yelling, screaming, punching, and throwing things. i joined the wrestling team in 2019 during the beginning of 8th grade but i quite it this January because of how unhappy i am with myself. i would always go into weightlifting, practice, and tournaments thinking and having the mentality that i can achieve whatever i want and that things get better. sadly though i always left those events with the mindset that I am a worthless fat pig that cannot even run 5 minutes without whining. i did everything i could to the point where i would go in there and just yell at myself every time i waned to stop and give up. i would sit there stone faced pushing myself trying to prove myself worthy to my own mind and conscious. in the end though, that did not help at all because all i could see in the mirror was a fat kid that is considered a failure of a student, a failure of a athlete, a failure of a friend, a failure of son, and a failure of a human being. things did not get better after i quite though as those thoughts only got more powerful seeing as how i quite a sport after a year just because of my own mentality and thoughts. i started to become somewhat of shut in. i gained almost all of the weight that i lost back. i have been kind of skimming and passing through the days after that because nothing matters much anymore. especially seeing as how last month i was hit with the bombshell that my mother might be diagnosed with cancer and probably has it. i was not always a good son, but this is too much. i cannot have anything properly in this world in which i do not want to live in the first pace. my depression and anxiety have all be undermined or put to the side by others to the point that i do not even talk to my friends or family as much as i used to anymore unless i have to. whenever i try and improve my life either by exercise or anything else, it always gets taken away from me or i just run my own self into the ground mentally because i cannot see myself as nothing but a fat, worthless, unlovable, idiot who was not even loved enough to have seen his own biological father. i cannot and do not want to go on with this life, but I am too much of a wimp to do anything. i even tried running away but my weakness got the better of me and i returned hours later. why does it have to be me that has been dealt this hand. i want to die but i cannot do anything. i do not want to go on. I have had 15 yrs of life and do not want anymore",0
"I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts/ideations since I was 10, now in my late 20's. I have not been able to keep a relationship going for man than 3 months and the reason for that is definitely my depression. I believe whoever I am dating at the time is blind sided by One of my episodes. I cannot blame them for wanting out haha I want out of my head too!With that little bit of context I wanted to ask how others have approached telling your SO about your depression. How much did you tell them and did you tell them at the start or wait?The biggest issue I see with telling someone early is dumping too much at once (trauma dumping) which puts them in an uncomfortable position. Telling them later you risk them finding out the not so fun way.Any thoughts appreciated. This is a throw away account btw, idk if mods care or not. When starting a relationship is being upfront about your depression healthier or is pretending?",0

What do you think the easiest way to do it is? Without your raw human survival Instincts to counter it? Cutting your wrists and throat I feel like can back forever a gun pulling away at the last second. How many pills and what kind would you need? Do you need to mix the pills with alcohol? How strong of a rope is needed to hang? How small of a room do you need by sticking your head in the oven?

"I know no one is going to read this but I do not have anywhere else to write.November will be the month I end it finally. it will be after my mom's birthday where I can celebrate with her and spend my final time with her. I want to tell her how much I love her and try my best to say without explicitly saying it, that it was not her fault. That she is always been a good mom to me and that I would not have wanted it any other way. The best mom a son could ever ask for.I always liked November. it is the transition from fall to winter and the air is so cool and nice. it is my favorite time of year, right before everyone goes into Christmas frenzy where everything is decorated red and green and Frank Sinatra is blasted on the radio.Some people are just meant to take their own lives. I wish it was not so taboo. I wish it was not seen as selfish, but it hurts to keep living. Maybe I will drive down to Florida and see the ocean one more time before then. it is been forever seen I have seen the ocean and I miss it a lot. we would go every summer as kids all crammed into that old blue minivan.

"I have always been prone to catastrophizing and only ever anticipating the worst. Last year, I had attempted suicide and wound up in a coma for two days. But lately, I have been feeling like I cannot understand why I would do that. I am excited about where life can take me and when I deal with something tough I feel this trust that it will resolve itself. I have been raised within a fundamental Christian household and been taught that only people with faith can achieve such a mindset and religion has always made me unhappy and that inadvertently felt guilt for that. I was in an unhealthy relationship back then and I felt like I really did not know who I was outside of that relationship. I have always wanted that mans validation and he dumped I remember hurting but since that relationship ended I have been making connections that have made me feel whole and I have come to accept that people come and go and I am completely okay with that. It felt like the past years have been completely traumatic and strangely enough I have been thinking about changing my name because I feel like my birth name is loaded with so much trauma I want treat that person like its someone else. I have been feeling this way more recently, I do not want my trauma to influence my decision, I just want to experience life as a new person. Is it optimism or denial",0

"Hi, so usually i come back to this subreddit when shit hits the fan, and I cannot handle it anymore. I do not really know how to start with these, it is always difficult especially with all the emotion and pain, but I guess I will, start with what is bothering me right now. I had this girlfriend in 2017 and I deeply regret how things ended with her and I, I also regret ending it, because i did it thinking that I had no love for her and that I was only in the relationship for the sex. What I learnt though (this was in early 2018 with therapy) was that I had intrusive thoughts, what had happened was that this thought of not loving her had popped up in my head at some point, and I could not stop thinking about it while in the relationship with her. It was horrible I felt as if I was lying to her throughout the relationship. it is like having a person on your shoulder shouting liar every moment, my only peace was away from her. I saw the only way out was to say ""I do not love you anymore"". I was 19 at the time and so was she, so we were both young, but I hate myself still to this day for doing that and not maybe discussing it first with someone. She was my first love, how we met was pretty magical, we were sitting across from one another and I started to sing one her favourite band songs, and she looked at me and we both began discussing our favourite bands and interests. I knew in that instance that I was attracted to her without a doubt and i think she was as well. The worst part I think about that breakup was that I had no one at varsity to talk to anymore, I was alone with all those thoughts and I started hating the world even more, nearly as much as I hated myself. I think that was the worst moment in my life, worse than anything else. Because I felt like a monster for hurting someone I loved, something I thought I would not do. I wish I could kill myself, I wish I could plunge a knife into my neck and bleed out until i pass out, until I am nothing with no thoughts, just a fucking corpse. Maybe then everything will be calm and I would not have to worry about making mistakes like that again. I am too much of coward anyway, i do not like pain. This all started because of old voice note that might have been her. Funny. Sorry about the violent imagery. I just wanted to talk. Just talking.",1

"I want to start by saying I do not have clinical depression. Everything is just falling apart, and I cannot handle it. My situation is fucking screwed, and when I try to make it better, it seems I only make it worse.I want to die, really. I have wanted to end it all for years, but have been holding on to one thing after the next. Now, I have got a daughter I am trying to be there for. she is the only thing keeping me here at this point.I am in denial about things, and I am like aware of it, but I feel like it is worth being in denial. it is not like I cannot handle the alternative, but I just do not want it. I know that if it comes to it, I will just keep on going, but God damn do I want this.You know, the worst part is I finally set myself up for therapy when I finally hit rock bottom. I am still at rock bottom, but since that day I put in the paperwork/application(last Thursday, today is Wednesday), it can take up to 3 weeks to even get the clinician. I cannot handle what is going on in my head for another two weeks, and then wait to even meet the person, and get fucking help.I started whipping myself with a belt again, which I had not done since 2018. This time, I upgraded to the buckle. My back is incredibly bruised, and sore. But I like looking at it, and I like feeling it in the moment. It makes me feel clear, and like I am being punished for all the fuck ups. I feel like I deserve it. I tried to earlier, but got stopped, because I said something I should not have because I was not thinking.And I am so fucking selfish. Since shit hit the fan, I have been focused on myself instead of what happened(which was to someone else).. But they do not want to talk to me about it, so I am stuck. I ask questions about things that have a concern to me. But this person is the only person I can even ask! I cannot ask someone who does not understand the situation, and I cannot ask the person who does, so what do I do with these feelings and concerns? The only thing I can think of is just punishing myself for even feeling.Fuck, if I could I would go right now and beat the shit out of myself. I am perpetually fucking up. I try to work on things, and then continue to make things worse. I feel like a bull in a China shop, but the bull keeps trying to put the broken plates back on the shelves.

I give, give, and give. I have no more to give. I am tired of helping everyone, I am tired of talking, I am tired of taking care of things. I am tired of not being heard. I am tired of talking to only be seen as every word that comes out of my mouth as insignificant or because others prioritize their wants and cannot handle the mere idea of listening, respecting, or considering my desires and instead treat every word out of my mouth as argumentative. My kid is now one, even when I talk about things about him that Id like, I am told to just put my wants aside and let __ do this, and told to even apologize for things I say with a calm demeanor that I feel adamant about. No one cares about anything that I think, how I feel, what my responsibilities are, or what I contribute when all I do is support my wife, my son, my family, those close to me, and those at work.

Just weeks before the worst of my depression, Id reached out to a singer-friend of mine to do a song with her. When the worst part of my depression hit, all of that was taken away. I lost motivation in my music goals, I lost touch with my singer friend, etc. But the other day I finally wrote lyrics about depression. I am not passionate about this idea at all, but hey, its something, I guess. let us see how many days it takes to work up the motivation to talk to the singer again.

I do not even attempt to play games, use my computer, or any of my projects. I find myself tearing up for little reasons. I know it all points to depression, but it feels like no other kind of depression I have ever had. I do not really know why? There was not a single event or anything.

I am majoring in Physiotherapy, which is a pretty tough course to get into in Singapore, and the education system here is honestly overwhelming. just thinking about school and the stress that i am going to have to endure in the near future gives me panic attacks. i think its pretty ironic that i am so passionate about healthcare, but i myself have been struggling with mental illnesses for 8 years.

She always tells me that when I am an adult I would thank her for all that she is saying and i would regret my body so much. She just told me i was gaining a flabby big lower belly and i should immediately exercise. My dad is a bit better but i think that is only because we do not talk much, only a couple of times a week and 50% of our conversation is just him reminding me of how fat i am and how I would die of obesity. My sister tells me to 'just lose weight' as if i do not want to already. she is been skinny her whole life even when she eats even more than I do. It just feels like she is mocking me.I want to work on myself and i really do want to change. But i just want to lose weight when i am HAPPY, when i can love myself for who i am, where i do not need to wait for midnight to cry and vent mental breakdowns every night just so they cannot hear me. When I do not get anxiety every time i try to dress up because i feel like a whale trying to fit in barbie clothes.I am not even obese. I am just 10kg over the normal weight range for my age. And I feel like I can lose this weight when i try to. But I am just not in the right mindset right now. I cannot try and force myself to exercise without my self loathing getting even more intense when i see myself. I hope that people who says 'losing weight is easy if you just put your mind to it' sees this. I KNOW I am fat. I know i need to lose weight. I know myself and my body more than you do. I deal with more than just my weight. It comes with extreme self loathing, anxiety, and even depression. The mental burden we deal with cannot be easily cured by losing weight. So I do not need the constant reminder of how ugly and unhealthy my body looks because it just adds on to my existing self-hate. Family is the main reason i want to kms",1
"What I would be interested in is why suicide is so taboo. Why is it perceived as weak. Why should one be considerate of one's relatives. What if it is exactly the right thing for you. We should listen to our inner voice. What if our body and mind wants to tell us, this world is not for you. Let go and find your peace. I would love to let go. But I am so indoctrinated that I am not allowed to do that and my family and friends will suffer. I should seek professional help. My feeling is that my death would be a relief for me What if suicide is exactly the right thing to do",1
You do not have to but it would mean a lot Hey so I like this girl and she means so much to me but she says she does not think right and wants to distance herself from everybody but she does not want to lose me but feels like she is slipping away can somebody please help me understand abt this or help me so I can help her through it?,0
I held a knife in my hand today and cried. I wanted to slit my throat and wrists in the shower. I am just unlovable and miserable. I wish to disappear.I hate myself.I am still trying to keep going but every week is harder. I am supposed to start therapy in maybe September but idk if I can make it. I hate myself,1
"When I am asleep my dreams are perfect. I am happy. Whatever goes wrong in my life is fixed or manageable. I have everything I want. But that means falling asleep crying because I know I do not have those things. And it means waking up distraught because it was all just a dream. I want to sleep forever. I want the afterlife to just be one big dream where I can have the happiness I want but without worrying about waking up. Everyday that passes I want to just wake up the next day and have everything be back to how it was 3 weeks ago and maybe have that be a bad dream instead. Sleep is not even an escape for me anymore because its so temporary. My happiness is always temporary, alseep or awake. The only solace I get is when I am asleep and even then it is a hassle.",1
"I did not think that talking to people was that hard and I was pretty good at it, but for the last two or three years its been impossible.Every time I talk to people I always feel super uncomfortable and kill the conversation. I have to be really bad because my friends do not talk to me unless I message first. IDK what to do anymore, I cannot handle working with people and my Doctor keeps canceling my appointments the day of. I hate making people uncomfortable and that is all I feel like I do. I want to just lock my door and never come out. How do you talk to people?",0
"Usually I struggle to talk about things like the direct topic of suicide, but recently I have been having a lot of dangerous thoughts. I think I still have some hope so I really do not expect myself to, but a lot has been happing to me. both of my parents are alcoholics and my mother is disabled, so we have always been rather financially strained. Recently, one of my aunts sadly passed away (and I was not able to travel and say goodbye which I strongly dislike), but because of this we have money from her estate coming , but it has really been straining everything since my mom tends to get somewhat controlling and stubborn when the topic of buying things is in the convo. My dad is never home because he has a girlfriend (my mom knows, she is fine with it), so he never has much say in anything. And meanwhile I usually get swept up by toxic friend groups online, and I suspect I have quite a few mental disorders but until I am professionally diagnosed, I do not trust myself with that task. I have lost nearly all of the personality I have had over the year and am so matter of fact now and I cannot stand it. I never express emotions much either because I tend to hold them in a lot. Due to the financial strain, we have had to move a lot so keeping friends is impossible. And if it is not us moving its them moving, so I have never had a friend for more than a year or so in person, but I have lots of friends online who tend to stick to talking about me being financially unwell or physically unwell. I have decided I cannot rely on my personality so I need to rely on looks more to make relationships even if it is with undesirable people, which is really pushing my physical limits and makes me feel sick rather often. I am medium in that aspect, and am somewhat intelligent I assume but based off of my grades for the past year, if I am intelligent then I am also really awful at time management and study tactics. I do not even know where this is going anymore (if you cannot tell, I am very much a rambler), but I just really wish I had someone to talk to other than myself. Myself feels like it is well past the full mark, and like I am about to have some sort of manic episode. really sorta struggling",1
"I am just so fucking tired man, nothing ever changes. I tried putting in the work, driving an hour twice a week to go to DBT, I was really trying to be better. But it never lasts because at the end of the day I am still fucking empty inside. Nothing makes me happy and I just want to give up. Since last October I have had more suicide attempts than I even remember, like how am I such a fucking failure I cannot even do suicide right. (Haha laugh comedy). I wish my therapist would give me permission to die",1

"And none of this people will be sad nonsense. Yeah, maybe. But quite frankly I do not really care. I am dissociated all the time, so none of them seem real to me anyway. All I feel is pain: my pain, their pain, the whole goddamn world's fucking pain. I cannot feel anything good. The only things keeping me going are human survival instinct/the vague knowledge it is not what you are supposed to do, and the fear of permanent brain damage or disability. I am already sick, I do not want to be more sick. And I do not want to be more trapped. My biggest fear is being trapped; that is why I want to do this. Is there any legitimate reason I should not kill myself?",1

No doubt its different for everyone but I am wondering.For reference, yes, I am not in the best way right now. Physically? I am healthy. I am in a job I do not like. I have no friends. I have a girlfriend. I have somewhat a family. But I am not happy. I have things going my way, and things not going my way. How can I feel as if doing this is going to release me?

"I am a Political Science graduate who had not used my degree to full capacity because, in my country, this is just a pre-law degree with nothing much to offer unless you proceed to law school. I do not want to become a lawyer in the first place, I just took this course since I was pretty much undecided as to what career I really wanted to have in life back then.After graduating at 20 years old, I was pretty much clueless. I am just taking whatever exams available, and although I passed all of the exams that I took, but I never got to use them at all.I enrolled in law school, but quit after 1 month because its not my passion.I passed the exams to be qualified as a policeman, but never entered the police corps because I had myself a tattoo before I even knew that I passed.Now I am 25 years old and spent the last 2 years as assistant in our family business. I thought I had a career going for me as successor to the family business until yesterday, at my parents reunion with their former colleagues and friends.I drove my parents to the venue of their reunion. My parents introduced me to their friends and soon after they talked about career and work. My dads friends kept bragging about their sons and daughters and how their parenting produced IT experts, licensed engineers, nurse, psychologists, doctors, ship captains, etc.I saw how my parents looked worried about not having to brag to their friends that their only son, at 25, still had no work experience outside of family business, and just lived off a small apartment owned by my parents.Conclusion, I really f*%ked up my life. If I could just turn back time and choose a more practical degree, I might have a professional career already, like the sons and daughters of my parents friends. But here I am, trying to learn and manage a family business because what other options do I have? If I refuse to manage our family business and my parents die or something, I am nothing. Knowledge in business is the only advantage I have left in trying to compete with these young professionals. Most of the time my contributions would go unnoticed which have led to my present state of hopelessness. 25, no work experience, felt like its too late to start over again and fix the mess I did back when I was still a bad decision maker.",0

My fiancee and I got into another argument least night. A lot of shit got said and I ran once with the intention of just throwing myself of the bridge over the highway. He wrangled me back in and shit kept going. We called down and our room mate asked me to river her somewhere so I did and went to bed. Now I am getting yelled at for leaving him alone with his thoughts. For not being there for him immediately. For everything. it is my fault he is like this. I am hurting him. I am making things worse. And thus is not the first time I have contemplated just doing it. he is texting me in a rage rn. I have stayed up so many night contemplating just getting up and dying. I have googled so many methods. I got in line 3x for the suicide line and never made it to an agent each time after waiting hours. I am just so tired. Everything makes me feel guilty. I cannot say no. I am a spineless bitch. I am just.... tired. I feel cold. I want to cry but I cannot. My eyes will not let me. I feel like the little bit of juice left when you change batteries and throw them in the junk drawer. not a damn thing i do will ever be enough,1
"I have only realised this as i spoke to my mother about it.

"I have been struggling a lot the past week and a half and reaching the point of exhaustion from battling my want to die. I have had depression since I was 17 (23 now). And since graduating from college in March 2020 I have been pretty neutral about life - not necessarily un happy but definitely not excited about things. I got into a great and healthy relationship in march that ended a couple weeks ago. Its hard to process because we talked about marriage and kids and started taking steps to me converting to islam. But he said last week the shame of being in a relationship (haram) was too much and ended things. He still says he loves me, I am his best friend, that hell never meet someone who cares this much for him/will be as accepting and willing to learn and adapt to his culture and faith. He still wants to keep our friendship and be best friends. I have been struggling majorly with trying not to end my life every day since. Not in a emotional/spur of the moment decision but more life I have tried for years to make myself want to live, thought I finally was getting the future I had always wanted, and now I do not think I have the energy to try it all again. I have gone as far to research carbon monoxide poisoning from car exhaust or jumping of a local parking garage if I cannot wait until I have a free house for option 1. Basically I am struggling a lot and am asking for more options. I went to a psychiatric facility for 3 days once and it caused more trauma and distrust of my family and the mental healthcare institution. Are there options for daily therapy where I can still maintain a source of freedom? I really do not want to do inpatient or intensive outpatient but more like a support group of some kind. Thank you everyone Options other than hospital or kms? Looking for help and support",1
"my english 10 teacher during my sophomore year of high school one time she smacked her butt in front of the class (she told the class not to report her), she pretended to hit on a classmate and would give the class naughty looks.during my junior year my us history teacher was a narcissist. she thinks people with depression or having a hard time are wanting attention, she thinks knows them but she does not. she smiles if people got mad, it looked narcissistic. she pulled me out of the room and threatened to call my mom for disrespecting her but i was sticking up for a classmate who did nothing wrong, she yelled at him. i feel bad for anyone who has to deal with her. she denied me a piece of candy for being scared when she approached me. i was the shy emo kid (i still am emo, but not shy) in my school. she wanted students to bottle up their emotions and not get things off their chest to anyone. she kicked out students for petty reasons. i hated her. one i day, this take place the day after i missed the bus after school. i told her i missed the bus home and she said could take me home. one time my she whispered in my science teacher's ear while she and her were smiling at me. one time i told my us history i missed the bus the previous day i told her it came back to get me, she said to me she could have taken me home (made me feel uncomfortable).during my senior year of high school. i had an english teacher who said she was teasing me (made me feel uncomfortable). she called me a nickname (she did a lot of times) i did not like, one day i ignored her and she threatened to call my mom, i got mad, and she kicked me out of the class, she said she called me the name because she was teasing me. whenever i told her asl teacher was not a good teacher (its true she was not good), she would tell me to stop complaining saying I am just exaggerating, so i stopped venting to her. however she did hand out candy every friday (probably as a bribe)which teacher was the worst?

"I am just curious how different the feeling is for everyone. For me I could best describe it as a heavy black cloud. No matter what you do your stuck in this cloud. It makes hanging out with friends, and being all alone in your bed feel the same. It makes the world look black. Your thoughts are all negative. You instinctively hate yourself, because you do not do anything. Because you cannot do anything. Because doing something feels the same as doing nothing. It makes everything horribly repetitive. Because the feeling is stronger than any one thing you experience in your day. No matter what you do in your day, the depression will always stand out amongst everything else. Your numb to everything. It makes getting out of bed difficult. It makes thinking difficult. It makes existing difficult.How does it feel for everyone else? I feel anyone who does not have it, really cannot understand it. Because it is not just feeling low. People do not take their own life because of feeling ""low"". Idk I just wish people could understand the feeling. I am honestly convinced if everyone could feel it, just for one day, all the stigma around it would be completely gone. What Does It Feel Like?",0
"I have been sinking deeper into depression, where I am thinking more and more about how valueless my life is and about death. My s/os life has drastically changed over the past few months, due to major social media exposure. I am keeping it vague to protect his or my identity. His friend group has expanded exponentially, and he all around is thriving. I have been his support since day one, and have always been proud of his accomplishments. I am genuinely happy for him. He deserves it. But I also have been suffering in silence, because I do not want to take away from his happiness but I have also gotten into this really negative place, where I am resenting him a little bit and feeling jealous I feel bitter and lonely, and feeling valueless, dealing with serious stuff, while hes out there living it up. I always want to build him up, and continue to do so, but I also feel soooo miserable at the same time. Being around it makes me feel extremely inadequate and insecure. Idk why I am being, or feeling, this waythis is not who I am. I love him deeply, and do not want to lose him, but I am finding myself withdrawingIdk where to go from here Hiding severe depression from my s/o, while hes out living his dream.",0
"My emotions, or lack of, scare me. Over the past couple of months I have noticed that I just seem to care less and less. Literally anything could happen to me or around me and I do not know why but nothing seems to make me feel normal emotions. Two events made me super aware of my new emotional numbness. A couple months ago I got into a bad accident with my mother and she was freaking out and crying and I just sat there. I was not scared, or sad, or in shock. I was sitting in a wrecked car ready to continue the trip and move on to the next destination. Then the other time was when my dad was mad at me for something and he yelled at me and told me how disappointed he was and I again just sat there staring at him. Even after he left I just sat there then continued on with what I was doing. I feel like maybe I might be going crazy because of how numb I am sometimes. But at the same time I like being numb because I do not like having to feel. I struggle to have emotions sometimes (a little rant)",0
every night i go to sleep the exact same dream of what happened 3 years ago just playing over and over..my gf died 3 years ago when i was 15 years old she got hit by a bus right in front of my fucking house..every time i go to sleep i dream of that one dreadfull night all i hear is the tires sqeauling horn going off and her screaming then a thump..the way it origonally happened is she got hit by the bus you came running outside saw her on the ground and tryed preforming cpr on her.. what i did not realize is that she was already gone.. when the paramedics arrived a couple police officers tryed to pull me off of her and i was in so much shock that i thought it was that bus driver so i ended up knocking them out and the other two cops had to taze me..basically i think I am scarred for life from that night and idk wtf i can do to get over it.. idk wtf to do..,0

"For context, I am 16 year old and I know none of this is going to be believable or make any sense but I currently attend full time college and am finishing in December. I also work full time as a cyber sec professional. So from that obviously you may think ""damn I bet this kid is living a great life""... well the truth is I am dying inside. I have an amazing girlfriend but my upbringing was hell. Growing up I was starved, neglected, abused, emotionally left, lied to, and more because my parents were drug addicts and alcoholics, I never had anyone. My mom passed due to the abuse and I think that is why my mental illness is so bad. I appear to be living an amazing life but everyday my mood changes like crazy and I just want to leave everything. I hate waking up and I hate sleeping... I just hate everything. Everything tiks me off and I am just so overwhelmed with my own emotions. I am sad as fuck 24/7 for no reason I feel, I have extreme past thramu from my younger days and I just am done. I am still living at home and am going to move the day I turn 18, I already have $ for a place but in the meant time I have two more years of hell to go through. I have 0 friends anymore because I am very busy and do not have time to do what I used to, which is not that bad but I just am alone. All my friends are above 20 so its hard to relate. I cannot go ""hang"" with them because its just feels weird because I am at such a different stage of life than they are but at the same time I am not....

"My adopted parents and I have not gotten along in awhile due to my depression. They constantly act like I can get up each morning, take care of myself, find a job etc. I cannot I have told them time and time again I cannot.. they even lied to my therapist about it. They want to move out in less than a year now to retire and Ill have no where to go. Ill lose my health insurance so all the medicine I need to take each day will be gone. I told myself so many times the moment I am homeless is when Ill find a way to die. They care about their happiness more than they care about me.. I am tired of them lying to me telling me they care then turn right around and do something that proves they do not. My only chance of living is trying to apply for disability but they are so against it I just know they have sabotaged it some how so I am probably going to get denied over and over. I have told them my plans and they brush it off and think I am not serious. you can threaten us with that all you want.

"So I have had suicidal ideation come and go for the past few years, it can be pretty scary but I manage to pull through.

What percent of people with suicidal ideation actually commit suicide?",0
What is a prison. A place where you are detained against your own will. What is life. A place that you end up by mystery and unable to leave. Leaving entails death by suicide. Fear of the unknown keeps you here in this prison. Life is not a gift is a fn curse. Every day is disappointing filled with evil. You have to constantly watch your back. Sound familiar?I am certainly hating life and wish this works would end. It will not. Never end on it is own. it is a prison and I am a prisoner. Wish I was dead How is life a gift? More like a prison.,1

But, I still have a lot of resistance to overcome. I want to be able to do the deed in a calm, detached manner.

"I have struggled with mental illness my whole life. From the early age of 6 I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. Later on at about 10 I was diagnosed with ADHD, and than a few years later diagnosed with depression. My first depressive episode took place when I was on middle school, and after seeing a therapist weekly and going on meds I soon became happy and content with my life. However, a few years later (now) I (F17) decided to try and go off my meds. Talking to my parents, doctor, and therapist, we decided to give it a try. And for the first month or so, I was completely fine. Nothing was wrong, and I felt good. But I soon after had fell into a depressive episode. My trigger was, and had been the time before, an internal feeling that I was not good enough. This time the trigger had been not getting a part I wanted in a show I was acting in, pushing all these intrusive thoughts into my head. The main one that I have struggled with however is the thought of suicide. I do not know why. I do not want to die, I do not want everything to end, but I cannot shake the thought. And over the next few months, it just got worse. I ended up getting into a relationship with a guy from school and we have been dating for almost 3 months. Over this time though I have developed ROCD to the point where I think of my bf and I immediately feel miserable. I feel so bad because he likes me so much, and I cannot stop with all the ROCD intrusive thoughts. It got to the point where I would nervous vomit every time I knew I was going to see him. I have no idea what to do. I have ruined multiple events/vacations/parties for myself by just ruminating on the ROCD thoughts of whether I actually like him or not or if were supposed to be together. I have just fucked up the past few months of my life and relationship. Since then, I have gone back on my meds and am seeing my therapist more frequently. Me and my bf are currently on a break, but we are meeting up to decide on what to do in 3 days. I have genuinely been better when I have been able to focus on myself, but I really do not want to break up with him, however hard the relationship might be. I have major guilt from the depression and ROCD thoughts and I do not know what the next step to take is. I have been having these thoughts since we first started dating, so how do I know this is just ROCD, or are me not meant to be together? My depression has ruined my relationship with my bf and myself",0
"2 years ago I was completely different person, Infact at the time I had never experienced depression before. I was very happy, I grew up very fortunate with a big family and many friends. Growing up I really never experienced being depressed. I am 25 and I am in my graduation year, hoping to apply for masters once I am done but I have lost my will to do anything I want.It all started 3 years ago when I decided to study abroad, at the beginning I felt lonely but nothing really painful, I would just get sad at times and wish I still had my friends. But I got used to it, not having as much friends and hangout daily etc... Fast forward 1 year I met a girl and started dating. 2 years later we decided to break up and then the lockdown happened. From here I have been consistently sad.I really really loved and and I still my ex, but I took many dumb decisions. I regret them but how could I know they were dumb if I did not take them in first place. She was very mentally unstable as she suffered with depression and personal problems.I just consistently miss my ex, I feel kind of weak and sometimes I lose respect to myself that I still think about her, but simply I just love her, and it seems that there is nothing that will change it not even by one inch, I met another girl we hung out but I could feel nothing towards her. its almost like I will never love anyone else. I have accepted that we will never be back together which is pains me but I got used it(she is dating someone else now). It does not matter how many people I meet, hook ups or whatever I just cannot find a replacement for her in my life and its been 2 years but I still love her and respect her. I genuinely wish her nothing but happiness.The lockdown, my ex, losing my homie, losing my job due go health issue ( vulnerability to covid) has put me in all time low situation. I have gained some weight, eventhough I eat twice a day only. I became bitter and the happy guy from 2 years ago simply does not exist anymore, an inferior version of him in every aspect. I do not see my self winning again, it feels like 2 years ago my life peaked and Its over like Its not going to happen again, I just have to accept living a miserable life I guess knowing I will never be as haply as I used to be. I have failed to treat my depression, I am lost.",0
"I am a coward, I do not have the guts to take my own life, but why does not my body give up on my part. I have not done anything to deserve this, I wish my body stops working in sleep everyday. My parents, so many expectations, so many hopes, I crush them all, day in, day out. My parents deserved a much, much better child, they did not deserve a disaster like me, but they still love me and it makes me do guilty. I am beyond repair, but still I cannot dispose myself off, cowardice. I do not want to exist, I wish I get replaced by someone else or at the least get vanished into oblivion along with all the traces and memories I have in this world. Fuck this rant sounds cringe sorry you had to read this. Why does my heart keep beating, my body keeps working hard to keep me alive, even though I have given up?",0

"I feel sad and alone with nobody that really cares about me. Every day I think about ending my life and I tell myself that it is only a matter of time. People say there is always hope and all you need is something to hold onto. There is very little in my life that is worth holding onto. It seems like every opportunity in my life I have lost or for whatever reason it has been taken away from me. My health is not great, and it is not getting better, it is going to do me in eventually. I do not do drugs except the ones I am prescribed, and I do not drink.A lot of the time, I feel trapped inside myself and inside a life I do not want. I have stopped leaving home, not unless I have to, and I just want to get back home as soon as I can. I do not feel comfortable being around people any more.I unfriended just about everybody who is not family on Facebook, and I closed my account a day or so ago. It sucks that I have so little to share with anyone and nothing in common. Mostly, I just share music videos and random stuff that no one is interested in.There is no one close to me except my elderly mother who I live with. She cares about me, and she is probably my only reason for hanging on. it is going to be hard managing without her because I really depend on her. I feel pathetic admitting it.It feels good to share, maybe I am looking for attention, I tired of this stuff weighing me down all the time. There is so much more to my story, and maybe I will share it, I do not know. I saw an AA meeting on TV, the support group and the whole sponsor thing, and I wondered why there is not something like that for someone like me. I do not like therapy, I am done with it. It does not work, especially when you know that there is a cut-off point to the sessions. Lack of funding. It feels like they do not give a dam until you try to hurt yourself or someone else. Not until you become a problem, and they are forced to deal with you.At least if I can share stuff here with you guys and get stuff out of my system. Maybe, it will make me feel a bit better. Thanks for reading this. I am feeling tired.",0
"Today morning was my school best friend's sister's marriage but I did not go. I have not talked to her in the past 1 years and because of covid and some other issue, I feel very sad and depressed lately. I do not want people to see me in this state but I feel guilty about not going. My friend did not invite me personally she said it in group and invited all. For the past 1 years, I am really in a bad phase in my life. I feel guilty now. What should I do? I told her I could not make it because of my training but the thing is I do not want people to see me and judge me. Feeling guilty",0

I am overweight and cannot seem to keep motivated long enough to actually make a difference, cannot do the one thing I have always wanted to do which is to travel, hell I cannot even kill myself because I have too many responsibilities.

"I was living with my partner's family in a foreign country during the pandemic. During the onset of the pandemic i was highly stressed and crying all the time. I had to return home to renew my passport. I got home and felt so depressed. I am almost 30 and my parents were criticizing me constantly. Started having constant suicidal ideation. I finished my MA during the pandemic and have struggled to find work. My parents were supporting me, but when i chose to return to my partner. They cut me off. Which i understand, but now its so much more pressure. I have applied to over a 100 jobs in the last 6months, with several interviews, but no luck. It'a affecting my self esteem in a BIG way. I am now dipping heavily into my savings. I thought i would be happier with my partner. Suicidal ideation is less, but damn. I feel awful. And i have no motivation to apply for jobs or wake up. Now that I am in a foreign country with 0 friends or support systms i feel like i just made my life worse. But i feel like all options are awful. And nothing would make me happy anyway. I hate that nothing brings me joy anymore. How can i make decisions? How can i fix my life by becoming financially independent if I cannot to wake up to apply for jobs?

"I was prescribed 5mg as an adjuvant for venlafaxine, but it did not help and made me hungry all the time (and my appetite before was normal).I started by taking 2.5mg for a week, then 5mg for 6 weeks, and before stopping I was on 2.5mg for a week (overall 2 months).The first week after stopping I had reduced appetite. After that, my appetite went down to 0 and has been like this for 2 weeks. Not even my daily mirtazapine (45mg) managed to give me appetite (and it used to before).How much longer would I have to deal with this? I have never been prescribed a med that fucked me up so long after stopping it, especially not after only taking it 2 months (and I have been prescribed *a lot* of different meds). How long do olanzapine withdrawal symptoms last?",0

"During my early teens I have come to the realization that I knew I would not want much part of this world. I cannot feel any type of satisfaction in life Neither family, significant other, or even the simple pleasure of food. As much as I try to surround myself with positivity the feeling of emptiness drowns it. My birthday was a few days ago and pictures were taken. Looking back at them I can see into my own eyes my soul screaming for release. I have lost 30lbs from eating either too little or not at all. I slowly feel like I am reaching my limit and I am scared to reach for help.. An abyss",1

"I know how my life ends: I end it. I just do not know when, I do not know how, and I am pretty sure I know why. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, no matter how much work I put in, I am not enough. It does not matter if I have money, if I have an amazing job I love, if I am funny, if I am smart, if I am kind. It does not matter how much love I have to give, how much effort I put in, or how far Id go just to feel what its like to have love reciprocated. I am tired of reaching out to people who I know will not miss me, or will just tell me I need to take meds just so they do not have to deal with me. I could do everything perfectly and to everyone I have ever loved, they would still ask for more and go off with someone else anyways. Death can end this sorry excuse for an existence. I do not care if it gets better. I do not care if there is nothing after, and I do not care the irreversible damage my death will because. I want it. I want it now more than I have wanted anything in my whole life. More than travel, more than money, more than love. I simply want it to end because its become abundantly clear I am not of value to anyone and never will be. I just want it to end. The torment, the pain. The emptiness, the silence. All of it. there will be a smile on my face when they find me, because the only peace I can have left in this life is knowing that its finally over, that I can rest. I know how my life ends",0

"I work at a ice cream kiosk, and fuck me.I keep doing things wrong,Today the ice cream machine had some yellow stuff growing inside and had to be emptied and cleaned and I did not know what to do even though I have seen it done before, and the boss shouted at us again and it is sucks.I cannot focus, it is soo hot inside there and my mind feels like it is being fried, we do not get breaks even though I work 7.5 hours 5 times a week and I only get to drink a bottle of water during the day.What sucks is that a lot of the time I am too slow at closing because I have to clean and get everything in order for the next day and I also need to serve costumers too, it especially sucks when they order a milkshake, because I have to thoroughly clean it all over again so it does not stink the next day.I need to empty the dirty water under the sink, wash the floor, wash the counters, check and fill what is missing, get shouted at, see what we do not have and is needed more of and write it down.I cannot work overtime all the time, the owner does not have that kind of money for thing's that has been broken and need to be repaired.When I first started everything went fine and I actually was applauded on doing good, but now I feel like I have to keep doing good and better, but my mental health has taken a beating recently and I am falling into old habits of suicidal ideation, I feel so hopeless and I am terrifed of being fired, I keep waking up at 5 am and cannot fall asleep until 2 am or later.I take every criticism and failure to heart, I need to be as perfect as humanly possible, because if you are not you get scolded or fired and shit, it is a start up business, so it might even fail because of bad employees like me.I have always wanted to function like a good person, but I do not know if I can, or if I even want to anymore, I want to punch the fucking wall and shout my lungs out.

I then get high enough to tolerate existence, and search through a dozen or so sites/apps looking to see if I got any replies from the people I had messaged the day before. Almost always every inbox is empty and it is a waste of time.I then tell myself to get to work. But I do not, I lament my empty life of failures, browse dating websites, try to engage, interest and attract strangers because I have already failed endless times with the people I know. I tell myself to exercise, as though that is the key to someone finally wanting me. No one even talks to me, they never get to a point they see me with my shirt off, it does not matter if I get ripped. So I cannot keep the motivation to exercise because I know it is useless. I cannot get a first date, muscles do not matter if no one ever sees them.And exercise for my health? I want to die. I am just too cowardly to do it myself. Might as well do it the slow way. Might as well pick up a drug habit, I have the money and the lack of will to live.My energy is constantly low, it saps through the day and I just collapse into bed. Sleep for about 10 minutes before my physical and mental discomfort make me get back up. I do this about a half dozen times a day, sleeping for about ten minutes a stretch, sometimes sleeping a few hours. I do not really do full nights of sleep ever since my cat died.I have always been a terrible sleeper, but when she curled up on my chest and made me feel like I was not alone I could finally rest. But now I am alone, there is no rest. there is just constant turmoil.My mind stays in an endless fog. My thoughts have become increasingly incoherent, increasingly cynical, increasingly angry, increasingly malevolent. Without someone to love, I am becoming monstrous. All this love in my heart turns to rage, I burn bridges, attack anyone who bothers me even slightly, and of course become a burdensome ranting idiot that makes the few people who still tolerate me not want to tolerate me anymore. I should have killed myself the day my cat died. Only a creature reliant on me for food and comfort could possible love me to the extent I need to function. A human has never wanted to have that level of closeness with me, and likely never will.Six years since I had any family.Four years since someone has touched me sexually.A little over a year since my cat, my only reason to keep trying to exist in this shitty world died.I have been going on with no reason to live for over a year. I do not know that I can do it much longer and there is no sign of anything changing in my future. This is all just more melodramatic horseshit that no one's going to read. Just writing it for catharsis because I have no other way to release stress. I do not really get a cathartic feeling from these rants anymore though, it is more just a sampling of my daily mental deterioration. Yet another generic depressing rant.",0

Do I have a symptom/am I crazy?Okay so I (14F) have a sister(16F). And were pretty close like really really close. Our mother passed away when we was younger(she was murder) . 7 and 5 years old. So its really just us to against the world. My sister is really quiet and does not talk to no one. While I on the other hand is completely the opposite. But ig after my mother passing and other shit happening. I have this feeling to protect my sister from everyone and everything. Like I never been away from her for more then 3 days. And if she does not go then I will not go and vis-versa ( sorry for bad spelling) but yea I am usually the one to do everything(which I have no problem with) and I always keep track of my sister to protect her from anything and anyone because I do not want to lose her. ( our dad is not in our life) but whenever my sister goes to work we share locations so I check it every 5 minutes. Because every negative possibility fills my head that something is happening to her like she is getting murdered or something. She understands how I feel when it comes to her for the most part. But then a lot of times at night I go into her room and just cry because I cannot stop myself from thinking someone is going to kill her while she is sleep and take her from me. And I just watch by the door with something sharp. Waiting for someone to try to take her from me. And she is knows and she tells me nothing is going to happen but I cannot help it. Like she is mine(my sister) I cannot let anything happen to her. I have no memory of our mom. But all I know is once I saw her in the casket. I vowed to let nothing happen to my sister. But I think there something wrong with me because sometimes when I am by myself I just talk out of nowhere forming a plan to kill anyone that try to hurts my sister. And it feels like someone is talking back to me . But I do not even care I just want to keep my sister safe. So is there something wrong with me? Please help me.,1
"I am diagnosed with depression. I will be starting meds, most likely Zoloft since things are not getting better with therapy. One big symptom of my depression is low energy.

My mom and grandma also are on/used to be on Zoloft for depression, and it helped for my mom at least. My psych said it should help with my anxiety also.

"I have been depressed since I was 7. Major trauma does that to you. And I have tried to commit suicide 7 times: 3 before I was 10, 4 after. But I am 'high-functioning.' I can do the things people expect me to do: get good grades, win competitions, act happy (and sometimes even *be* happy). But I cannot get myself to brush my teeth, take a shower, change my clothes, or care about my personal hygiene when no one is watching. I am still depressed, and I have been diagnosed with depression.So, here is my problem: my parents do not believe me. They say I am faking it, that it gets better, or that this is normal and everyone goes through it. So, I cannot take meds (I am 17). How do I convince them that this is *a problem*. That I am depressed, not because people will pay attention, but because *I am*? And, since most people I know just disregard my depression and say the same things as my parents, I am starting to not believe myself. Am I faking it? Maybe I am Faking It",0
"Today marks the 9th anniversary of the promise that I made to myself, it was I would try very hard to make something of myself, try to be nice and help as much as I can and if things are still looking no better and I have made no friends then I would end my life at the 10th anniversary of the promise.9 yrs down things are still rough, yes I have learned so so much but life is not any better,I have tried multiple ideas, projects, business models it is always something unusually unlucky, Made 1 friend during the time and he stopped talking to me 2 months later due to some stupid misunderstanding.All the helping people really got me nowhere, do not get me wrong it felt good in my conscience but I guess you are not supposed to expect help in return.One year to go I have my will all written up, I still would try for another year but after that I am donating all my capital and my organs and leave my story in a free ebook named ""An epic tale of misfortune"".(PS: book is less depressing and more comedic listing some of the stupidest ways life cucked me over) 9th Anniversary of my promise",0

"I am going into senior year in high school this year, and for as long as I can remember I have just felt like I do not fit it. Like I do not belong. After a few years, I would say around 6th or 7th grade it turned into depression. I was seemingly indifferent to nearly everything imaginable. I was not sad, I was not happy, I was neutral. And it is been the same since then. I have no reason to not be happy. I live in an upper middle class family. Nice house, my parents are great, my older brother is as nice as an older brother can be. I have a nice job and get paid well. I am just not happy for some reason. I had friends for a while, but one day I stopped texting first and after a bit I never heard from them again. But the was okay, I am pretty antisocial anyway. it is been years since I had any real friends. I have never had an real interests, nor hobbies. I have done many sports, but only because my parents made me. I was just mediocre at them. I always just wanted to go home and go back to sleep. My latest sport I did was Mountain Biking, I did it 9th and 10th grade but quit before the season for 11th grade started. Since then, I have not done much. I just wake up, go to school/work, come home, lay in bed for a few hrs and eventually go to sleep for the night. Rinse and repeat. I do not know what I want to do as a career. I do not know what I want to go to college for, if I do go to college. I think id be fine majoring in whatever. I am not interested in pursuing anything, because I have nothing I want to pursue. I had never experienced suicidal thoughts until now, I think I was pretty content with my life up until a few weeks ago. Since then I have just found myself asking over and over, ""is this life really worth it?"" ""why should not I just do it?"" I have had a really bad time sleeping lately because of these thoughts. Hence why I am posting this at 1am haha. I have never self harmed before, never seen the point. Never had the incentive to. If I were to commit, I would want it to be quick and as painless as possible. I have thought it over a ton. I have been tempted to unbuckle my seatbelt while driving and just slam into a tree, obviously have not worked up the gut to do that yet. I have been tempted to use a noose, but I have not found a place to hang it. Lastly, I have thought of just slitting my throat. I think if I were to commit that would be the most likely because. Anyway, back to it. I do not have a reason I should feel this way, everything in my life is fine. And that makes me feel worse. It makes me feel guilty. And that guilty feeling does not help. it is just and endless cycle round and round. I thought maybe writing this down might help, and there was no reason not to so why not. I have no reason to be suicidal, but I am.",1

I feel so overused, yet I cannot remember feeling like I have done anything in months, years maybe. I keep falling into the trap of reasoning away this sense of living without a rudder, but every time I try to outsmart the depression, I end up feeling enraged at circumstances that are out of my control and incapable of handling the things that are.

"Hello guys, I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this (and sorry for my english in advance) but i wanted to tell you how unusual I have felt since 2 days ago. Basically since I woke up on Tuesday I have been feeling numb, like there is a fog in my brain and i lost interest for activities I normally do and really enjoy, like watching movies.The weirdest thing about it is that I have irrational thoughts about it, like literally 3 days ago i was watching old obscure essay films and literally the next day I found myself thinking ""what is the point of movies? they are fake, those are actors"" and I cannot wrap my head around this.Added to the fact that I have constantly felt tired and sleepy I naturally thought about depression or anxiety, but i have never had any of those things before, in fact I am usually the cheer-up guy in the family and usually find the silver lining even out of the most dark situations that have happened, so it is being very sudden and unexplainable (nothing has happened in my personal life lately either to justify this).I also thought it might be a side effect of Nasonex, that is a corticosteroid nasal spray I have taken since the 8th of July and I have read it has some side effects, but in the instructions it does not say anything about psychological effects so i kind of wrote it off. Then looking online I have read corticosteroids can actually produce anxiety or depression sometimes but it is very rare. So i basically do not know what to believe.Has anything like this happened to you before?Thanks in advance Weird symptoms for the past 2 days",0

Also there is my dysphoria and paranoia mixed up in this as well. Before I tell you my whole life story I keep it short: Yes, I have been to a psychologist but it is not possible due to Covid at the moment. And I never had any friends in my life as people rather liked to bully me and physically hurt me (that is why I am glad I am out of school for so many years now) and almost got me killed once by throwing me in front of a bus. Anyways I noticed that my eyesight got worse and worse over the years. Can it be because of depression or because I stay up all night (I am very nocturnal) for years now? I had a sharp crisp eyesight a few years ago where I couldf see details 10m away but now I cannot even Identify faces anymore from one meters. (sorry for using the metric system, I am not american) I am scared to go blind. Additonal Note: My hearing is actually my greatest strenght and the only sense left that is close to superhuman as proven by multiple tests in the past that I took. (I do not like to mention it because it is considered cringe and unnormal and I am very ashamed of it but the hearing thing might be because of my autism.) Can depression worsen your eyesight?",0
"I am having raging suicidal thoughts as I type this. I am queer and have a loving girlfriend, but unemployed since the pandemic hit. I lost many friends along the way and it made me wonder the following:Am I a bad person? Well, I could say I am an alright person but one who makes bad decisions when in awful circumstances. I tend to self sabotage when things go too well, I used to opt out of many gatherings because the social anxiety affected me greatly.However, there is one particularly important friend which I lost along the way. This friendship was a healthy one, and throughout our 5 years of knowing each other, there was not a single moment we had a fight that lasted over a day. In fact, we barely fought. We knew each other so well, we celebrated each other's wins, we cried when the other cried. I loved her so much and I always dreamt we would be friends till our hair turned grey.But something happened during the pandemic which broke our friendship. In retrospect it was INCREDIBLY petty and dumb, but I guess my reaction to it was so out of character to her that it made her change her mind about me completely. All of us were cooped up at home on lockdown, and during that time Singaporeans (us) were not allowed to meet anyone outside of the household. I come from a deeply dysfunctional family and trust me, the atmosphere at home is not something I want to describe in detail because it would just bring back very painful memories. Basically I was not mentally great, and I felt very alone and unwanted.During my birthday, my friend wished me via IG(photo montage) and DM. I missed her terribly and I felt so so SO lost without her. It was 3 months that I had not met this particular friend. In a way, it was my mistake for depending on her for my happiness, I mean, we are both adults so why did I cling on to the notion that my friends would save me from the catastrophe which was my mental health and basically, general home life? Fast forward a month later, I found out she delivered birthday presents to this guy who was her friend, a guy I could not stand. A fellow cohort graduate, This guy was, for some odd reason, fine with my friend but despised me. We did not click, and let us just say he intentionally blocked certain projects from me because he did not like me. I wish I could say I was a bitch to him or gossiped about him, or said anything mean, but I never did. he just had a natural inkling to dislike me. Our cohort was infamous for this type of childish behaviour, so my best guess was that he heard a rumor about me and believed it. Though he never told my friend about any of this because HE KNEW we were tight. So weird. Regardless, I got mad. I felt neglected and forgotten. I wondered how important I was to her if she could send him physical gifts but nothing my way. I felt like I deserved something more since we WERE close friends. When I asked her why she made this decision, she said she felt bad for HIM because he was complaining how lonely and sad he felt during lockdown. The irony was so thick like toffee, I blew up. See? see how stupid and circumstantial this whole thing is? I wanted something, ANYTHING to make me feel wanted and my own close friend could not see that. We sent each other novel-length texts trying to justify our actions(for over an hour), until I decided to block her for a minute or two so we could cool down. She was offended and hurt by this, and instead of waiting for an explanation, she blocked me on all forms of social media and never spoke to me again. We have not spoken since last year and I am still heartbroken about it. I have apologised to her multiple times, telling her how wrong I was for reacting that way, that it was purely circumstantial because of well...EVERYTHING (isolation, family trauma, dysfunction at home, existing mental illness, unemployment, sending presents to a whole ass bully) but she did not accept my apologies. I still think about her nearly every other day. I thought she was my soulmate in a way but apparently our friendship was as flexible as glass. The thing is, I am aware I made mistakes. I quickly got myself a counsellor after the incident and spoke to her on zoom during lockdown. I tried to make changes to myself to be the best version of me if we could meet again next time, but, I just feel like I can never be forgiven. I have spent years struggling with my own self-doubt, self-esteem, anxiety and chronic depression, and I honestly really thought I hit the jackpot when I met this friend. She was patient and non-judgemental, and all those years we had as friends, I never trauma dumped on her, or at least I thought I did not? If she could have told me if I made mistakes along the way I would have changed everything. I wish I saw the signs.Now that it is been a year, I feel like there is a gaping hole in my chest that has yet to be filled. Even my girlfriend cannot fill it. I feel like there is something inherently wrong and damaged with me after I lost this one friend. I do have other good friends, it is true, but losing one, just one, has ruined my outlook on life and myself as a person. So right now, I just need some help figuring out if I am a fucked up, unfixable wackjob or if I should try to reconnect with her again.or did I just make bad friendships that could not survive a pandemic? Please let me know. Thank you, Reddit. One year anniversary of a falling out with a best friend",1
"I just want to be put down, I do not deserve to live and I hate it here. The only thing keeping me here is the painful process and my survival instincts. All I am is a burden for other people, no one ficking likes me and I am a piece of shit.

"Hi everyone. I have been seeing a guy sort of on and off since last fall. He recently revealed to me that he struggles with depression. Until then, I thought a lot of his behaviors (cancelling plans to play video games, for example) were just him being a dick. Maybe, though, depression is having it is way with him? I want to try and be understanding and supportive without smothering him or making him uncomfortable. What things can a partner or s/o do for you when you are experiencing depression that are actually helpful? How to be supportive?",0
"Well it is most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there is a chance it will be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that is already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It was not there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it is spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I am scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that is always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I do not want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I do not actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I am scared for that; my first biopsy did not give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. I am terrified of that happening again.I am just so full of uncertainty and I am scared and I feel like I am not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I do not get to be upset. But I am. But I do not want to be. I am conflicted. I am upset. I want to sleep so I do not have to feel.Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways. The cancer has spread to my liver",0

"I used to wonder how somebody could still have depression when in a relationship. By now I am married with kids and fully understand how. there is no empathy, no true intimacy. Only constant defense. She does say the 3 words but only as answer never by herself.

"Not looking for advice necessarily but shit if you have any lmk I just need to vent and be heard because I do not have anyone in my personal life to talk to. I am an introvert so its easy for me to be alone, however having no emotional support can be rough. I have had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. It started to get really bad when I was around 12. I am 22 now, and I still struggle with it. My family members and the people I work with think I am fine and that Ill always be ok, because I put on a happy face and try to help others with their problems to distract me from mine. I throw myself into work as well. It does not matter how much I try to distract myself though, I still feel so lost and hopeless. I do not even have interest in music anymore, one of my favorite things :( I know that the only person who can change my situation is me, but I feel like no matter how hard I try I still just want to go back into my dark bedroom and be alone.

"After having worked on myself so hard and getting back in contact with him, things were going wonderfully. I fixed so much of the problems that caused issues in our relationship. We were meeting every week and slowly getting closer again. Until last night.Of course I could not control my drinking at the bar and of course I had to start a fight with him. I do not even remember what I did or told him, but it was enough for him to say he does not care about me anymore and never wants to talk to me again. The one thing I remember is begging him to please tell me why this was happening and to not leave. He took back his apartment key from me and gave me back mine. it is over for good. The one person I have ever loved is gone and it is all my fault.I feel like such a failure for having lost control of my drinking. I am such an idiot for ruining the second chance I got. I love him so much and I failed him as a boyfriend not once, but twice. Now, I just want to end it all. I have to end it all. I just cannot continue knowing that I set myself on this path. Knowing that I broke his heart.I do not know when I am going to do it, but I know it is going to be soon. I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts and the biggest regret I have always had was not going through with my suicide back when I was a teen. All of this pain could have been avoided if I had just gone through with it.I do not care if there is anything after death.

"As I write in r/depression. I state my life is fine. I know decent people and I have survived the indecent. I have learned a lot and my life is very decent for a 26 year old black man born in low class society. The worst thing in my life is probably masturbation and with that I am down to like 1 a days. I have goals and dreams. My family is decent enough. I have ladies in my life. I am actually Elevating, I can feel it. I have never gotten the girl I was after, everyone I have wanted I have failed at, so all my loves are circumstantial. I achieve in all but the loves I choose. In that I have still had women, I still achieve the casual sex, and I am about to be a millionaire and I doubt that will hurt my chances and I have even analyzed all my failure and it is made me better in my approach... so yea nothings wrong with me. Failure was never an option because I did not quit. I believe in God and I have beat the suicidal tendencies. there is nothing I dislike more in a game than a quitter. Why r/depression? I feel like life's been an interesting ordeal to say the least but fuck I feel like being a black man on this planet blows. If I had not joined the military in the past I would be fucked on a highway to nowhere right now and it is only getting worse on this planet. I was born 1995 before Gameboy got color and as we evolved through technology it feels to me that we have devolved as beings. Shit, I myself am piece of work and I work hard. It took a lot to be this decent, I literally dealt with years of darkness and still do, but I do not want to kill anyone, or destroy the world... I used to though. Honestly I think everyone is capable of anything if they put their mind to it but you must be willing to continue.Information is key, you have to be willing to grow. You must apply information to effort, no matter how fast or slow. The snail does not know where the fuck it is going and its not even capable of high speeds but that fuckers moving. Being poor, being stagnant, these are mindsets. Set your mind to something else. Knowing your situation is half the battle, the rest is faith baby. The odds of any of this existence bullshit do not exist, infinitesimal. Which means you are already beating the odds. Keep fucking fighting do not quit. This is for me as much as it is for whoever reads.I hope you equalstand... the better you are, the better I am, the better we can be to eachother, that is better people on the planet, making things a slightly better place. it is those who know the darkness that shine the brightest. Be brave. The time is always now. Do with that info what you will. I hope reddit does not remove this. I hope it touches someone. You are not alone in your suffering, there are others, there is hope, you are a good enough reason to continue. You are a great enough reason to be better.

"I am thinking I might add more. I have cut out personal names==================Unfriend me now to make this easier on yourself. I am going to kill myself now or kill myself later. Call the cops to ease your mind, no ones going to find me. Waste your time by telling you care when you do not, because I know when all seems good people do not care. Give me your reason that I am wrong to say such things. Say to me that you have been going through what I have been going through. People with double standards against me, that judge me ignorantly, deny it please, so you can feel better about yourself. I have had enough of every Christian with a double standard of love; you rather judge than get to know others. You do not know me, because you judge me. And I do not know you because I judge you. If you talk behind my back, you should grow up and talk face to face. But fuck that now, it is too late.So now, know me for the fucking piece of shit I am. I am a fool, I know nothing. But you are wise, discerned, you know many things. Tell me what ought to do. I am weak and broken. Yet you are strong.No more condescension. No more bullying. No more emotional abuse. For those who are wondering about Christianity, a lot of them are just broken imperfect people acting like they are perfect.They ignore fellow believer that struggles with depression. Some of them forgive you and cut you off, for something they did that they cannot see. Some them lie straight to your face saying that they care for you, and then go ignoring you. Some of them are your best friends, that say they are there for you; but then drop you like a stone when it gets too heavy. Some of them use you, and again for sake of their image, get rid of you, because you are brokenness is too much of a mess. Some of make falsehoods about you to justify what they say, when you really just need someone to talk to. Also I find it hard to believe that Christians would rather isolate you than love you.More than 5 years of wanting to kill myself. I cannot talk about it. People say I talk to much about it, shut me down. People say I should be happy, shut me down. People say I am not the only one, shut me down. Now I will not talk about it. Now, I will try to be happy. Oh now, I know I am not the only one. Tell me with your learned words, I am being unfair in my statements. Call me arrogant for saying these things for feeling this way. My heart has been filling up because I have been silenced by a hardened heart of people, and now it is spilling over. All I see is evil. Christians should not ignore someone who is struggling, we are supposed to represent Christ's love, but it seems these people get caught up in themselfs rather then share love. I am joining them, I am going to think about myself as I kill myself. No more Christains with double standards of love. People who are so focused on their image ethier online or in person; no more. Is too hard encourage others? Or is it just encouraging specific people you do not like? And again, for those who think I am always negative. You paint pictures that you want to see. Never hearing the broken. No more prejudice.Out of everything I cannot stand, the most is myself, so I am ending it. I am finding somewhere secluded. And it would be a shame to hear from me again after saying all this crap. I am making sure it is done. Also I do not want to be locked up, and go through the same thing that is making me type this.And for those thinking I am seeking attention, use your brain. Even if it is that, does not mean it is not a cry for help? But I have to prove to those who think like that. I am going to kill myself, do not worry. I could write book from this heart of pain and thought, so give me your wise words. Look at your heart and learn from yourself. This does not apply to everyone, but that does not mean by saying that, you are one the ones this does not apply too; judge for yourself; fucking look in the mirror and actually look. are not you wise? Or do you know that you know nothing? Both trains of thought gives you all the more reason to look at yourself.This is the only stage I am getting, my death. Let me make a splash, so you can forget about me. I am sorry I am unbearable, it is my fault that I am too much to bear. I am sorry I am annoying, it is my fault. Now with your knowledge, hear what I am actually saying. Fuck this rant for being stupid. I fucking do not deserve anything. Rape me with your words, and tell me how stupid I am between the lines, or something like that. This is sad. No one wants to truly die. However, if you force feed your own words into someone is mouth; not giving a someone a chance to speak, they will be voiceless. And voicelessness is what kills.

"Hi folks. For about 7 years now, I have felt general depression like symptoms that may or may not be associated with depression: 1) low self esteem, 2) general FOMO and always feeling like I am receiving the short end of experiences or no experiences at all 3) resentment without because towards successful people or for acquaintances that I interact with (attractive people in particular) 4) getting upset and impatient when I am not where I want to be in life5) more introverted behaviour than I probably would be otherwise displaying. 6) General anxiety when engaging socially with others 7) resort to escapism when upset8) when at social events, get upset and think about the past about the lack of social experiences and how unfair life is There were times it was not always like this, that is what makes me skeptical about my own diagnoses. Some of the things I described above have been on and off. Although as of late, I have felt all of that. Your thoughts would be very much appreciated. Should I get a diagnoses? I suspect my own life circumstances contribute to these feelings, that is why I am unsure whether to get a diagnoses or just fix my own life. Not sure if I am depressed",0

I do not see any reason to live anymore, nobody In my house listens to me, I guess talking to me about literally fucking ANYTHING is the most difficult thing ever, every. GOD DAMN. THING. yet they can criticize me however they want, I am lazy, I am Ignorant, I am negative, I am crazy.. fucking assholes. some people were not meant to be fucking parents, I will tell you that right now.. sharing anything with them is like talking to a god damn brick wall, my entire life you have just yelled at me and never pushed me to do anything out of my comfort zone.

I feel like putting her through this now instead of later when she just started healing would be less-cruel, but I do not know.. I just hope my dad will be able to help her through this, but I cannot continue, I do not want to continue.. I do not want to waste so much pointless fucking energy just to grow old and die alone, I do not want to continue living In a fucking awful home filled with people who do not even acknowledge me, I do not want to continue being alone while everyone around me has some connection to something or someone... so, I am done.

"This feels very weird to do this, but maybe I just need to get it off my chest. I have been struggling for a long time now with suicidal thoughts. Probably since I was a teenager. I have a really hard time making friends and understanding social media so I often feel constantly left out. And on top of that I am an aspiring artist that cannot seem to get their career off the ground. I do not feel like a failure, I am one. No matter how hard I try or what I do Ali just can not seem to get anything right. I have developed terrible coping mechanisms and pretending to be happy is not working anymore. I am usually the person that people go to when they are sad, because I like making them feel better. But I do not seem to have a person I can do that with. Life seems so much easier for everyone around me. They do not even have to try and make friends it just comes naturally. Maybe this is just stupid but I am really tired of trying. I just do not see the point when even my own family barely supports me. I recently had major surgery and ever since that day I wish I had just died on the operating table. Because then I would not be alive struggling to be happy. I really want to give up so badly. Maybe I am also just too pathetic to kill myself anyway. I just want everything to stop, I am so exhausted. Hey, I am struggling",1
"Ever since I was a little kid I grew up thinking I was inferior. The culture I was raised in was very colorist and restrictive, and the fact my skin tone was on the darker side made me subject to all kinds of insecurity. I was indirectly programmed to believe I was not enough and that I was unattractive. My family emigrated and I grew up in a country in which I am a minority. This made it even worse. I already expected people to treat me like shit and I would not speak to people because I was almost certain that they would want nothing to do with me. Now when I look in the mirror or when somebody takes a picture of me, my entire mood/day is ruined. I feel sick and disgusted to the core. Society is incredibly hard wired to evaluate the worth of a person just by the way they look, which I guess then makes me a nobody. I have boundless, unconditional self hatred. I could not hate any entity in the universe more than I despise myself. My self hatred just continues to perpetuate itself. Everywhere I go I see beautiful ,perfect faces. Every time I check my phone. Every time I turn on the TV. Every time I go for a walk outside. I feel so disgusting and hideous compared to everybody else. I am unable to see myself in any other way. I feel as if I am undeserving of love, affection, friendship. I deserve nothing. When I see a pretty girl, I do not think about how pretty she is, but how disgusted she would be to know that a guy like me found her attractive. I isolate myself from friends and family. I sometimes ask my friends why they even want to speak to me. I want to be attractive. I want to feel confident. I want to be loved. I want to have a family and raise children and be successful. I want to be somebody else, somebody who is not me. I just want to be happy. And I never will be. Self esteem is destroying my life (rant)",0

"Idk what to do anymore, I either end it now or my life will keep spiraling down until I cannot stand it anymore and end it then. Either way I cannot handle my own emotions. Everyone says I am sensitive just for caring. The only way to feel numb is drugs or death, and deaths starting to sound better. I have been like this since I was a kid I do not think it can get better. Being alive feels like a trap. :/",1
"Never felt this doomed in my life, my gf left me 2 months ago, my mother is not really what you could call a functional person and since my rent expired I am living at her house for a few months. Friends basically disappeared. I am going to therapy but it does not really help me that much. I feel like I am going crazy and this ""truman show"" kind of place where I am living is killing me. If only I could kill myself for real Now what?",0
i will not listen to you tho if you give me advice&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;(disclaimer: i am mocking myself for reaching out to my therapist for this but not wanting to listen to her advice because i am irredeemable and i just need to die to for it all to end. i do not mean to harm anyone i just want air this lil thing out) HELP ME!

"I have been feeling better for the past month or so, but I have this feeling of dread because I know that my depression will come back, and probably harder than ever. This will most likely affect me for the rest of my life. I just wanted to know if anyone else out there feels the same way. No matter what you do, or how hard you try, your depression will always come back. Life-long depression",0
Buy your self Tea. It is amazing what it does It gave me back my motivtion. Stretch your feet and touch your toes. Avoid constant sleeping unless you are tired talk to someone to help you out. I am a Christian who has had this problom some months ago. I prayed to God about it and was delivered from it.If you feel a lack of motivation force yourself to get up and consentrate do not talk or saying anything in your head. Were ever you calm your mind down and have patients. Letting thimgs passby and lettingthe noise distract you. Hope it helps with focus. If anyone is intreastead in getting closer to God and wanting some or ask question abput my faith feel free to contact me or you can go.r/Christianity or r/PrayerTeam_amen. God bless you all. Hey wanted to give some advice to people who feel the lack of motivation and energy and feel defeatead,0

"I have been treated for my depression with trintellix and bupropion. I have been better dealing with sadness and suicidal tougth. However, I cannot seem to have motivation for anything. I have trouble getting out of bed, eating healthy, going to the gym, focusing on studying, ect. Been thinking it is maybe me or something cuz medication suppose to work. Maybe I am getting old. Does anyone have some inside so I can stop thinking I am a failure for not doing anything? Dealing with lack of motivation",0
"Never imagined posting something publicly on the internet. My depression started in my early childhood. In my family I was an unnecessary child. My twin sister always got the love from both of my parents. I swear my parents never even said ""I love you"" to me all I ever heard was ""why cannot you learn from your sister"". Even in their last day before they all died in a car crash while driving my sister to her dance lesson I remember my mothers last words were ""why do you keep wasting our time you will never achieve anything in your life"" when I accidently hit my sister with a ball while playing with our dog. After that I got adopted and my foster parents did not really care about me they just did that because they got paid for it. I was lucky to get to keep my dog because she was the only thing I had left. In school I never really had any friends I only had 1 sided friendships where I thought I had a friend but the other person did not think of me as his friend. I also got bullied in school for being adopted and being ugly. After 2 years of being adopted my dog started shaking weirdly and it was because of water in lungs some form of cancer or something I do not even know now but my foster parents took my dog away so she would not have to suffer from her incurable disease. I swear the day my dog died was the last time I had smiled in my life and it was 16 years ago. I work at a furniture factory because I was to depressed to keep studying. I worked hard everyday and then spent the rest of the day doing nothing. My apartment is always a mess because I never had a true friend that is why I never really worried about cleaning up. I always tried finding a friend during school years but I either got ignored or I became ""friends"" with people who just made me walk with them like a dog because they never talked to me and ignored my questions if I did not ask it like 10 times. People in work seem to avoid me as well but I am used to it since school years. I am now stuck in an endless cycle between work and home.The only thing I have ever wished in my life was to be loved atleast once by someone who understands me who would make me smile once more and would not ignore me like everyone else who think so fucking high of themselves. Writing this made me tear up a lot reminding me how shit life is and that the only way to fix it is by ending it. Every step I take leads me closer to suicide.",1
"its the same shit which repeats itself each fucking time, this world is so contaminated and i hate it , all of it and th way how it fucking works ?? what is the point of anythine ANYTHING AT ALL why am i here again 6 months later , writing a post ?? why the fufck am i suciidal again ?? WHY JUST WHY i just want to die in my sleep, i am done trying again and again AND I COME BACK TO THE SAME POINT WHERE I STARTED EVERY.FUCKING.TIME. no srsly tell me what is the point",1
"I tried everything. I really did. I tried to reach out to friends. To family. I tried to distract myself. I tried to love myself. But I am no good. No one loves me. I am unlovable. I told my last friend that I am struggling. She just told me we cannot be friends anymore. I tried everything. It did not work. I just wanted to be loved, by anybody. It sucks it had to be this way. But it just is. I am listening to dearly beloved from kingdom hearts. It at least is making me feel at peace with it. This is how it had to be. I will be better now. I will not be hurting. That at least makes me calm. I hope the rest of you find your light. I love you all so much. The world never loved me, but I promise, I never stopped loving it, right to the very end. I love you all so much. Take care of your hearts. I tried everything. I am sorry",1
"I have spent so long pondering why I should even stay on this Earth. I see a lot of people stay for their pets, their S/Os, their friends etc. But I do not see the point, if you have no value why burden others?

I am not staying alive for anybody or anything in particular, nothing makes me happy anymore, I might as well just kill myself right? it is not like I have anything to live for. what is even the point?",1

"I just cannot take it anymore, I am clearly addicted to it and reading to all those people make me feel like they all lost their minds even though I am an insane one here. Like, I has been really interested in politics since I was younger, and I am clearly leaning one side (left if I have to say...), but I just cannot get over the fact how there are people on both sides that are just nuts, no one wants to hear each other out on the internet and every comment section where disagreement happens becomes an all-out war, where it is impossible to convince anyone to at least consider other side or just respectfully disagree, no the goal is to absolutely obliterate your ""opponent"". I understand that some opinions perhaps should be socially ostracized, but it came to a level that everyone gets offended even if you try to be as balanced as possible, and if you have no opinion, you admit that you are not informed well enough (because apparently now everyone has a PhD in every field), etc. you becomes everyone is enemy, and it it does not only apply to politics, (as an example) I cannot enjoy anything, ""oh you wanted to eat a cake?"" be sure someone comes and tells you how unhealthy it is, oh you wanted to watch some movie? be sure someone on the internet comes and tells you that there are ""bad values"" in it, or something; I understand what they mean but you cannot live in a constant state of paranoia, where everyone is offended by something. Everything is becoming more exclusive, and every group becomes less and less inclusive. I am not saying that I am not guilty of those things, but I try to comfort myself that I try to be at least a bit self-conscious.It came to this that, when I read/watch anything on the internet that is not some funny innocent video, my mental torment becomes impossible to bear, the only thing I am constantly thinking of is smashing my head on the wall with all my might. News - pleas I hope this world will end soon; Comments - even worse. I am just scrolling, scrolling and scrolling, and with every post scrolled I just loose a tiny bit of my sanity, and when you magnify it by the number of scrolled posts, it becomes apparent that I am completely mentally deranged.And my depression usually, simply, makes me unable to do anything else then scroll this god forsaken web, because I do not really get satisfaction from anything, and this internet stockholm syndrom makes me feel at home with this psychic torture.tl;dr - the internet is just a toxic place that I cannot escape.I do not know if it is even a good place to post it (and I will probably delete it, like I usually do...), but it seems like this subreddit is rather friendly, and I apologize for this rant but I wanted to vent out, maybe find comfort if someone feels the same... The Internet is driving me crazy",0

"I am a caregiver for my mom and I have helped her since I was 12. I want to help her because I know she cannot do stuff alone but I cannot take a day off. there is always something I have to do and I am exhausted. I do love her but I just cannot take it anymore. My therapist suggested moving out since I am 18 but I just cannot. I feel selfish and feel like there is no reason to move out. Also, I know if I move out my mom will find me so we can amend things. My therapist and I have tried to find ways for services but she cannot get on them because of social security points or money. I have been trying to fix the relationship but I feel like there is always something wrong. Not on her but me. If I do not do this, I am selfish. If I take a break or want to do something I feel like I could be cleaning this or helping her with that. We argue because I am not cleaning this now or doing this later. I am tired. I have told her many times I want help but for some reason she always wants help from boyfriends. I do not care anymore but anytime I try to find a solution all it leads me to is killing myself. I feel hopeless and I just want a break. My therapist said if she should help me move out or find a way to feel better about this and I do not know what to do. I do not want to move out but I do not feel like I could feel better about the situation I am in. I am sorry if I am all over the place but i did not want to make this post any longer.

"**So this might be a very weird title, and probably an even weirder story but I am going to share it with you anyway:**Since 2018 I have been a big fan of a band, Iron Maiden. You might have heard of them since they are pretty popular. I started listening to this band when I was still in school and decided to go to a concert with my dad which originally would take place in the summer on 2019. Now with the corona and all it got postponed to the summer of 2022 already. As of late I feel like I might be obsessed with Iron Maiden, maybe in a good way but not necessarily. I love their music very much, seen every DVD and love to read interviews and stories about them. Iron Maiden helped me through a tough time last year when someone very close to me got hospitalised with Covid-19 and almost died because of it. Luckily that person survived and is still with us, which I am grateful for every day of my life&amp;#x200B;But now the reason why I wanted to share my story in this subreddit: Iron Maiden are a very old band. they have been going since the 80's already and their oldest member is 69 at the moment. I have only become a fan of them in 2018 meaning I missed out on so much. I could not have been there since the beginning since I was born in 1998. But the things I missed make me feel miserable. The great journeys the band had, the amazing adventures they went on and I missed it all.To add to this, they announced a new album coming in September 2021, the 17th album to be exact. Rejoice you would say right? Well, wrong. I feel very sad and would almost call it depressed. I hardly sleep and I cannot find fun in the little things anymore like playing a game or going on trips with my girlfriend. Every time I read something about Iron Maiden or watch a video/ DVD I get so sad since they are at the end of their career and I have only been there for such a short while. I want to be so excited for the upcoming album and support the band on perhaps their last tour but I just cannot.I know this probably all sounds very stupid and you are probably scratching your heads on why I make such a big deal out of this. And to be perfectly honest, I am wondering the same thing. I feel so stupid that I feel this way but I do not know what I can do to stop it. The realisation that my favourite band might quit in a few years is something I cannot accept.My girlfriend nor my parents do not really seem to get it either. They know I am an avid Iron Maiden fan but they do not get why I am so sad when talking about the end of their career. it is not like they make fun of me for feeling this way, it is just like they think it is weird that it means so much to me. I sometimes think I might be autistic since it bothers me this much.&amp;#x200B;I do not know if there is any advice that would help me, but I wanted to share my feelings right here. Iron Maiden will always stay with me but I am so afraid that I might fall in a very deep depression once they announce the end and that is something I do not want. I have a beautiful girlfriend with whom I plan to have children in the future and grow old together. I cannot let them down because of something like this but I am so scared it is going to happen..... I feel like I am depressed because of my favourite band",0
that is all it really feels like at this point but I do not want to wait anymore. it is going to happen eventually but I wish it would happen now. I am sorry to my parents. I am just waiting to die,1
"Here I am unable to sleep because I have to take what is the biggest test of my life tomorrow and I have not studied at all for it of course. I know I am going to fail and then probably lose my job offer after. I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago but did not have the guts to do it like every other time I have tried. I was there, on the edge of a bridge ready to jump but I was just too afraid when it came down to it (I am terrified of surviving it and then living with the consequences after). If I fail this test I am surely going to try to commit suicide again but I know myself at this point, I will not really do it so this post is pointless. I have had depression basically my whole life, I have no friends, barely talk to my family, everyday is just frustrating agony. I wish something horrible would happen to me and end it all so I would not have to waste another minute in this disgusting worthless existence. Taking the NCLEX tomorrow and then probably my life",1
"I have been depressed for a very long time. I have known nothing but heartache, failure, rejection, misfortune... I had hoped after everything I have been through I would be happier by now. I am 29 and nothing makes me happy. I have lost interest in everything. I could write a book on all of the bad things I have been through. Awful things. But I digress... I have only ever been in one real relationship and I was a rebound the entire time. I was blind to it and I felt true love for that person. I would have done anything for him. I thought he would, too. But I realized I was sorely mistaken. Before that relationship and ever since, no one has taken me seriously. I have been sexually assaulted (that is how I lost my virginity), or I have been used. No one is genuine anymore. My degree, that I worked so hard to earn, is useless. I still live with my parents. I have no peace at home. I have no peace at either one of my two jobs. I try to do coursework to prepare for grad school, but I know I cannot afford grad school. I try to volunteer at the Red Cross, but I live 30 minutes away from the closest center and the volunteer times conflict with my work time. I thought working on myself and learning to love myself would make me much happier and more resilient to the many obstacles I constantly run into. Anything I try to do is somehow 100x more difficult than it should be.I feel like I will never be independent, have a job that pays me enough to support myself, find a significant other that understands me and does not use me, have a family of my own... I do not see anything in my future. Just scraping pennies and surviving without privacy, intimacy, nothing. I have been thinking about ending my life since my last relationship fell apart. I do not see the value of my life anymore. I am not happy. I do not know if I ever will be. And I have only come this far because I failed once, and because it would devastate my mother. I have thought very seriously about buying a gun. Driving to a remote area and just ending it there. A friend of mine did just that two years ago. No one ever saw it coming. But I have been practically screaming it for the world to see in social media posts and displaying obvious signs of suicidal ideations. No one seems to see it, or care. I think my mother is the only person who would be genuinely hurt. I cannot hurt her, but living for someone else's comfort is even more painful. I cannot do this anymore.I am probably going to wait until I see my long distance friends in October, but before my 30th birthday. Christine Chubbuck was 29. I have not wanted to live for a long time. And I think I am getting closer to ending it.",1
"Wanting a relationship but being out of shape( working on that), ugly and no personality or real talents as well as poor means I am shit out of luck! 26 years old and i have never spent a night with a woman.

I had a crazy few days where I feel like I cannot win then I just opened a cherry jolly rancher and it dropped on the floor of the car then I looked in the pack and realized that was the last cherry one and it was just a down moment that summed up a series of tough moments and I felt like ok I get it this is my Ls I got to take in sequence and then I turned my iPhone light in and realized a watermelon was a cherry so I got one blessings to you all its always there you just got to find it I have been going through it but think I see a way out,0
"Do you know the saying 'dead inside' that is kind of how I feel, I just do not care about anything anymore, I just want out, I want to be able to go to parties and not feel like I do not belong, I want to be able to sleep, I want to be happy, or at least I want to be able to smile for real instead of faking it all the time. I accidentally cut myself the other day, and I did not mind the pain, yeah it hurt, but, I did not care, and that is just scary, I am not going to start cutting myself on purpose any time soon but the fact that I did not even give a second thought to the inch deep cut that is now on my hand, is way to terrifying to think about, I do not know what to do.

"Lately I am been going through almost daily battling depression and I am not sure how to fix it. I would say I have had major depression (not medically diagnosed) for about 2 months now, but its been slowly growing over the course of 6 months when I could still function. I moved from East to West coast of the US and thought I would be fine when I moved. However the past 2 months of living alone has been extremely tough on me.I have days where I have some semblance of ""normalcy"" where I can cook/prepare meals, clean, etc (do stuff I need to). But most days as of lately are just me sulking about my life situation and I barely have enough energy to even get out of bed or stand up. So its those odd days that still keep me going. Overall I have been having incredible feelings of **dread**, **hopelessness**, and **aimlessness**.**Dread** because I have had this idea in my head of how I want to live my life, but nothing is the way I want it. After college I wanted to move abroad and live in an rural foresty area. But, currently I still live in the US and live in an urban desert (Arizona). I strongly feel like I **do not belong here** but I accepted the job anyways since I need experience out of college. I hate cities, hate the heat, and hate driving; all things I have to deal with.**Hopelessness** because I have many things I want to do and improve on. But cannot get myself to do them; creating an endless cycle of berating myself. I distract myself with YouTube, video games, and talking with friends; which makes me temporarily happy but when I stop and realize where I am, I just break down.**Aimlessness** because I do not know what to do with myself. Even though I am working in a company that has nice and helpful co-workers/managers; I just do not care about the work and am only planning to stay here for 3 years to get experience. However, the 2 months I have been here the longer days feel. I thought I would make friends at work but am not putting in effort in making them, and so put myself in a lonely situation.I tried looking for therapy after I got insurance from my company but all have waiting lists since they are completely booked. I still apply anyways but am not hopeful for any help coming soon. Depression Worsening but feel lost on to fix it",0

"I tried to kill myself via overdose. It was stupid and even though Id been planning on doing it a few days it was terribly organised, desperate and last minute. I find myself lately thinking of ordering proper equipment online to commit suicide when I have the opportunity in a cleaner sort of more comfortable way. I honestly do not want to think like this but I am stuck in this rut I cannot get out of and I am not coping at all without thoughts of the future and how bleak and impossible everything looks. I have cut loads of people out and minimised contact for the past several years. I do not know if I have just been doing that because I want less people to hurt or it takes me too much energy or what. I do not feel I think too clearly about things like that. Sometimes it is easier having no one and keeping everything to yourself because people cannot be trusted. I feel worried about what will come of my failed suicide attempt.

Nothing , i realize that so many people die and died in past we are just very little tiny part of time gap , why we live if there is death and after that nothing , why just do not die at this moment nothing going to change , I even do not take try to hustle for waking up in morning and again go to sleep , I mostly sleep when there is no work or lectures , i am not sucidal but if someone puts gun on my head i will just be happy and smile at that moment Not sucidal but definitely something feel like nihilism",1
"I am not sure that this is the right place to do this sorry if it is not. Also sorry for bad english in advance it is been a long time since i talked to anyone and in addition i am german.I am 25/m and my first Girlfriend left me in April after 7 1/2 years. She told me ""I am going to find someone better"" and she is right. I live in my mom's basement. I never had a job, i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to, just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been ""beaten"". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for ""not wanting help"" because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk. No one that cares except about my financials which is all my mom ever cared about besides her work. I cannot stay awake during day and i cannot sleep at night. I will never be happy again. I will never enjoy anything.All i can think of is that death seems to be the only way out...I would at least like to talk to someone again and just not be alone...It would be nice to not be ignored once. I just got this urge to tell someone everything about me. I hope i will not regret this.",0

But I had already died inside. This sounds so dramatic but it is the best description of things. Anyone around me can see this. Not like anyone would actually care, they probably think I have some mental retardation. Honestly, I probably do. I have not progressed much since then. My personality has not changed significantly, I have not experienced much, anything I did experience felt dull. Like, alcohol. It just raises my heart beat and makes it hard to walk. Or sex, it is nice, but the same way as food is nice. It does not give any meaning to my life. The only exception is mdma, the only thing that has made me feel something in ten years. But anyways, I really just feel like a ghost. Maybe I am, who knows. It would explain a lot of things. I am really just a she will of a person. Like, sorry, I do not mean to one up anyone on depression. But when I hear stories of people that are depressed and just play online games all day or watch netflix, youtube etc. It just reminds me how fucked up I am. Because I have to FORCE myself to do any of those things. Anything that is not lying in bed all day, maybe scrolling through reddit to distract myself. I do not feel like continuing writing this. But anyways, if I did not have a loving mother I would have ended this by now. there is nothing else keeping me here. Anyone other than my mum will do just fine when I am gone. I did not make a difference in anyone's life after all. I have been selfish, only thinking about my feelings and letting anxiety keep me from doing anything good Trapped in this fucking existence because ""mum would be sad""",0
Sleeping is not as fun anymore. it is just a time travel to another day of agony. Another day of intense suicidal and intrusive thoughts. Intense anxiety. No one to make me feel worthy since I am annoyingly codependent and cannot do it for myself.Sleeping just means I will wake up. And waking up means I suffer once again Scared to sleep. Scared to wake up.,1
"You want to off yourself, I want to off myself... let us keep each other okay for a bit. I do not want to die I just do not want to he here anymore. I have made the most gut wrenching choice of my life so far and its killing me every day since. I have lost my entire support system and have no where to turn. I need to talk to someone. Anyone. And maybe if you are reading this you might need someone to offload on, too. Maybe we can distract each other with our respective woes. Maybe we can help each other make it through the rest of the day.Anyway. I am here. you are here. let us talk. Commiserating Buddy",1
"i still remember how clear it is. i cut myself in the bathroom stall and it was spreading blood all over.i remember everyone panicking while i was in shock and the stares i got. sometimes i wish i would have just died there, just to simply disappear. the day it happened",1
"1) In 2011 my best friend passed away in a bike accident at that time my age was around 15.That incident really affected my mental health badly and now still after 10 years i am really depressed about that thing.2) I wanted to become a Professional Football Player but tbh i never gave my 100% and after my friends death i started to stay at home and made my house comfort zone.Lost contact with all my friends and with the girl i loved(My First Love)3) Talking about my First Love i first saw her in 2005 and i had little bit of family drama with her family also where her parents came to know about the thing i liked/loved there daughter.Her Mother was nice and just because i was a kid my age was probably 11-12 she said this is not the age to do love and these kind of things there is proper age for these kind of things.I apologized to my crush on fb and she did forgive me.After almost 1-2 years we became friends but there was a problem my one frnd was now her bf and they both were in a relationship.At that time i accepted the fact that with my crush the only relationship i am going to have is of friendship and nothing else.But somewhere deep inside i felt when we became friends and got to know each other personally she liked me but was waiting for me to make a move.4) In April 2021 while having a chat with my friend i get to know my First Love/Crush got pregnant and had done abortion recently.That news really fucked my mind up,i feel really bad for her bcoz her behaviour towards me was very nice she did forgive me and when i made the move for friendship she accepted me without any hesitation.5) I have health issues(Asthma and Diabetes) and my doctor has recommended to start exercising.Having Asthma was one of the reason why i gave up on my dream of becoming Professional Football Player.6) I have been having suicidal thoughts from past 2 years but now i feel universe is trying to help me in achieving my goals and trying to help me in my love life by giving news of First Love being Pregnant and Abortion.Doctor advising to start exercising i can take these things as positives and work on building and achieving my dream of being Professional Football Player i know it is bit late in terms of age for starting a career in sports but i want to give atleast one try for the things which i loved and that is Football and my First Love.I do not want die having regrets.7) there is a huge 10 year communication gap between me and my First Love because after 2011 after my best friend's death i made my home comfort zone.I have cried after hearing the news of her Pregnancy and Abortion i just want to talk with her and see her.I am not in a hurry of becoming her bf first i want heal/help her mental health/career wise.I want to marry her.But because we have huge communication gap i fear does she remember me.8) I have planned few things to make her remember times of us being friends and tell her my love feelings through it (Like for eg:- About the day when i saw her for the very first time) editing pictures(Written in story format and cartoon) and video edit (Stop Motion Video).But first i am going to try and build a bond with her like we had 10 years ago and i have plans to help her by giving her tips for growing her business and then i am going to express my love feelings towards her tbh from last 15 years she knows that i love her it is just i have never confessed my love to her face to face.( Please do not tag me as a creepy guy i have written everything what i really feel) ( Big Sorry for my Bad English i tried my best any Advice would be welcomed ) Life is trying to give me a second chance.Should I try my luck ? (Thanks In Advance)",1

"I do not want to live anymore. I am 16 and everything in my life, sucks.My parents have been divorced for years, we moved across countries, my father started a new family and when he heard that I do not see his family as my family he sent me off to a therapist. I have got absolutely no support in anything, from anyone. When I grow up, I want to be a musician, but my parents do not like that Idea at all. They also play the victim card on me all the time, and when I confront them about their parenting they turn it around on me. sorry this is so messy, I could get into much of this stuff, I just know no one cares and has the time to read so much. I just do not want to continue living. I am so tired of trying. there is no point, in anything. I have never felt this way in my life, but there is just no getting around it.1 day ago I was about to kill myself, when I realised I do not want to. And truth is, I do not want to die, i just do not want to live anymore, I do not know if anyone understands what I am saying. I just want time to freeze forever. I am out of options, I do not know what to do. I am posting this here because, why the f not, and I have never even talked about this to anyone. I mean, I talk about stuff like this with my therapist, but, I do not even have motivation to keep on going to him. it is probably due to my family saying that only weak people go to therapists and that I do not need him... But they are the ones who sent me to the therapist??I know this is like, really bad writing, but I do not know anymore. Through my life I have had so many issues, and always tried to face them, but without any motivation from anyone around me, I just do not know what to do. I am incredibly sad. I just do not want to.",0
In the last 3/4 years it was been difficult for me to be comfortable in a group of people because I am always the person with few friends and one of the few without having a relationship with someone. This thing started to affect me mentally because in high school I was barely invited to my friends parties and group activities without any reason and in college I had some bad moments with my colleagues that made change of course (but I was not feeling well in that course too). Then I had a crush in a girl but she did not want anything with me and never gave me attention to me while I was trying to be friendly with her. There were times I felt a completely incompetent and very depressed because I never felt what was being loved by someone and being included in a group of friends that wanted to do something with me. My social life is making me feel depressed,0
"So i was just minding my business at the trainstation, waiting for my train to go to scchool after a stressful morning at my workplace. It was around midday and it was raining badly, i just sat down on a bench near me and tuned into some music when suddenly this old lady just sat down next to me and started talking to me""So.. weekend now, huh?"" She asked me. I put down my headphones and replied with ""not really, still have to work a shift on saturday."" I really was not interested to chit-chat with her so i hastily put my headphones back on, or atleast tried to. Before i actually put them on she said ""Ah, school. Which grade are you in?"" I quickly replied again ""grade 10"" before she turned her head to me and smilingly said ""You have a great future ahead of you!"" ""I doubt that but thank you."" i said back. There was a small moment of silence but the old lady eventually broke it with her words ""You know.. you need to stop troubling yourself with the past. you are young and strong, there is no need for you to worry about a tiny fraction of your life, which is the past. Start focusing on the future.. better yet, yout future! Forget your age and focus on your future because only you can shape it the way you want. do not try and change the past because it already solidified into your life but your future on the other hand.. If i were you, I would use your young strength and willpower to shape a future that would suit me right. I would give allot just to go back in time and tell my young self everything I have just told you because i know i could have done better than i actually did. If i did better in the past then maybe now i would not have to take the train to my last days of work everyday, haha. Well, here goes my train.. take care of yourself, okay darling?""With those words she entered the train and waved goodbye to me. I had abusive parents so i never got such advice and honestly it felt magical to hear something like that. I just needed to share this with someone and hopefully this advice will help some of you on here like it helped me.Keep on going you all! Had a small-talk with an old lady at the trainstation today.",0

"I grew up in an extremely abusive and neglectful home with narcissistic parents. To say that I was constantly criticized, mocked, judged, and degraded would be an absolute understatement. I went no-contact roughly a year ago and have been trying to heal and work through my trauma. On paper, it would seem as if I am doing pretty damn well. I am 18 years old, a full-time college student at a great university, working full-time, completely on my own financially, and living in a big city. I have made the Dean's list every semester, work as a youth mentor for formerly homeless youth, and I am in a five-year social work master's program to get my BSW and MSW and become a clinical therapist. Despite all of these things I have going for me, I feel like I am drowning. I am completely physically and mentally exhausted from the toll that 18 years of abuse, chaos, and stress has taken on me. I deal with chronic suicidality and extreme internalized shame. My default is viewing myself as a defective, bad, worthless, embarrassing human being. With everything I do, these thoughts completely infiltrate my mind. It stops me from doing the things I want to out of fear of judgement and criticism. it is like I constantly fear the possibility that everyone else will see what I see. I feel like I have exhausted all of my options and I simply do not know what to do anymore. I have seen multiple therapists, psychiatrists, journaled, meditated, done yoga, said affirmations, listened to podcasts, read books about healing, tried 10+ different medications for depression, PTSD, anxiety, and have even gotten ketamine-infusions for treatment-resistant depression and suicidality. And yet, I still feel like at my core, everything is so pointless. I want to be able to wake up without wanting to die. Any advice or support would be so greatly appreciated, as I am having a really tough time right now. Advice or support for chronically suicidal 18 year old",1

"My life is fine, I am pretty lucky actually, but I can stop feeling utterly miserable, bored and alone. there is nothing to do and I cannot bring myself to do anything. Anytime I start something, I always want to stop after a couple of weeks. This has been going on for as long as I can remember. I wish I could just maintain an interest in something. I feel left out and unable to connect with others too. I just feel so trapped. I am just so unhappy. I have tried so hard to change it, but I always have this cloud hanging over me.

"I am writing this while drinking a bottle of wine while crying and as the title says, i think I have instantly hit rock bottom, i thought i could not get any lower, when you try to come out about my depression here i am. I am planning on killing myself soon but i just felt i needed to put this.I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts, the notion of wanting to not have been born feels natural. I think it started when i was 4 and getting beat and locked up in a storeroom at home and getting bullied in school.One of my first memories was of my older sister getting dragged to the storeroom to be locked up while I stood there crying, thinking back, this might have been the first time i disassociated from reality i still remember how it felt like i had no control over my body just watching the movie play out. I try to pretend like those two years do not bother me but it does. I can still clearly see flashes of those 2 years and i hate it.There were about 3 points in my life where i resolved to kill myself: When i was 5, where a kid who was bullying me bit me on the face for using the toilet before he did and i was blamed by the school for starting the fight, i remember that was the first time i seriously thought of ending it, nobody would believe me because his friend said i started it. This was the first time you locked me in my room and looked out the window of my apartment and thought long about jumping. Eventually, i pussied out and i blanked out for a long time after that, i cannot even remember what happened after that it felt like memory only resumed after i saw my abuser get punished at 6 years old.The second time i resolved to unexist was when i was put into a school far away from my home, i knew no one there and as a person who is bad at talking i naturally got bullied, my already shitty health got worst, i had terrible stomach pains particularly in the morning, i was afraid to leave my home. My books were glued, table vandalized, i felt the whole class was against me. Then one day when a guy was pouring water on my table I snapped, i think i had my first anxiety attack, i pulled his arm hard thinking of smashing his face in, but then I instantly started crying, i felt intense fear, my heart was beating out of whack I felt like everyone was laughing at me, i could not breathe, my stomach churning, and my mind went blank. My teacher talked to me after class but at that point, I have fully disassociated I do not think i heard anything i just went ok for everything. I started skipping more classes feeling like my room was the only safe place, i fell asleep almost every night crying about how big a disappointment i was to my parents, how useless i am, i have no talenfs, i was only a burden on everyone, the only thing i deserved was to die. i was planning to do so but once again i pussied out my useless urge to live won out, because a man on youtube saved my life, he was a comedian from sourcefed at that time, his name was Steve Zaragoza when i was 13 he was pretty much what was keeping me alive with sourcefed table talks, and what he said i think pretty much saved my life, he said the stopped getting bullied because he became the funny kid. So i became the funny kid, i started craving attention, everyone liked me, i was the goofy fucker, one of the class clowns, but that was only temporary.The urge to end it lessened and i soon started going to the gym.I was getting better. I was at 105Kg (about 200lbs) back then and through out 2 years i lost about 30Kg ( about 65lbs). I thought that at that point i would feel happier and more confident i would become OK, but it did not the thoughts at the back of my head still remained. i went off the diet and i gained back all the weight by the time 6 monthes passed, every though i ate normally, this shit just made me give up hope losing weight.The third time in the past i tried to end it was when i was in 2018 (at about 17 and 18 years old) , i went into the school i wanted; the school and course my parents wanted i thought i was happy my sense of self worth was at its peak and i thought i had made my whole family proud being the topp 10%, but of course again i was wrong i could not handle the pressure of my course, i coundn't wrap my head around the subjects taught and from that pressure i decidedd to run away i skipped my, classes, my exams, dropped ou, planned to work for a while go on holiday and then end it after the holiday settleing some loose ends. I Planned to die, did not decide the method this time but it was what i felt was rock bottom. I never tried to tell anyone besides as disgusing it as a joke to friends, never said anything to to family, or to any doctors i just kept it to myself, because i thought no one deserves to be burdened by my shit and i was embarrassed and scaredBut i think the reason i did not kill myself was my niece, i watched over her often as my sister was working and her father was a piece of fucking shit. I felt like i was her father i felt like i had to be there for her, i did not want her to have a shitty shildhood, i wanted her to grown up healthy and sane.Turns out i was ok with working i enjoyed my time talking to customers, the pay was enough, for me, and i felt like my life was amounting to something i felt sort ok and then covid came knocking and the lock down began. The lockdown brough my family closer, i soon had a nephew too and felt responsible for him soon after. I wanted to be there for them. I want them to be fuckin normal people unlike me me. I wad happy for a whiel.Now brings us to current times, lockdown is over, i was conscripted into the military like every other man in our ountry. I went through my 1 month basic trainig thinking, i would get a job that would let me go home everyday like a 9 to 5, but i did not, i had to stay in a military camp from sunday night to friday, i cannot see my familt, the thoughts were getting more and more frequent and i after just a few weeks of staying here the feeling of it feels stronger and stronger, but i could not just leave my friend to handle everything, so i endured for a while.Yesterday at the military doctors office i just blurted out my anxious feelings and some outher shit that i could not put into words properly and he asks me to come back later but with my superiors and 2 other random guys in the office, i choked while they accused me of lying and lectured me about growing up and just deal with it while i was too nervous, i could not form a sentence, through the doctor saying why i did not highlight the issue to previous doctors, it did not make sense for me to say it now. I fully disassociated. I did not cry i just agreed with what they said like it was the truth, i had once again truly decidded to kill myself after 3 years.The first time i try to tell anyone about my issue did not belive me and instead put me through a interrogation, discredited and berated me the entire time. I have hit even lower than what i thought was possible.There is no hope, there is no meaning, i should not exist. My life has ni value. My wine is done and my drugs are in me hopefully this is my last day. Also sorry about the errors and long post. Good afternoon good evening and goodnight. Instantly pushed to rock bottom",1
"Nowadays, my friends, it is hard to find the warrior spirit anymore. People have forgotten. It is indeed too much to ask for a ""noble because"" to die for. We immerse ourselves in pleasures and delights that do not give us the long awaited glory. We have been enslaved, broken, bent. I do not want to die an old frail man into this absurd circus that the world has become. Me and a few left still have the old spirit. But to die at war nowadays is not what it once was. We die for politicians that do not care for us. For the rich. If it was for me, I would put them all to the sword. I want to die. But first, I need to achieve glory. But what is glory nowadays? What do we worship? What do we do when confronted by this question? Sex? Worthless temporary pleasure. Drinking and taking drugs? Temporary, again. What unites are an action? What is the utmost answer to these pathetic clowns that they throw at us? This day and age, I cannot die for my country as I do not believe in it nowadays, even if I do believe in our spirit. I will have to end it all in some years, before I reach full ""maturity"". I will die. I will die, indeed. I crave for death so much. But still. There are things to do, still, in this world.

"Hi guys I am a 18F and I feel like I am falling back into a state of depression. I feel like part of it is because it is summer break so I feel like I have nothing productive to do. Throughout the day I am just in a constant state of sadness although idk if it would be considered depression. I sometimes find myself thinking about death even though I am not necessarily suicidal. I do not really have the motivation to do anything productive and just laze around all day until its night time when I usually play games with my friends. This gives me some joy but then after it is done I fall back into that sad state. I feel like I have no one to talk to because I feel like I do not deserve to be depressed or sad. I do not have any financial struggles and I have a pretty good relationship with family and friends. I am hoping that once fall semester starts I will be out of this rut and instead be stressed about school LOL. Anyways, thank you to anyone that actually reads this and listened to my rant :).

I do not want to be here anymore.I really tried to turn things around I tried to make things better but no matter what I do I just feel like I am suffocating while everyone watches. I have been feeling like this for seven fucking years and I am so fucking tired. In those seven years I have tried to kill myself multiple times which did not exactly work out for me. I just want everything to stop. I just want to close my eyes and to never wake up again. I do not want to remember shit anymore. I do not want to have to feel like this anymore. I do not want to have to try and cope with shit and convince myself that I can handle just one more day anymore. I am so fucking tired.

It sounds so nice. Screw my family getting sad or something -- I will not even be there to grieve about the sadness I caused them because I am 6 feet under. Honestly, at this point I am so tired of keeping up with everything. I am tired of forcing myself to manage my emotions all the time.

To have something to look forward to in life?Really, I am just going through the motions now -- and I am sick. I am so so sick and tired.

"I do not know what I am going to write here. I just need to express my dumb ugly thoughts. I kept hitting myself I the head this not ing, I have been crying ever night and morning lately, and it hurts physically Anxiety has taken a hold of me.

But how can I be confident, I cannot. I am hideous, like a clown. I am horny but I cannot possibly imagine someone wanting to be with me physically.So I work, and it is exhausting, and when I am done for the day I lay down to recover, and when I am done, I have to get ready for work again.I do not have the time or energy to invest in improving my life, because I have to work, you do not hate working I just, it is tiring. And I am losing touch with the thing used to like to do.I have no time, so self live, no sex, no lovers, no time to get it togther. And you can feel myself coming apart.I am dying, choked to death on unresolved emotions, other humans comments, sweet dreams and a mirror that makes me cry.Someone hold me, hold me tight and whisper. ""I got you"" just for an hour, just for a moment, someone else, please hold me togther and see my crying pain. Becoming undone alone in the shadows is being choked under water screaming A mushy splashy brain sauce",1

"I do not want to live with my abusive mom anymore. I am 18 but I cannot literally stand on my own because I was forced to live in a strict rules. I do not want to live with my abusive mom anymore. I have two choices. I either kill her or kill myself. I do not want to be a bad person. I want to know what is the least painful and easiest way to commit suicide. (I know some people will come and try to comfort me to prevent suicide. I appreciate that. But, man, think about it. Sometimes, words cannot solve the problems. It will just postpone the problems. And there are moments when you get in troubles and do not get the actual help but comforting words.) What is the least painful and easiest way to commit suicide?",1
"I do not know why I do not have a good reason, maybe its because I am pretty isolated but theoretically things should be looking up for me but I have never felt more like I wanted to hurt and bleed and make stupid dangerous choices. I want to hug someone who cares about me and I just want to know what my purpose is. I am very very tired and I am trapped inside of my own house my own head and the past actions people did to me and I cannot get out of it and I fucking wish I could I want to get out I am feeling so out of it and low",1
"22m. I have always battled depression, never has been this bad. I have 0 friends I can talk to, I am too nervous how my parents will react if I try to seek help. I just hate everything about myself. I hate how I look, how I talk, how I act, and especially how I think. I feel like I am just spectating my life, and I have zero control. they say life goes fast but this life sentence is taking forever. when will my time be done? Trying to escape",0
"My mothers emotional abuse, my fathers neglect, the sexual assault, the unrelenting bullying, the inability to make friends, the overwhelming depression and anxiety all of these caused me to miss out on both my childhood and teen years. I wish I could start over because I already fucked up. I am now 19 and I did not get to experience so much. I have no dreams, no aspirations, only regrets about what I could not do.

"I have called the suicide hotline three times in my life. All three of those times, though through no fault of the caller, I have felt less listened to and heard than if I were to just ramble to my friends or internet strangers.'Active/Reflexive listening' is a good tool when people use it correctly, but what I have been met with when calling has been the basic 'I hear _' or 'you sound ___'. Yes, I appreciate your insight, but I do not need to be told my feelings when I want to slit my wrists while listening to my favorite songs as I black out from loss of blood. Does anybody else have this problem of eye-rolling when trying to seek help? I feel so selfish and frustrated at the same time. I have a therapist, but manic depression prevents me from caring about my meetings. I force myself to log on, put on a smile, and try to be insightful about my problems until nobody's eyes are on me again and I can take off my mask of mental health again into the faceless being I seem to be identifying with more and more. I am just so tired of everything. I am tired of human interaction in general. I do not know how to keep my energy as it and most of my positivity ends up jumping ship as soon as it can. I am tired of putting on a strong face and of bottling up all of this overdue crying I do not let myself experience. Once upon a time I would have loved to hear a friendly 'everyone fucks up, it will be okay' but now I do not want to hear anything. I want to lock myself up and stare at the ceiling. I want to impose prison time on myself so that I am less responsible for a life I do not care about. I do not want my corpse to be found. that is the most honest reason for not dying already. My family's reaction. My sister's disappointment when she is dealt with this as well. But, I do just not want to wake up. I want a heat seeking one person disintegration missile comet type thing to just do its thing.I will probably call the hotline tonight and roll my eyes again. Pushing away positive changes as I always do. Ignoring things I do not want to hear. Pretending the past is not the curse tainting any chance at happiness because I was afraid to try. Taking solace in the fact that we all eventually disappear. Meanwhile browsing tiktok lives to get noticed by strangers and attain a slight bit of validation that will end up disappearing in the air like all of those exhales after smoking - anything to numb my head and my body. I want to let myself cry, but I am worried I will never stop at this point. I am alone. Truly. But we all are. Not sure of the point of this post now as the walls of dissociation come back up. Thank you for reading. Thank you for still breathing. Thank you for being a part of this community and being vulnerable. The Suicide Hotline and Other Selfish Rants",1
"I have been on a waiting list for trauma therapy after years of complete dysfunction and depression. Today, my last local friend made it very clear that they did not really want to spend time with me anymore. They were the last person on my safety plan. I no longer have any friends or family who really care if I kill myself.But hey, the social workers in the ER assure me that outpatient care is the gold standard and it is totally a good thing that my state has no residential inpatient mental Healthcare. Right before telling me I need to put five people on a safety plan to help ensure I am safe. Relying on friends for emotional support has destroyed every single friendship I had.

I do not think I have depression and it is strange that I am on my summer holiday so I cannot see what is the stressor?

"You know, I read through this sub sometimes and kind of compare what I think to other peoplesThe intrusive thoughts that I have are mostly because of the fact that I think too much, I guess.I do not get suicidal thoughts because of a dude, or family, or feeling low because of my own disappointments. I look at the world and I see how dark and empty it has become. Like the bad things are outweighing the good, and its not even worth going through troubles of living for it anymore.I used to be joyful. I am talking small excitements and everything. And then BAM, reality happenedBeing sad is okay. You can deal with it and move on, eventually. Being numb is not. Maybe some would agree on this one. Sometimes i ask myself, if you could wipe your memories, would you still think like this?I still do not know the solid answer to that, but I think it has a pointBut hey!

Nuke my little world and all the trauma I have been through.I have been lying to my small circle of loved ones that I am fine but I am super not fucking okay. I have seen a lot of blood. I have lost friends to suicide. I was mentally/emotionally abused at home, bullied outside of home as a child. I have been used over and over and OVER My own mother decided to sweep my sexual and psychological abuse from my ex boyfriend under the rug. Why? Because she is fucking his dad!!! And so i had to run away before i was ready for the world. I am almost TWENTY. I have no fucking clue how to budget. cannot clean to save my life. do not even know how to pay bills- My roommate and boyfriend help me do that. I was homeless for six months because of her. Because if i had stayed in that god damn house any longer i would have ended it.Money this, money that.Every little thing now makes me more miserable.So, SO tired of my bank. Arvest sucks, the way they process transactions so they can make money off overdraft fees is criminal. My apartment building shut off my water without any kind of warning yesterday because they apparently were fixing something (its back now but NO WARNING) I am almost 100 in the hole (after being so good about avoiding it, but i had to buy groceries), and my fiance, bless his heart, is having to cover my stupid ass on rent AGAIN because i cannot get enough hours at work to save my life. I am hunting for a second job (because i thought a freaking restaurant job would make more money than i do now!! I am so dumb!! I had to leave walmart because i was constantly in the hospital and/or sick and it was killing me!) and its really screwing with my anxiety. Hell literally be flat broke after bills, because he has to pay his phone bill that he put off...because I could not pay it. I have no parental figures that are in my life that i can ask for help without getting lectured. (I do not trust them much anyway but...that is a LONG story. Really long.)Which means we will not be able to get a cheap-o ac unit that we desperately need this check (because our electric is insanely expensive right now because were having to run three fans to keep my lungs from chucking a hissy and to keep my fiances asthma somewhat under control) , or anything else, like a pair of work boots that said fiance needs for his new job.I am tired of constantly struggling.

Spoke to legal advice, my solicitor, UK a helplines and more. Charges are serious, will require multiple magistrate and crown court dates (I attended on magistrate court once, that cage they put you in gave me an instant fucking panic attack), solicitors and a barrister (wtf that is, it looks like a solicitor that costs more). They could only go by guidelines but at BEST its around 3 to 6 years insidetldrm; I am fucked. I barely have the money for the first solicitor let alone the barrister (even with legal aid). I am a trans woman, who spent their teenage life being heavily bullied to the point of PTSD (hence the police banging on windows and yelling throws me directly into a panic attack) and prison is terrifying I have exhausted options. I either run (which is dumb), go to prison after subjecting myself to court anxiety nightmares again, or I leave By my own means.&amp;#x200B;the latter is the preferable choice.

I feel bad for wanting to die since I have my siblings and mother still here. I have been planning different methods. The most recent plan is to buy a shit ton of eyedrops and sleeping medicine and take them at a hiking trail by a cave so people cannot see me.

"I feel I am not giving it enough time. I feel my prayers have been answered. I moved out of my abusers house. It was bliss for 2 weeks but there was lapses of desires to hurt myself or worse. Today is one f those days. I keep praying, I am not religious but its the only time I can let myself cry, and it feels my prayers do get answered. But why have I not been given anybody else to help me through my sorrows? Does the universe truly want me to brave this myself? I do not know how to begin even. I meditate and journal, every single day, and it does not matter when nobody knows what to even tell me.I feel so horribly alone. I have so many people that love to come to me for help but I feel absolutely terrified to ask for help back even if they could. I cannot feel like I can open up like that, I do not want to trauma dump, especially how when I tell people my stories they get so disgusted and cannot handle it. I do not even know dude.

"I have suffered from chronic depression caked with anxiety for my whole life. it is an inherited thing, so no getting rid of it. Maybe I will not have kids, but I try to look at my life as a gift with an obstacle. When people do not know you have depression it is like they feel the need to point out everything that is wrong with you, and when you are happy you do not understand how important that is to you.it is so hard for me to find something that lifts me, but I have realized that there are things that exist for each and every person that feel like a calm bubble of air after drowning for what feels like an eternity. it is hard for other people to understand why I get so happy over things like this, even my friends who suffer with the same thing as me, but I am so happy because for a short moment I get to experience joy and I want to savor it and feel the breeze of relaxation on my nerves. The thing that cheers me up the most is music. If life were perfect everyone would be kings and queens and everyone would be allowed to dance and have fun while listening to it all. I cannot speak for everyone but I can say that this gleam of light has made me feel so much better about life. Maybe some of you guys who suffer with depression can think about something that makes you guys happy and try to make the most of it from now on.For those of you who feel like me, what things lift you up and make you happy? I appreciate everything that makes me happy",0
"This is not for me but my lady's ex, he has mentioned suicidal thoughts in the past and that his depression is causing him to leave my lady's room at her parents into an inhospitable state (he lives at her parents' house).

My lady also has depression but it has not flared, I do not want to be blacklisted in case they find nothing wrong with him and she needs me to call.What steps will they take if they determine he does have depression? I do not want it to affect his everyday life and his work because he does not really have anywhere to go.I can understand that this can be perceived as a sort of revenge or prank at him especially since he is my lady's ex, but I do have a soft spot for those with depression because I had a hard time overcoming it when it was big for me, and now that there are actually resources I would like to reach out so he can get the help that I never got.

I feel like my emotions are exaggerated, I express them too warmly (not in a good way) compared to other people. I feel like I am amazed and impressed by things others around me do not bat an eye on. I feel like so much of how I feel is extra, overly emotional, not fitting for the situation, like I am overflowing. Its really hard to describe. But its really alienating. I know I am not the first person to move abroad and feel alienated, but I just did not think it would happen in this way. I thought that was things like different cultural norms, language barrier, feeling homesick, etc. that made you feel alienated. But I am internalizing this so much. Feeling like I myself am abnormal.

I hate these humans who walk around like zombies oblivious to anything that is not them or does not concern them. People do not care about anything but their own wants and needs, even if it fucks over others. it is disgusting. I am a hypocrite for saying it I will admit, I have done bad things in my past when I was blissfully oblivious too. But consciously knowing, feeling it all... Just too much.

"Nothing makes me happy long term. Whenever things that do make me joy in the short term, they ALWAYs lead to a nose dive of depression afterwards. I have crippling anxiety that does not seem to get any better not matter what I do.I understand that that is life. That all good things mush come to end. But that is the point. There was a quote about this from a show that I will never forget, It goes: ""that is exactly it, are the best parts of life just finding momentary distractions to keep yourself busy so you do not think about the harsh reality of life for a second? I can ride roller coasters, meet new friends, and spend time with my family all day long. it is does not change the fact [that]... all of this was for nothing.""I see a life I do not want. The way the economy is going, constantly being burnt out, living paycheck to paycheck, having to put up with abusive bosses because I rely on them to survive. and quite frankly, I do not see anything changing. The people at the top will continue to make everyone is life more miserable if it means they get to continue to live in luxury. If anything, things are going to get worst.I am in the weird half-way point. I have made the decision that in two years time, if nothing improves, I am going to die. I do not want to mindlessly suffer just for the thin possibility that things might get better. Despite this, I do not know if I want to die, like, I want to, but then I will not be able to feel those little bits of joy. Conversely, it will not matter because I will be dead. it is not I will be conscious to know what I am missing.As far as I know, there is no afterlife. Many of the worlds religons say that there is a hell. I do not know. I am not relgious. So many people say so many different things that its impossible to know. I just hope that if there is a god that he is merciful and understand my mental suffering.

I loved them (in every sense) more than I have ever loved anyone else including myself. We actually ran away together but then had to come back because of our silly little obligations. Even before they passed I had days were the only reason I got out of bed and went to class was because I knew it would distract me from the things that were keeping me in bed. I would frequently lay on the floor for hours at the end of the day, so much so that I eventually just go a sleeping bag which I keep rolled out in a corner of my room. My poor mental health only spiraled after their death. Suddenly, the person I told everything to was gone. The person who forced me to apply to half of those things was gone. And so when acceptance letters were rolling in I was not happy because I could not celebrate with the one person I wanted to celebrate with. I am not saying they were my only friend, I have 3 other people that I al extremely close to, but my friend who passed was always the very first person I told.Then in late April things got really bad and I ended up getting forcibly hospitalized for a week. Suddenly all of the freedom that I spent my entire life working for was gone and I had to work my ass of to be cleared for release.Now I just feel weird all the time. Like I have done all these things but I am not happy. I feel more alone than I have ever felt before and I am scared I am going to spiral again. My therapist is also quitting so I have to find a knew one and that is stressful and I feel like I have no one left I can be sad with because realistically I think the only thing I experience anymore beside sadness is apathy. It all just feels weird",0
My brothers Patrick and Daniel I hope you rot in hell. They bullied me for appearing gay while they coerced me into sexual relationships at age 8. You guys stole from me everything of worth.

"If my mom tells me my depression is fake and I am only doing it when things do not go my way just because i do not go out with her other family, what do i do? she is told me that when we went on a two day vacation last week, i did not look or seemed depressed so I must be faking it. An hour ago we when to walk in the park and she asked me if I wanted to go to a water park with my little sisters and i say no thank you, she gave me her usual snarky reply ""well i cannot obligated you to go"" however this time I had enough and i ask her ""why do you always have to give me a reply like that"" ""why cannot you just accept my no and move on"" then she started scolding me and so i walked away so i did not burst into a argument with her like we do everyday and told her I will met her in the car while she finished her lap. When we got in the car she told me that she is done with me and she is not going to talk to me anymore just like my father does (recently moved to my mom's because I was going to attempt suicide at my dad's, however my dad does not know anything about my depression and i do not feel comfortable yet moving back/taking to him about it) as well as telling me that I must have a strong hate for everyone since i cannot co exist with anyone if things do not go my way. She told me I am an awful daughter and that no one will love me because I have so much hate inside of me. And that i do not love her or anyone in this life. And continued telling me that what my feelings are without ever asking me once what my truth feelings are. Then she kept pointing out that I am a ""cabrona"" (bitch in Spanish) and that I am going to fail in life if i do not drastically change myself. I have nothing going for me, i currently do not go to school, do not have a job, and do not have friendsAnd since that is what society values I am basically nothing and a piece of shit and a bitch as my mom says.So suicide seems like my best option since my only option of hope just told me to figure it out because she is not going to be in my life unless i do not make the effort to be a good daughter in her eyes.

"Talking to my mom today, and she says, I do not drink because when you were little I had to watch you, which I just silently agreed to, when in my head I am thinking it would have probably been better for you to just be drunk rather than what you actually did you dumb bitch because what she used to do is leave 3-4 year old me basically alone in the house because on a regular basis she would lock her bedroom door and take long naps. What kind of irresponsible and neglectful parent does that shit. And she thinks I am too stupid too remember that. Like I could have drank liquor and bleach or burned the damn house down. And yeah let us not forget the time my mom violently beat down the door in a fit of rage where my dad had to take me and we had to hide in the closet and the police had to show up. Which my dad did not press charges, which would have in the long run prevented her from getting custody over me preventing mountains of more abuse. I do not resent my father for that though. Hes just too forgiving like that. there is other things my mother did that I was too young to remember in which the only person with guts enough to tell m is my grandpa, who is one of the few reasons I have not offed myself yet. Every time I was slapped, punched, kicked, even slammed into the wall. Every time I was verbally abused, every time I was neglected. Child abuse is something that becomes imbedded into you. It forever changes you. I have some form of ptsd, one of the therapists told me. I remember one instance my mother tried to kick me. This time I had enough I grabbed her leg mid kick, immediately her expression changed, I twisted it, she said stop, almost crying. I was livid, almost overtaken with the thought of revenge. I asked her in a deep angry tone, do you want me throw your sorry ass on the floor? I realized in a moment of clarity that Id probably be locked in a jail cell if I did that. I stopped what I was doing. Felt guilt. Was I wrong? Was I right? Ill never know. Just as Ill never know who I would have been without a psychotic abusive parent. Abuse",1

"This post is pretty much me trying to put abstract thoughts into words, so this may not make much sense or be in a logical order.I cannot make any sense of my thoughts or emotions. For as long as I can remember my general mood has been following a set pattern, where for a few months my emotions would generaly be happier and the next few months sader. It would not be an extreme difference, but noticeable at night while trying to sleep. Since I started high-school (2019) every few ""cycles"" there is a period of about a month where I feel sader than a normal ""sad period"". I originally attributed this to the increased stress and left it at that. But midway though the great year that was 2020 I began having a small, very faint feeling that I just did not want to exist anymore. This was during a particularly bad ""sad period"". This would because alarm bells to ring in anyone, but I knew I would not act on these thoughts due to my life philosophy. My general approach to life is to impact other people's lives positively, and to try and limit any/all negative impact. Now here is the main problem with everything. I will not tell anyone like my parents I have had any form of suicidal thoughts, because that would because them pain, and if I did act on it, then they would feel like they failed and should have done more. It would because them guilt that they did not see anything before. I just do not want to risk them being hurt. For that same reason I cannot risk hurting them if I act. So I cannot do anything.Now I have just left my current period of sad, so I feel I have the ability to prosses my thoughts a bit more rationally. This period felt worse, and for about a week I could not draw my attention away from the feeling.But I might not be REALLY suicidal (like I said, bad order) because almost every time I imagined or dreamed myself jumping off a building there was always someone else there, trying to talk me out of it. This is what confuses me, and why I cannot tell if I am really depressed/suicidal or this is just some twisted attempt my subconscious is devising to draw peoples attention to me.I would never attempt anything currently, I do not want to hurt anyone around me. But I am just worried if the current trend continues I do not know what I might do.Because I have no idea if I am blowing nothing out of proportion I have not told anyone. I will not drag anyone else into my issues. Councilors would tell my parents due to the potential severity.So to summarize, I might be depressed yet cannot act on it, or I could be not and just attention seeking. I do not know if putting my thoughts here is also me just attention seeking. I just do not know.Can anyone relate to or prosses these thoughts better than I can?Am I mentally ok? I cannot make any sense of my thoughts or emotions",0

"Hi there! I am new here and I hope this is okay to ask. I (21f) struggle with symptoms of depression due to ADHD and anxiety, but my boyfriend (23m) mainly struggles a lot with depression. Hes been traveling for work for about three months now, he visited two weeks ago and seemed very happy to be home. He recently got switched over to another job (the company he works for basically sends him and his team to different jobs as they are needed) and he hates it. Hes working from 3am-3pm and I cannot even imagine how hard that must be. Hes been struggling a lot and I am really trying to support him and stay positive, but its really hard sometimes. He barely talks to me. The most I have gotten to talk to him in the last two weeks is for 10 minutes a day. I want to be loving and understanding, because I understand how hard this is for him, but I am at a crossroad. Mainly because while I get this is very hard for him, it is for me too. As someone with anxiety (and some trauma from past relationships) I have communicated to him that I need at least a little bit of time to check up on him and talk to him. 20 minutes is enough for me. But hes been saying that because hes been depressed, he does not ever really feel like talking. I totally get that, and I do not want to because him any stress, but by doing that I am causing myself and my mental health a lot of pain. I know we can work through this, but I would really appreciate some insight or advice on this. Anything will help. Partner with depression",0

"I have been thinking tonight and i think i had anxiety for more than i can think of. in first 2 years of uni and last year of high school i had a friend whom was anxious and he kind of gave his vibe to me, i panic a lot over small stuff. still it was worse when he was around and since i have not seen him i feel better but, maybe he induces my anxiety, other than that my mom does the same since she probably has anxiety issues but also depressed and taking depression pills. i do not know, i remember in first grade i sat down alone and just felt alone and dissatisfied, this feeling of dissatisfaction still continues till today. i had that feeling of loneliness maybe till 5th grade and then anxiety replaced it? i always feel i cannot trust people, nor they can trust me and i feel worthless. maybe its a relationship issue? i remember in kindergarten there was a girl that we liked each other but after that i moved out of that city.i feel lack of self-esteem and motivation, for last 4 years or so i have not done anything really, i guess i was more active in 7th grade(13yo) but it gradually went down till 12th where this guy came up and started his nihilistic crap and laziness and it felt like a hit on a nail and i failed 2 studies that year, me whom was acing before.was it puberty that messed me up? I am 22 now but i never had any relationship in my life, i was straight till 18, then anted to make my options more so i did not really care about gender till 20 but then again i feel i cannot get that emotional attachment to a same sex person. speaking of emotions i think i have emotional pain, sometimes my body, my chest and wrists hurt alot and i cry in my bed, i think i have this since when i was 13.i do not have much hope on stuff, things feel a bit numb, my studies are not going well and in last 2 semesters (thanks to covid) i have not seen many people and i did not study anything, but there were some friends around and we cheated the exams, which i personally have issue with. first semester i dropped a class because the guy gave points to everyone but i wanted to learn the topic so i dropped but now i just feel indifferent, i want to do stuff but i feel i cannot, i feel weak and not in control of my life, i feel i cannot stand for myself and get to anything that i ever want and if i want to do it, something will eventually go wrong and make me to lose. i feel failure is always there and its not a bad thing that happens and makes me sad, its just a part of everything i have or dream of, i guess i cannot achieve anything. i wanted to lose my weight for so long but anxiety made it just worse. i have lost much time that i cannot spend to experience and find stuff that i want i guess, or get skillfulled in two or three skills that i really want and i should just pass on. i failed my uni entrance exam in order to go to a good uni and went to a more normal one which i did not like, and i wanted to change it 3 times and the idea never left me and i still have nightmares about it, i tried to face and do it again but was just looking at an escape because it all was painful and was hurting me even more and someone told me to drop it, so i did stop taking re-entrance exam.i do not know what is wrong with me, i went to therapist 2 times but i could really speak since i just do not know.since this is too long i guess no one will even comment on this, huh i would not be amazed what is wrong with me?",0
"I grew up in a very abusive household, and my friends also hPpened to be physically and emotionally abusive narcissists.

STRESSED, I am THE ONE that is STRESSED. I WORK ALL DAY, I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT BUISNESSES I DEAL WITH. IF YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN, you will FUCKEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS"".Since i was a child he is been training me everyday since i was a kid id go to wwork with him, untill i started school. Then it was jist the summmers. And then it was weekends and summers by the time i was 12. I jad become severely overweight and only haad 2 physically and emotionally abusive friends. By the time i was 14, i was essentially running one of the buisnesses myself. Yet he acts like i have all this fucken free time to do everything he needs when I am trying to have my own life. He goes, ""you can do whatever you want"" but then also forces me to work under him, and underpays me when he finally made me become an employee since we were lacking manpower at the time. Anything I have ever said was ignored, constantly belittling. All i feel is emptiness at this point. And finally realizing that my friend was a fucking sociopathic rapist. I mean i always new he was a bad person but i never fully understood. I have a very child like, bubbly personality ehich was just ripe for abuse i guess.

For fuxks sake, I have been ditched at a piehole pizza because i had the keys and my friend had the food, i went to unlock my door, he saw and rushed at my with his fist in the air ready to punch me, i flinched and tossed the keys over his head. It fell and broke this plastic compass his father got him. His mom and dad divorced. because from what he told me, he was an alcoholic. But they still see eachother alot.

"I am going to be turning 30 in a couple weeks.I am a white dude from Washington State and I grew up playing a lot of video games (n64, etc)I never did well in school because I never spent any time studying, my mother watched 6 kids (2 cousins, 3 siblings and then myself) so she was too busy to make sure I was getting assignments turned in. My dad worked full time manual labor and he was always too tired when he got home and I never wanted to bother him on his days off.Fast forward to Sophomore high school, my dad gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma and deteriorates rapidly. He passes a little after my 16th birthday. I end up dropping out and working part time jobs.I was dating a girl who still to this day I feel like in a universe or reality that I was not shit, I would have ended up with her. I still talk to her sometimes and she is awesome, but she has her own life now.Anyway, she ended up leaving around the same time my dad passed away so between working (first job was at GameStop, and yeah it was fucking awful) I would spend most of my time in my room listening to Postal Service and crying.I tried to get back into school, ended up taking some community college classes. Dropped out, came back, dropped out etc I am not sure how many times between the ages of 18 to 21. When I was 22 I started dating again, and the first girl I slept with I ended up getting pregnant. I was always taught do not have sex because it will make Jesus cry and I kind of did not really give a fuck about that. What should have been said was it will kill your youth and leave you an empty broken person or at least, that is how it was for me.We talked and decided she should have the baby and she came to live with me at my moms house (what a catch I am right) and I supported her through her awful pregnancy (lots of morning sickness, etc)I end up getting a job at Safeway and a friend teaches me how to drive and loans me enough to buy a shitty car that lasted me about 2 years.So by this point I am 25ish and we move in with our son to a new apartment. I am actually in school and doing well this time and she is working as a bartender. I finish school by the time I am 27 and graduate with an associates in paralegal studies.Just about right after I find a new job using my degree She stops working. I bugged her about working or going to school constantly because I felt like you should always be striving to improve? Or something. Just sitting at home while I am working is kind of shit because the entire time we were together I was either working or in school.During this time in our wonderful life together, she brings home an older Korean gentleman and fucks him on our bed. We had an argument over her not doing anything and she went to the bar she used to work at and decided that is the best thing for her to do I guess.We worked through that. I had this idea of having a nice family and I made so many decisions because of this. The year before the pandemic I tell her that I am going back to school to get a bachelors because I do not earn enough for us to live with just me working. So that means we will have to move back in with my mom which She did not like. I was kind of in the tough shit mood because I was doing all the heavy lifting. Right before I started going to class my grandmother passed away and left me a bit of money. I always wanted to go to Japan and so did She (my then fianc) so we took a few week trip and it was fun.So about a year into me going to school she has a meltdown and tells me that I do not give her enough affection (which, she could have been right) but my idea of affection was providing. I always told her I did not care what she did after I graduated, but until then she should at least contribute.She ends up leaving and moving in with her friends. Then from there She ends up meeting a girl and becomes the third person in that relationship. She leaves me to take care of our son. she would rather be getting fucked by two people than even attempting to be a good mom to him. I mean she was never a great mother, but kids do not really understand that. I have long since had the mom is not coming home talk with my son but he still says stuff like when mom comes back etc and it kills me.So for about the past few months I have been living in this pure agony. She will call him every day or so, but I want absolutely nothing to do with her. I feel like if there was not a child involved it would be a clean easy breakup. I have dealt with breakups before. The idea that I am chained to this woman through him is so fucking aggravating. She texted me saying she was going to come pick him up and have him stay the night with her (she lives an hour+ away) I said the fuck you are, as long as I have known her she spends most of the day getting high and I know she is living with people who grow their own weed. So yea, fuck that. Also she cannot drive and I do not want this lady I do not know driving this kid around.I obviously care a lot for my Son, but I have realized just how meaningless everything truly is. I wish I would have made better decisions, maybe not had a child with a psychopath.I am an average looking dude who had horrible acne and still does and I have realized that when I get acne it always leaves a scar on my body. The ones on my face I do not touch, but the ones on my body will pop just from sleeping and those always leave nice bright pink scar tissue.I am down about 35 pounds since April. I was 220 and last I weighed myself out of the shower I was 185. I have not been eating or sleeping much. Before this I never did drugs but I have been spending just about every moment not with my son (my mom has been helping me and she is wonderful) getting cross faded and screaming into pillows or crying. I used to have horrible anxiety but ever since I started actively wishing I was dead I have not had panic attacks.I do not want to work again. I do not want to go back to School in the fall. I do not want to start dating again, but I would have liked real help raising him. I feel so guilty bringing a child into this shitty fucked up world. The only thing stringing me along is the thought of what my son will have to go through when I am gone. Id like my mother to take care of him and not his drug addled mother.Ultimately I feel like I wasted my entire life. I know success can be measured in different ways but what do I really have? I have no friends. I am in an insane amount of debt and my body is falling apart. I am starting to lose my hair and I cannot grow a beard due to genetics. The only thing Id be willing to accept is a reset button. I believe that when you die that is it just lights out and that sounds so much better than what I am feeling daily.I know where this is heading. I cannot afford to keep going to school now that she is gone because I exhausted everything I had because I thought someday she would give a fuck and start working but yea that never happened.Id rather be dead than work in a grocery store for minimum wage while single handedly raising my kid. I know he will miss me when I am gone, but all this shit is meaningless anyway. The Universe will have its heat death and that will be itIm sorry if anyone actually read all this. I should have made better choices. I do not want to get help, I do not want to get better. The bottom line is I need to go back in time. Anything other than that means nothing to me. I am not going to be killing it in my mid to late 30s, its fucking over for me.On my 30th birthday I am going to go to a bar with my full bottle of Trazadone, drink a shit ton and then down the pills in the bathroom. I wrote a will and I am ready to end this agony Thinking of ending it on my 30th Birthday",1
Can i pay someone to kill me? Is it suicide? Is it suicide?,1
"pretty much the title. i just cannot bring myself to care about other people anymore no matter how unkind and cold that is. but the thing is I am also very self-aware and i know i do not want to recklessly say anything harsh and insensitive to other people-- i think them but i just never say them (but mostly this is just because i am too tired to deal with the drama that will ensue if i hurt other people with my words). so what i do is just feign responses they expect from me. they only like it when you respond that way but the moment you start even mentioning your depression, it feels like they already want to leave the conversation or move on to the next topic. they suddenly do not want to listen to anything you have to say and that really fucking hurts because most of the time, that is really all i need (not that it will make my depression suddenly go away, but i think it helps me get by a little). so yeah I have learned to just keep repressing everything and feigning every response to the people around me. i feel like I have become skilled at feigning a positive mood in front of other people and feigning interest in what they have to say but the truth is i actually could not care less about whatever they say",0
"it is just to much for me to handle I cannot stand being in this useless body everyday its agonizing pain.

I just wish I could kill myself the only thing stopping me is I am scared on what death will feel like I cannot take this anymore",1
"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK. Any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated. My (M21) friend (F21) has been planning to k*ll herself next week and I do not know what to do",1
"I am in a living hell. I am 42yrs old, living in a domestic violence shelter for women, full of screaming children, and in a strange town. No job, no family, no friends, my 7 year relationship with my now ex, was all I had. I have suffered from BPD and MDD most of my life with little relief. I have been in and out of behavioral health hospitals and left them with more trauma than when I would go in. I am tired of people and professionals telling me there is help; it is so cliche and platitudinous to me. I have zero desire to ""start over again"", I do not have the mental strength to even think about getting and holding a job. I just feel done. Is it so bad to feel done? Is it so bad to BE done? I just wish there was a for sure way to kill myself that was quick and painless. I am thinking about CO2 poisoning with charcoal briquettes in my car and just going to sleep listening to my favorite music. It will not be quick though, that is what is scary to me. What if someone finds me and then possibly have brain damage for the rest of my life. I just want to die, and die with dignity.

"Relationships have never worked for me. In my adult years, I have worked hard to be self reliant and happy with myself. I go to therapy, finally got on meds, trying to eat right and exercise. Most of the time, I am great.But every time I start to think ""hm, I should let someone else in!"" I am reminded why I shut everyone out over a decade ago. My therapist says I need to let people in but it is like... there is a wall there for a reason? We did not put that up for fun? It was not fun at all, and took blood, sweat, and tears to realize that, even though I do not like myself, I sure cannot depend on anyone else.Also I feel stupid when I get hopeful. And think I can let someone in.Then either it turns out I overestimated. Or, even better, they do like me, but I require DEVOTION before I can trust them, and, of course, as any sane person would, they run. I am like that blob comic, where they get punched and go back in the box, now with thicker walls,""Never again! "" Pretty sure I am meant to be alone?",0

"i am depressed, so fucking insanely depressed. i have been a sad person all of my life, i present as extremely high functioning and even fool myself sometimes. i have immense amounts of trauma that i cannot fucking process. i have panic attacks every morning. I cannot help but feel hollow inside, completely carved out and like i do not exist. the worst part is when i start to feel like I am trapped inside myself and i start to itch to get out. its overwhelming and it takes everything to keep the feelings from coming. its so much easier to feel nothing and just keep going. does anyone know what i mean? when you feel completely hollow all the time until randomly you start to fill up and almost burst out of your skin? literally like your body is going to explode and you cannot breath? I have no one to talk to, and even if i did what would i want them to say? no amount of help will fix me. I have always been stuck here, i barely exist. i only exist to support others, I am a paycheck for my partner, a body for my job, a failure in every other regard. a pathetic college drop out who put the needs of others first and is left completely empty. i have always looked at myself from the outside, i can remember memories of me watching myself as if i was a movie. i feel dramatic and self centered and at times i want to laugh at myself for how pathetic i am but i just cannot seem to find it in me to feel anything. my body just keeps moving and i just keep watching it, I am never present. if i had control i would end it, i should have ended it years ago.

"I think the only thing that would have ever made me happy is connections. Having friends, or a loving family, strong relationships. I do not know why I am so unlovable. Like my very existence is some sort of offense. I would do anything and change everything about me if anyone would just let me in. It hurts so much. I know now that I will never have that. I tried to kill myself last week. I called everyone I knew. Only a couple people even replied. Even then, they did not really want to help. The only reason why I did not, is because I am stupid and naive, and keep telling myself someone will love me, even though all the evidence is to the contrary. Today I made a big step though. I accepted it. I accepted that I will never be anything to anyone. I will never be loved. And when I am gone, I will not be remembered. Yes, It will always hurt, and I will carry that with me for the rest of my life. But I will carry it still. it is freeing because I know who I am now. I am no one. I wish I could have been happy. I wish I could have been loved. I will settle for free. I am free because I am no one. And that little freedom is worth living for, at least for now. But its not permanent. I need to keep searching.

My doctor prescribed a low dose (20mg) cymbalta to help with some corneal neuropathic pain. It seemed it help for the few days I took it but then I read all of the issues people have coming off of it versus other antidepressants and discontinued it due to that. My nerve pain is now back and I am on the fence about taking it again since it really did help (I also have some mild anxiety and depression so it was a plus to help with those also). The general consensus online seems to be that it is an absolutely terrible drug to have to taper off of and people seem to develop chronic issues from it even after being off of it a while. My doctor simply tells me do not worry about that when I inquired about the withdrawals. Can any medical professionals give me some input? Is it really that bad for most people? I would like to not be in pain anymore but also do not want to because meow problems for myself in the long run Is tapering off of cymbalta as scary as people make it seem? It helps me but I am scared to keep taking it,0

"God I love this boy so dearly and it physically pains me to see him suffer. Lately hes been spending a lot of days in bed and has not been motivated to do the things he enjoys. When I called him today he seemed so sad and did not have much energy. He told me he did not sleep well the past couple of nights. When he told me these things, I almost immediately tied them to being possibly depressed and I have no idea what to do. I told him that I love him and understand how he might be feeling right now. I said that everything would be okay and that he can ALWAYS talk to me if he feels like hes alone and needs help. I gave him some tips (that I learnt in my therapy for anxiety and ocd) like trying to focus on doing some meditation and becoming more active. I invited him to do some yoga with me and meditation, but he did not seem keen (which is okay). I am just so scared to lose him to this horrible illness and I just want to help him but I do not know how to.. can someone please help ? How do I help my boyfriend ?",0
"Hello,I am a 27 year old male, who recently had to end a 3 year relationship because things were not getting better. I put so much into it and thought we would marry. I noticed she would always watch asian stuff , really like asian boy bands, really liked asian boys and was not afraid to show it. I thought maybe its a fan girl thing but no. I saw her watching videos of girls that had asian boyfriends a lot and it was all asian boyfriend porn to put it into something understandable. She has out bursts a lot. She says things happened that really did not and it really scares me. I love her so much, but we can go on like this. I am not perfect either, I am a drug user, benzos are my weakness because I act terrible on them, I cut myself when I take them in large doses. its hard for me to control my dose because I use liquid, not pills, atm. I am going to court for a DUI theft and a VOP with 6 and a half years back up.... I am scared. I paid a lawyer 6000 for all the cases. I can play the piano real well people always tell me I am smart. I do not think I am very smart but people say it. I am sitting here, there is blood everywhere now.I cried and cut myself when I got home from the store and was a huge dick to my mom. we have a strange relationship. she has put me through a lot of hell by always trying to get me busted by the cops for drugs.

"Hey everyone. I am a 21yrs old guy studying in college and in the last 4/5 years I am feeling depressed with my life when I think about my social life. I was always an introvert guy and have some social anxiety. I have never had a lot of friends and a girlfriend. However since my last year in the high school I started to get some depressive thoughts, due to the majority of my friends started to have a bf or a gf and planed a lot of group activities while me and my best friend were barely part of these activities. When I started college I tried to find a new group of friends but that did not work and these depressive toughts started again. A lot of times I feel like I do not know what to do and feel bad with myself, wondering if I am not meant to have friends (I mean I only have like 3 or 4 friends I can trust) and a girlfriend that really cares about me.

"I generally would not do this but I am at my breaking point, it would take me forever to gather a list of shit I have been through, from being sexually assaulted by my father when I was 4-6 to foster care, home after home until I was 11 and finding my mom dead at 15 and so so much more I do not think I can take this life anymore there is nothing good out there for me. Not to mention I have BPD and C-ptsd which make my life a living hell on a daily basis. I also recently had an incident where I found out my only friend since 6th grade was saying things like he hopes I kill myself and I am fucked up garbage from being abused and I should have been aborted all because I needed to take a step back from him because he was not treating me well. I have no one not one person would even know I was dead and every time I picture my funeral no one is there because I genuinely am all alone, anytime I try to make friends people cannot handle my emotions or they think I am weird I get left on read or ignored by the few people I do know.

"I have typically always been one who can dish and take jokes and things with my friends. Recently, I have felt as if I am taking things in a personal manner. Not the context of the joke or comment but the repetition. It has allowed me to almost feel guilt for things that are not true or legitimate. I do not know how to tell my friends that its negatively affecting my mental health, because I do not want to seem like a victim and have them assume I am too sensitive to jokes or comments that are not necessarily harsh, but at the same time, its exhausting me mentally and physically in ways that I cannot explain. I hope this post makes sense to someone. Has anybody experienced anything similar, if so, how have things went since in your relationships? Not sure how to face the feelings I am dealing",0

"So I considered myself a master in the art of being alone. I have been truly alone for 3 years. I actually got so used to being alone I had no problems with it. I was proud of myself and my brain. I could mention hundreds of the benefits of being alone and I overall just did what I want.However, recently I was playing a video game and someone messaged me to talk about something that happened in the game we played. We ended up playing with each other and talking, overall having fun. Biggest mistake I ever made. The person not have any interest in talking with me anymore or being a friend after a month and a half. Which truly depresses me alot and I wish it did not. And I now crave not being alone, even though I should be for many reasons, like my mental well being. Dammit. Have to go thru mastering it all over again. I made the mistake of talking to someone and getting close to them after mastering being alone",1
"Title is basically this, we were together for almost 7 years which is almost a third of my life. She was my first and only love and I do not want to find anyone else becaue I only ever loved her.

"So I (17y F) am so tired of my alchoolic father that one day I even taught about running away or commiting suicide, I do not feel safe around him. I feel terrified of him. Basically EVERY DAY, when he comes back to work he goes at his ""friends"" who he has a drink with then he comes back home enraged and he will scream at every member of my family for no fucking reason. He never hit me or some shit like that, but you know the saying ""Words cut deeper than a knife"". I am thinking about moving out with my boyfriend next year when I will be 18, that would be a dream, but then I would lose all my family including my mother who is the only one supporting me in all of this this, she does not agree with moving out so early. How can I just get rid of all of this? My abusive father",0

"Feeling so incredibly overwhelmed this past week. The past 8-9 months I have been so fucking depressed. It began with moving to a new city hoping it would be a 'new start' and a change of pace. But ever since I have moved, I have felt isolated like I have never felt before. I do not understand the people in this new city. The job that got me to move has been unbearably frustrating and has some what put a hold on me life. How? I do not even know. I do not have friends or family here. I have never been so isolated in a crowd of people. I do not even enjoy been up during the day. And the worst issue is, I do not know how to talk to my family about things that are stressing me out. The rage, frustration and loneliness is all bottled up inside and I do not know how to deal with it. The one thing I could always rely on to help with my depression is the main thing causing my depression. Honestly do not know how to deal with it anymore. If anyone has suggests, that would be greatly appreciated. cannot seem to catch a break.",0

"I grew up moving a lot and for that reason I do not have many long time friends. Childhood friends? None. I do not think I even know how to make friends anymore because every person I meet at work or college I think are just colleagues and do not even like me outside of that environment.Since my fiance proposed, I have been facing the fact that our wedding is going to have a bunch of people he knows and like, my family? One or two friends of mine? That thought makes me insanely sad, and I do not want him to feel bad about having more friends than I do, but I know I am lashing out on him.Everytime we go out with his friends, he says I am rude to him and to other people. He says I either try to take all his attention to myself or I just stay there, watching people and saying nothing - which he thinks it is rude.That has happened a lot of times in the last three years and I have been thinking about how I do not have more than two real friends and maybe that is why I do not know how to communicate or behave. I do not know if I suffer from social phobia, if it is just my depression and anxiety or if I am actually rude. I think I may be crazy. Like, actually crazy.Its been so hard that everytime I need to leave the house to meet his family or friends, I feel like throwing up, I get so nervous I keep imagining how everything is going to go and how I should behave. Should I say hi and hug people? Should I just stay quiet? Maybe I should just stay on my phone, or try to talk to people? If they ask me something, how should I respond? Should I smile, should I even continue the conversation or just answer the question?I do not know how I am going to live like this. I feel like I do not ever want to go out again. My fiance says I am rude and treat him and other people bad. I do not know if it is just my depression or something else",0
"I am not sure why I did it tonight. I just felt like I wanted to. I did 4 cuts total but only 3 of them bled. It was not even dripping just drops. Same tiny razor blade, slapped a smaller bandage on. It does not sting as much as last night, just feel it throbbing. I had a pretty ok day today, just longing for my ex. I am hurting but not physically, even if the pain in my heart slowly becomes physical I made a new friend, he asked to hang out tomorrow.

"I need help, but do not with what. I have not had that innate want to live for quite a while, and just living right now takes all of me. I am nauseous from anger and resentment most of the time, and nothing drives me. I have never made plans for 'that', but today I just feel so, empty. Like the hollow husk that held what was left of me fell off. I cannot grasp onto a single want that I have to be here. Everything I have is someone else's wish for me. I am supposed to go to college soon, but it honestly sounds like another four years of somehow drowning further. I do not want that. I just want to be happy, but Everytime I am I feel guilty, like I am doing a disservice to those who cannot smile. I go between hating the world and hating myself, and because of that I cannot cope anymore. It feels like there is this big barrier between me and everyone around me. Like you tell 100 people to talk to me today, and I would still feel alone. I am sorry for anyone who has to read this, I just wanted to tell someone, because I feel that talking to anyone else would just be a burden on them. I hope you all have great days, and thank you for the ear. I do not know what to do.",1
"No matter how much I try, I can never see on why someone would willingly talk to me with their time and actually treat me like a human. I have such a negative mindset onto myself that I cannot fathom why people would talk to the likes of me.Do they talk to me out of pity? Want something from me in the future as 'compensation'? Do they really not have anyone else better to talk to? Other than these 3 questions that I always get into my head, I cannot help but wonder why else they would talk to me without hating me as a person.I cannot help but wonder if I just tried a little harder, maybe I would not be suicidal either and probably would not have to think of these negative thoughts over and over again. Why do I feel like everyone secretly hates me?",1

I sit here hating every part of me. Wishing when I attempted this shit 12 years ago I would have succeeded. Here I am 12 years have past and all my thoughts during some of my worst times have resurfaced. I am not worth being here especially because I hurt my best friend and the only person who cared for me. I cannot do a damn thing to change it or even make it better. I have been through enough breakups but none like this. I cannot stand the thought of how much I hurt this person. I already hated myself way before this but she has slowly tried to work through those insecurities. They were never fully gone thought. If I lose her then it will also be the first time I would go living without the kids but she right to say they should not be split up. All this is the worst timing because we are suppose to move to the next town over in a month. But if she leaves she will stay here so the kids do not have to transfer. But I am getting off topic. The thought of not being able to have her in my life and not have that one person to turn to sucks. This girl would have been better off if I died 12 years ago so she would have never had the chance to meet me. She gave me the best 8 years of my life and I would rather die with these memories instead of going right back down that dark path I know I am heading for. I wish I could just pull the trigger! I am such a fuck up. I just want to be done with it all.,1
"Since last summer I am in a spiral of losing myself. I am currently ""working"" on my master thesis in architecture together with my girlfriend, who also lives with me. Since the beginning I started to have this episodes where I am completely overwhelmed and then I unable to do anything anymore, believe in anything or feel anything. First I hoped that this will just go away if we push through but it became worse and worse. I reached out for help, I am seeing a therapist, visited my doctor who gave me citalopram and I am taking 10mg since 4 days. So I am working on getting better but I started to ask myself: Am I really depressed or am I just procrastinating at an absurd level? I mean I am weeping daily because of our thesis and I just do not see me working on or even finishing it. I have better days but as soon as it gets harder I just crumble. Am I just so lazy that I put myself in this misery so I do not have to work? I will also talk to my therapist but she is in holidays now.. And it would help me to hear if anyone of you had this feeling of: Am I just faking it? Am I faking my depression?",0
"I have been suicidal on and off (mostly on) since I was 14. Sometimes it is better, sometimes it is worse. The past few weeks have been awful.I have just graduated. There are loads of jobs in my field, so I could get one easy (I hope), but I just cannot face job hunting. I cannot bear the prospect of being rejected. My industry also has an incredibly high suicide rate, and I am terrified I will burn out and it will make me worse. I am back living with my parents until I get a job and a place, and that is not helping either because all my friends now live a couple hours away.I spent the past few months self sabotaging my degree. I half arsed my finals revision, I left organising my compulsory placement to the very last second. I think part of me was hoping I would fail and I would finally have an excuse to end it. I passed with honours, so I should be so proud, but I just feel numb the whole time.I do not eat, I cannot sleep. I just want to die, but I cannot bear the thought of how much it would hurt my friends and family. I spend my time playing computer games instead of doing anything productive. Speaking to my friends is exhausting.I am speaking to a counsellor, which has helped some but not completely. I had a massive breakdown 9 months ago after an abusive relationship, which is when I started counselling. Its helped with the issues I had regarding that relationship, but not so much my general feelings of hopelessness.I just want to sleep forever. I am so tired the whole time. I do not know how to fix my head. I have spent so many years feeling this way that I do not know how to begin fixing myself. I cannot go on like this, but I do not know how to get out of it. Obviously I am very suicidal, but I do not think I would ever actually do anything.Please. I need advice. I do not know how to begin to get my life together. I am so tired and I do not know what to do. I really need some help and I do not know where to find it",1

I did not have a bad life. Functiong and loving family great social circle. But i always have the feeling that i am not happy and I have never been. Somedays you can take it but it is just so hard trying to pretend to be alright when in reality you are as close to suicide as the 2 times you actually tried it. The only thing that makes me get away from my thoughts are drugs(both benzos i get from my doctor and booze and weed). it is not a solution and i know that i have a problem but i have tried everything and i have not found amything that made me feel even slightly better. Everyday i think I am at my limit. I do not know how lomg i can keep this up Just my story",0
Does anyone understand the feeling of trying really hard to feel human. Feeling the need to justify all your actions to yourself in your head even the slightest movement needs a reason that I need to know even when no one is around. Not feeling like a whole person like a girl like a teenager like a thing with emotions and interests. Always trying to be normal whatever that means. I really forgot what that means. Trying to prove that I am really here doing all the things I do but its hard when I cannot feel the weight of my actions. I do not feel like I am watching myself from far away I know I do everything I do but it feels out of my control. If I had to explain it its like i have a body bigger than my own that takes the blows rather than the me inside. A coping mechanism maybe? Distant feeling,0
I am losing it and its due to me being completely lost. I am 18 and moved out of my parents house at 15. Due to my dad and I having physical fights and my mom never being home to see or help. Been on my own since then and gotten everything by myself except for my vehicle. My dad still has it in his name since I cannot afford to put it into mine. I got pulled over the other day for expired tags (I got a pretty big ticket). My dad got angry at me telling me that I am going down i long and trashy road. I no longer have a job and I am being evicted from my apartment and I have not even finished school yet and now I am out a Vehicle because I got a ticket. I am at a dead end and I have no clue what to do from here. I have nothing now. I have been depressed since the age of 15 and the feeling of starting with nothing and getting no help into the adult world is really making me think about not wanting to be here no more. Lost.,1

"I am diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, and things were really looking up after being diagnosed a year and a half ago. Recently I have become aware of just how deeply it affects my life on a day-to-day basis, and I guess I am struggling accepting that part of myself. It does not help that I have had this premonition (I get premonitions a lot, and I know how it sounds, but they are actually very spot on) of the year 23 since 2016. I always felt it as an end, an end to what I could see anyhow, so I was not sure what it really meant. I turned 23 in August last year and it is been a pretty tense year, I have been scared of big trucks (bc that is how I am going to go) but I knew I would /know/ when the time came... well... yesterday it did... a week from now, I just feel it. And all the things that have stopped me before when I have been suicidal are either solved or do not bother me anymore. So I am just trying to figure out what to do in the meantime? I have considered going to the ER and ask for help, but I do not know what to tell them.. that I know I am going to die in a week? it sounds stupid...But I really feel no need to live any longer, I am happy with the life I have lived, and I feel like it is just the end of the road for me.do not know if anyone here can relate at all, or have any advice, but I really just wanted to tell someone. I do not really want to die, but have foretold my own death for years and it is one week off",1

Or at least, that I could find happiness in all this vast ocean of shit. Now I simply lost hope.As title says, it was the whole world what has put my in here. Its like if I have been given life just to see a grey and inert pile of shit. The world broke my heart",0
"Everyday I keep reminding myself that this feeling will not last. Everyday I make sure that I am kind to others because every human being just deserves it. Everyday I hide the fact that I feel hopeless no matter how hard I try it is just not enough. Everyday I try my best to point out to myself reasons to be happy or things to be grateful for. Every time I fail I let myself sulk for a bit and try to move on.Well I am sick and tired of it and I know I will keep trying over and over until one day the depression no longer feels crippling and overwhelming. I refuse to give in and I would be so disappointed in myself for giving up. But some days I am just so worn out, like I have no more to give. I wish I could give up on life sometimes, then I would not have to try do hard every single day. So sick of trying",0

I am very self destructive. I tend to ruin the things I find comfort in by overthinking and just putting myself down as if I am telling myself I do not deserve it. I do not deserve having things that make me happy. I do not know how to stop myself from doing this and naturally it messes me up causing my depression and self hatred to just spike. Its ironic seeing as my whole goal for this year was to gradually learn how to love myself. I am just incredibly tired of myself. I am very self destructive,0
"I am a 15 year old male, i recently came home drunk and my mom caught me.I have been depressed for like half a year now but I have never managed to tell my parents, i do not know why but its just hard to talk about i guess.when i got home, my mom asked if i was drunk. I denied it. She then asked to smell my breath and she knew instantly. She had alcoholic parents growing up so she is good at knowing when somebody is drunk. She also went through my bag and found snus, which is a kind of tobacco product.So i started crying and told her i needed help and that i was depressed. She said that she could help with that and get me a therapist. I was actually kind of relived that she caught me so i could finally get help. I was grounded for a few days and then went to my dads house the next week. And I have been back at moms house two times now for a week at a time. I think its been 3 weeks scince this.But my problem is that my mom has not said a thing about me being depressed and all that after that night. So I am not getting any help. Its not that she is a bad person and that she does not care. She is herself suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome so she is having a hard time.I think she might think it was an excuse for getting drunk. But now its back like it was before i cannot het myself to bring it up again.What should i do? What should i do?",0

"Since the pandemic began, I(m17) moved to another city(temporarily), then another one(again, temporarily), and traveled between these two towns back and forth for almost a year. In this time period, I have rarely been in the city A(with all my friends, classmates, etc.), and, pretty much was on my own for a year. At first I thought I dealt with this isolation just fine. I am introverted after all and I just relaxed and enjoyed the peace. But after a year since the pandemic has began, the solitude began to take its toll. I have felt lonely. Which eventually led me to being depressed. In the beginning of summer I was finally able to come to the city A, and meet my two closest(and perhaps only) friends. I have been here for nine days, then went to another city for two weeks and came back here for another two weeks.The social interactions with my peers, which I have craved so much and have finally gotten, made me happy, but not for long. At some points, they did not even distract me and I was as miserable around my friends as if I was by myself.I realized sometime before, that nothing makes me truly happy. I have been extremely pessimistic about my future and everything really. Soon Ill go to college and the boring, sad and dull adult life might begin.Anyway, for quite some time I have been venting about all of this to my closest friend. Today may have been the last time I saw her before our five/ten-year class reunions. we have decided to hang out(+my 2nd closest friend), but it turnt out not that great.Not only did I saw more proof that she does not really care about me(smth I realized not so long ago), but also she was cold. Most importantly, during our final goodbyes, she told me it was hard to be friends with me because of the negativity and pessimism I bring. Yeah, I was already sad, but that just made it worse. I am a burden and I knew that but I did not expect her to say smth like that. Totally understand and don blame her at all. My closest friend told me that it is really hard being my friend because of all the negativity that i radiate. That might have been the last time I saw her.",1

"My husband told me a few months ago that he is depressed. I have noticed his overall mood, treatment towards me (not abusive just can be very short and does not really want to talk or do anything with me), and treatment of himself had been going down (not working out not showering not eating well etc) but did not think it was really bad. After a few months of me being supportive and trying to help in any way I can think of he finally said he needs to see a doctor. I was excited about that; he made no effort to make an appointment and has no general doctor. So I found him one and made him the appointment which he went to with no upset and actually for a few days he seemed happy about going and being put on some meds. Hes never been a good eater and ever since the depression hit he is been worse. I have noticed he is probably lost 20 lbs at least (he was super thin to begin with). He used to be super active as well and now he will not even go on a walk.Last night at around 3am I woke up to an incredibly large thud outside our bedroom door. (He works late or stays up late every night and I normally go to bed at a normal hour). I rushed out of the bedroom to him crumbled on the floor passed out. He actually damaged the wall some with going down and now has a gash in his shoulder. He came to pretty fast but was overall super pale shaking nauseous etc. He would not let me take him to the hospital or is not letting me call his doctor today. I am not sure what caused this but I started tallying his calorie intake and he is getting around 1000 calories a day at most and when he does eat it is normally complete shit (soda chips and cookies fast food etc). he is over 6 foot and in his mid 30s. He now has high blood pressure and high cholesterol along with other health issues. I am now super worried and he still has not eaten since he passed out. I just would like some help on what to do now as now I am almost worrying of I am dealing with some sort of male anorexia and not just depression. I wrote him something last night telling him that not even eating a child's portion of food everyday nor taking regular showers is unacceptable. I do not know if something like this is ok for someone with depression or whatever is going on though. Just asking for tips to help my husband",0

Every single psychiatrist a ever had gave me same advice: do not think about that. Oh thanks, but that is literally not helping at all, if I could I would stop years ago..I just do not get it. Like, one day, you r in your twentys, living good, decent life, and other day you r 78 y old, just waiting for death. One day you are gone, and Noone will ever remember you lived. Maybe your kids, your kids kids, and that is probably it. In hundred years word will be same as you never even existed.And there will be not another cup of coffee, not another hug, not another ""good morning"" from a stranger.. You will never see another sunset, child playing, you will not feel cold water in summer, wind in face, smell of fresh book... If any of you have any advice for me, that can actualy help, a would love that. Thanks. I love life maybe too much..",0
"I do not want to extend too much, but I do not really know what to do with those type of advices.My psychiatrist and therapist, aswell as my ""friends"" told me the same thing: ""try new or more things"".Yup, I would like to, but it is impossible for me to do something new and enjoy it for more than a few minutes. I can no longer find fun in my hobbies aswell, everything feels bad and not fun or enjoyable.This is my 6th year dealing with depression but it is just getting worse and worse, cannot afford any more therapy sessions. Last week was my 2nd suicide attempt but everything went wrong, now I am here stuck in this shitty life. ""Try new things""",1
"Everyone that exists has a 'chaos' level. Basically, to sum it up, it is the amount of chaos you are prone to in your life as a whole. The universe or something decides this when you are born and you have to learn to live with it. Neurotypicals, rich people, pretty people, etc, do they have struggles? Yes. Absolutely. But their struggles are completely separate from the type of chaos I am talking about. I am talking about the type of chaos exemplified by people like me- bad childhood, mental illness, bad genes, etc etc etc. Ultimately, I have learned to cope with it all as much as I possibly can. But I think for people like me, 'coping' will never be enough. There will never be a full month of my life where I am not severely suicidal for at least a week of it. I will never have true stability like other people do because there are just so many areas of my life that are in shambles. I cannot possibly change because of how *fundamental* these issues are when it comes to actually being able to be happy on a daily basis. And then people say I can change, completely ignoring the word 'fundamental'. it is all bullshit. Some people get lucky and then those same people try to convince us that we could be like them if only we just 'kept at it'-Well let me tell you something, those people: I am the most optimistic person I know. Even after I finish writing this, I will probably smoke a bowl and watch netflix and then pass out. Rest assured, the suffering begins anew tomorrow, but there is always and always has been a shred of optimism at my core preventing me from leaving this shitty world. Yet it is not enough to stop constant mood swings and the listless other problems I seem to face on a daily basis. I could 'look at it' another way, but then how long until my meds stop working again, or another psychiatrist leaves? I cannot do this. I will, but I cannot. Maybe some of you will find that hopeful. Personally, it is just another slap in the face. Being so terribly aware of how unfair life is and yet not being able to escape.I hope all of you browsing this subreddit find out you are actually one of the people with a manageable amount of natural chaos. But my eternal curse is constantly managing to convince myself that I am. I think I finally figured it out",1
"everyday feels like a meaningless void and I am just in it. nothing has real meaning anymore, i no longer want to keep on going. my emotions are getting too unbearable for me to handle on my own. i just feel worthless. and I have tried stuff like working out, or taking walks, or something like that, but nothing is distracting me. i do not even want to leave my room anymore. i just want to die. all of this would not have happened if i just killed myself",1

"Recently I have been seeing a lot of videos of couples being happy together and being by each others side, and I am tired of being by myself, the only problem is that whenever i think about wanting a relationship, whether with a man or a women, my brain automatically says ""you do not need a relationship, they will only get in your way, what if they hurt you? What if they cheat? What if they falsely accuse you of rape?"" And I am starting to get sick of it. I cannot stand being alone",0
every thing that is supposed to matter to me feels so insignificant when I am constantly haunted by the fact that the people that i once found solace in and the people that i care about the most are not part of my life anymore and will not be for as long as i live. all because of me i cannot explain how much i despise myself. weirdly enough the lurking possibility of ceasing to exist is somewhat comforting. how can one possibly be expected to be ok. they are just thoughts they are not supposed to hurt,1
"I was accidentally born from an affair my dad had with my mom after she told him she could not get pregnant, and I lived with my mother for the first 5 years of my life. She switched around husbands/boyfriends on and off constantly, never keeping a guy, and at the same time, constantly moved around houses with me in her care. Around 5, I chose to move in with my father and I have been living with him ever since. When i first moved in, my stepmother completely denied me, refused to accept me as her child, and was only nice to me when other people were around us. As a child, I had undiagnosed ADHD which resulted in horrible mood swings and sensitivity. My family would joke about me and hurt my feelings then say I was being over dramatic and that I should feel hurt over a joke. I remember talking about it to my teachers at school but my school only taking it as a sign that i was a trouble child and that i often misbehaved. Throughout middle school, I became depressed after realizing my birth mother had basically lied to me my whole life while having to deal with my father yelling at me everyday because my room was messy. and realizing I was part of the LGBTQ+. I quote look at your room, just think. nobody will love you once they find out how you truly are. I remember so well because it was only some years ago. I told my father several times I wanted to kill myself or that I have tried, but everytime, he brushed me off and told me he could not do anything about that. Recently, I went to the mental hospital and got admitted for a week where I got diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD/ADD, and an ED. After I got out, it was better but ever since I ran out of meds, everything had been going downhill. I am struggling to do anything and its getting to the point i forget to to even eat or drink water. It was my sisters birthday on the 11th and my father broke into my room after I refused to shower for the fifth time and started yelling at me while my gf was on the phone (he did not know). I tried to defend myself and then he started threatening to take everything that makes me happy away from me. I told him how i would end up actually trying to commit again and he started telling me that i was just saying an excuse. When I tried telling him what he was doing wrong as a parent (I tried telling myself he was a good dad for so long), he told me he never did any of that and that I was just imagining things or he just did not remember. When he asked me why I never care to get out of my room, I told him it was because this family does not care for me or even check up on me. He went silent for a while and did not even respond to what i said. He tried acting like he loved me so I would stop being angry, god he does it every time. When it was all over, my gf told me they could tell why i argue the way that i do and that hearing me yell at my dad was heartbreaking because i sounded like someone who kept their feelings in fr so long and was finally letting someone feel their pain. I hate being around my father even more ever since that day and I have been slowly going back to being constantly suicidal. I hate being in this household, and I understand that I have a year and a half left till I am 18, but i do not think i will be able to get away from this shitty family. I am tired of indirectly being told that everything is my fault and that i do not have the right to feel something because its not logical. What is so hard to understand? I have been telling everyone the same thing for years and everyone continues to gaslight me and tell me my memories/feelings are not real.",1
"Right now I am sick of it. I am really trying to be nice but not for recognition but because everyone has their struggles and I would like to make people smile or at least have a breathbecause life is shit and everybody needs happy moments in their life.But even though this is not for fame or so it is not that I am not struggling too. I have social anxiety and I try to overcome it but people ignore me when I chat them/need them. I need some thankfulness.I am tempted to become an ass so hard right now. To overthrow every virtue I know. Because a ""Thank you, here is some compensation(?)."" is not asked too much for.But when I become an ass I act on my suicidal depression and everybody tells me that depression is not an excuse to be an ass. BUT IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE! NOBODY IS HERE HELP ME. Everybody walks over me",1

"I have been lying to almost everyone around me. I am not okay. I do not like my therapist and I am worried if I talk about how I really feel I will get committed to an inpatient facility. I keep going back and forth on having days that are good and then really bad and the stupidest things set me into a spiral. I feel anxious all the time and I do not love much of myself anymore. I have no energy to exercise to try and feel better about my body and I just want to kind of, stop. Like I do not want to die I just do not really want to go through the day to day anymore. My feelings do not even make sense to me because I have a wonderful partner, an amazing job, a great place to live, and wonderful fur babies that love me.

she is absolutely horrible. She seems to blame our fucked up relationship ALLL on me! Like NONE of its apparently her fault. She has this thing where she is ALWAYS a victim. And she literally thinks she is perfect. Like if you ask her what flaws she has its something like I am to nice and let people use me. My dad is abusive and I am very similar to him facial wise and a little bit personality wise too ( I am NOT abusive!) my other siblings take after my mom so she likes them more. I am basically a replacement for my father and all the problems she has with him have been placed on me. She calls me abusive at the drop of a hat and constantly calls me names. Yet somehow I am the fucked up one. Like right now we just got in a fight and she is still arguing with me even though I gave up and I am listening to music now.Our relationship is over even if in the far off future she apologized or something (which would not happen unless hell freezed over ) she is done to much damage. Sometimes just being around her disgusts me. Anyway.. I am so sick of my mom,0
"I often fantasize about suicide on days where my inner rage and low self esteem surface and I am unable to stuff it out of my consciousness. I doubt my relationships, feel broken and worthless and I cannot pin my inner rage to anything in particular.

I am in a long term relationship with a woman and am unsure if I truly love her or if I am settling because I hate being alone and feel I cannot do any better. I do not know what to do or how to improve my psyche. I am seeing a therapist and taking medication but it does not seem to have much effect.

"What else to add? I did not chose to become pregnant and a single mother. (There is more story to this but I do not want to write too much right now, as it is really traumatic for me)My parents basically pressured me into keeping the child. But tbh I do not know if I would have been able to get a abortion (mentally) if they were not involved.I love my little one. I really do. Now it is too late anyway. I will do my best to care for my baby, but I am suffering. I would honestly kill myself if I were not pregnant/a parent to a child who needs me. How can I manage the pain for at least 18 years from now on? I am only 20 y/o and have no friends. I just have my close family (stepfather, mother, younger brother) and it is currently very stressful at home. They fight a lot and I feel like a burden to them, but I have no alternative, nowhere else to go.They told me that I and their future grandchild can stay with them and they will support me. I would leave and make it easier for them, but I obviously cannot make this decision bc of my LO.I have no other option than staying with them. I am financially unstable and basically a failed human being, not able to care for myself (and my child). I am in a very bad mental state right now and I do not know how to manage anymore (professional help/hospital is no option. I do not have that much money and cannot expect my parents to pay. I already was diagnosed in the past but my parents basically ""undiagnosed"" me, as they know better than all of the mental health professionals I have seen in the past). I feel so bad for even having this kind of thoughts, but I kind of wish I will die due to birth complications. Nobody would consider blaming me.I am such an asshole for even thinking that, I know.I am so sorry my little one. Mummy is trying very hard to stay safe for you. do not worry guys. I would never do intentional harm to myself as long as baby is inside of me. I love him so much and he is the only reason I am still alive. I sadly cannot talk to anyone about this.

"My life was supposed to change for the better in two month but today I found out, that I will not be able to afford anything where I live because the money I have for a month, is enough to pay rent, school and if I am very lucky, 20 bucks worth of food for each week. I was supposed to get the money, my mum gets as child support because I move out and literally do not need to come home and use anything there. it is over 200 bucks, that would have helped a lot.

"Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining. I have had to force myself to write (which is the only hobby I can peruse because my other ones are social hobbies) to which I just think 'what is the point?"". I cannot look at my body without feeling sick of the sight. it is hard to get out of bed but when I do, I just sit there and wait. there is nothing to do. Nothing to wait for. Getting in showers or baths has become so difficult that I have resorted to making a timetable of when I need to shower. I cannot be bothered pretending anymore. I am not okay.I cannot reach out for help. My parents will think I am faking it. My friends could not care in the slightest. I do not go back to school until August (which I am dreading). I do not have anyone to turn to. In all honesty, I could not name one person that I would be able to go to for help. I do not want to die but I do not see the point in living. This is a rant more than anything. This is not a sob story. I am sure quite a few people have gone through this same experience. I can just feel myself go downhill with every passing day.

"My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep.

Like when he sleeps for 20hrs a few days in a row or when he shuts down emotionally. I always let him know that I am here when he is ready but seeing him like that is starting to hurt me. Which makes me want to be more helpful, yet I gather from what I have read and heard from others that is not actually very helpful. We have very open communication and do talk about this, but sometimes he does not know how to answer, which is understandable. I have read books and done heaps of research online about depression and being with someone with depression but I think that hearing others stories and advise would be really helpful.What are things that I can do that support him when he is at his lowest and when he is doing well? I understand that everyone is different but any suggestions or personal experiences would be helpful. Also, any suggestions for my perception of his journey- I do not have depression so I think that sometimes I take his actions and words the wrong way. Id like to be there for him and be sure to take care of my own mental health Advise for being with someone that has depression",0
"Not much to say here. I am tired of returning to this mindset in spite of everything that happens. Maybe it was just a state of mind for a while, but it feels permanent, something I cannot ever free myself from because it is just me now.I have no way of knowing if antidepressants would help. I think I am just afraid of being told it is just my state of mind and being denied the option to try. I think it might be the worry that antidepressants will not even work. Or that the people I love would feel like they were not enough if I had to rely on antidepressants.Either way, probably just going to have a cookout in my car or something, early in the morning when nobody can see. There were always easier ways but there is always a hassle and this seems the most casual of all of them. Thinking about doing it tonight",1
Her wedding is next month and is planning on inviting over 100 people including cousins she never met. When the invitations came my parents were invited but not me. They called her up and asked why I was not invited. She went silent and finally after badgering her for an answer she said I was an autistic loser and her wedding was for cool people only. Then she called me the R word and said she did not want people like me ruining the happiest day of her life. I do not know what I ever did to her. I know I am socially awkward and cannot hold conversations very well. that is no reason to exclude someone. I am so upset. She stopped talking to me years ago when she got popular in school. My family thought she would grow out of it when she got older but it never happened My (33/M) sister (30/F) invited everyone to her wedding except me,0
From where I am from you could get jailed for suicide attempts so i never had called the number. My friend did however many years ago when she suspected she was pregnant. I am scared if I call the number the police would arrive to my house and arrest me. I do not know where i could get propper help. I was hoping to wait till I am 18 to work and get propper help but I am not sure if i can wait till then. Questions about the suicide hotline.,1
I hate seeing my mom so stressed because I know she is scared Ill do something. Same goes fr my dad but he is less subtle and straight up says get that thought out of your headIm so loved and supported why cannot I just get up and fucking do something worthwhile.

"I have been suicidal since I was 17. I was miserable. Always drinking, self harming, never being honest with my family or friends and always unhappy. They all found out eventually because I had to stay at a psych ward for 2 weeks in 2017. Fast forward to present day, I meet the most incredible human being ever. We worked together, and became friends. He understood me, asked questions about my feelings, stayed on the phone with me for hours late at night, until 5 or 6am some nights. When I was talking or hanging out with him, I had no worries and I was the happiest I have been since going to Disneyland when I was a kid.Only problem is, I started to fall in love. He is taken, so I kept it to myself. I tried to get over it and just be friends. Sometimes it would be worth it and other times it would hurt but I stuck through the pain because he is too important to lose. I do not talk to my family or any other friends like that. I have tried. Hes the only one I got besides my therapist. It got to be too much one night and I ended up confessing my feelings. He said we could still be friends. That was a week ago, and he will not reply to any of my texts or calls. I am torn between giving him space and trying to fix this but it seems like he just needs time. I have been doing everything I can to distract myself. I feel empty. I cannot do this without him. A part of me is missing. I have barely spoke since this happened. I drink all the time, smoking non stop. Anything to make me forget that I might have just fucked up the best thing for me. I cannot stop thinking about all the memories we were going to share. I feel destroyed. I miss him so much. do not tell me Ill find another friend one day because this friendship is different, its once in a lifetime. my best friend is not talking to me and I just want to rot away.",1
Does anyone do this? I cannot stop. I keep looking around my friends house trying to work out the most optimal place to kms,1
"Like if something reminds her of a mistake I, or someone else, made years ago. she will bring it up and be like ""remember the time you or so and so was an asshole and did this"" and its like ""no...but I guess I do now?"" Ever since my friend has started to experience depressive episodes, she is developed a habit of bringing up others past mistakes from years ago. Is this common?",0
"I have finally been feeling physically and mentally well and planning for the future and I just broke my foot. I am so angry at my foot. Now I am back to sitting on the couch and dependent for everything since I have to keep weight off of it. I am lucky to have someone to help me but it is such a setback that I feel sad and discouraged. I really do not want it to lead into a depression and just hoping my meds keep it from going there. I am a BTS ARMY so I am trying to just pay attention to good stuff from them. I just have this persistent sadness every time I look at my damn leg. I am in a boot that comes up to my knee for a while, at least until I see an ortho on the 20th to tell me different. I feel like crying but cannot in front of my support person. The earliest I can talk to someone is later this week so I guess I was needing to vent where people understand how hard it is to pretend to be okay when you really are not. Just feeling sad",0
I am under so much pressure to pass. If I do not pass my exam tomorrow I risk losing my scholarship and I will have to drop out. It is almost impossible for me to find a good job in my country without a degree so I will just end up homeless and die within a year anyways. I do not want that but all of this pressure is driving me crazy! I have not taken a break in three years. I am drained and I have been contemplating suicide a lot lately. It just feels like there is no place for me on earth anymore. University is making me want to kill myself,1
"Hey guys - I am 32M, and have had pretty severe depression and anxiety for many years now. When I think about it, I think it all started with my mother's death when I was a child, but for many years I buried everything, I got on with life, did not complain, went to school, went to work, did ok in life. But somewhere around the age of 21 I just cracked, I started having sleep problems, I felt anxious and depressed and even had nightmares about my mother a lot and I just could not function. But instead of seeking help I tried to just march on with life, as I had done before, but this time I was not able to. Things got worse, I was isolated, did not respond to messages/calls from people I knew, became more isolated and tried to commit suicide. I wish I had known that I was genuinely depressed. As strange as it sounds I had no idea what was going on with me. Not a single person noticed in my life, they were terrible with things like mental health etc. Not an ounce of support or understanding, just a tacit understanding that I should not talk about anything like this.I spent a period of 2-3 years pretty much bed ridden, even more isolated, lonely, health failing, mind crumbling. But with therapy and medication managed to crawl out of that hole. It has been 10 years now, 10 years of struggle and I still cannot believe it has been that long. I have been destitute, alone, isolated, homeless for a period, jobless for long stretches. Basically just so unwell that I was not able to ever plan for anything, or get my life back together. I was taking it an hour or a day at a time. There were days when just brushing my teeth was an achievement. But how could I explain this to someone? I could barely look after myself.I managed to start medication and get therapy and that was a huge help, and for the past 3 years or so I have been doing ok, but there are still moments when the pain I carry from those difficult years are hard to shake off. I thought I had friends, I thought I had family, but when the time came I was truly alone. Not a single person really helped me, and that broke my heart and changed many of my relationships. I do not feel the same, even though I still see some of these individuals...Anyway, long story short, I think I am doing ok now, but at times it really gets me down when I think of all the time I have lost, I know there is nothing I can do about it, and on better days I tell myself just to carry on and it will be ok. I try not to compare myself to friends or anyone else, but at times I look around and see people I know, people who were at one stage the same as me, and they are doing great in terms of career and relationships, and I am truly happy for them, but I see myself and it really crushes me. It dawns on me how truly sick I was and how much time I have lost, and it is hard to get myself out of that hole. I feel like I still struggle a lot and it has cost me relationships/friendships and also financially/career-wise. I look healthy, I am tall, have hair, in very good shape, but I cannot seem to tell anyone, a few times I have tried but how do you open up with such heavy stuff. Family members have just dismissed me, and acquaintances sometimes cannot believe me because they say I look like I am well. But deep inside, there are days and weeks where I feel such pain that I do not know if I can carry on.I do not know why I am posting this today, I have had an ok week, but this morning I woke up and just felt terrible. I am still on medication and yesterday picked up some more from the pharmacy. The only thing is because I take generic sertraline sometimes the brands change, I do not know if my mood has anything to do with the fact that I started taking another brand of sertraline the other day...but I just feel so low right now, have not felt like this in months, I feel like killing myself, it is a horrible soul-crushing feeling and I feel like I should hang myself to just stop feeling this. It just crept up on me all of a sudden. I know this sounds a bit negative but I just needed to reach out and talk to some fellow human beings, and just be heard and listened to, I do not have anyone I can tell and I feel like I am drowning right now. I feel such profound pain it is almost making me cry, which never happens. Like my mood is just out of whack and cannot be controlled.Please, anyone, help, suggest something or just say you hear me and that I am not alone. I really need to just talk to someone, or to be heard. Having a really bad day.",0
"i have thought about killing myself for 2 years. antidepressants gave me temporary relief from suicidal thoughts, but not anymore. I am beginning to think that I am treatment-resistant. &gt;!when i went to university, i thought about jumping off the bridge to the parking lot.!&lt; now that i am stuck at home, I have thought about different things. it is one of two things. &gt;!one, shooting myself with my father's gun. or two, stabbing myself in the gut with a knife from the kitchen.!&lt; I am safe for tonight, but i have one question: how do i cope with these thoughts? i cannot distract myself forever. 2 years",1
"It seems like I have woken up today, knowing and thinking about myself in full clarity. I am sitting at my desk thinking about the mistakes I have made at just 25 and I feel calm and scared and lost. Everything that has lead me here has been my fault, I have been manipulative as a second language and hurt the people who meant everything to me. My marriage failed because I held on to tight to her when she needed me to let go and now there is no words to say to apologize or take back the pain I caused by suffocating her and then eventually cheating on her. But she still crosses my mind everyday. Even the relationship I tried to do everything right in failed because I am inherently bad as a person. I was gaslighting you without even knowing it and I made you miserable to the point you had to fight the air in your lungs to get away, and ill never know how to make that right by you. But I hope someday you will forgive me.Even when I joined the navy to have some sense of normalcy and life, I messed that up and left with a little more in pocket than I meant to. Now I stay awake at night suffocating from the memories of almost dying and hope for the morning light to bring me life, but every part of me knows that if I had not been in that situation I would not be here in pain now. I am a terrible person and I know I do not deserve happiness or life. But I am calm knowing that and I am calm knowing that everything has to end. Somehow in the lowest I have ever felt I am also the calmest I have ever felt. For anyone who takes the time to read this. Thank you. Everything has to end",0
I am 26.

Hi everyone I am 32 year old male currently dealing with depression. Majority of my life I have been dealing with OCD/Anxiety mostly focused on having a serious illness. The constant worrying has put me in what i think is a serious deep depression. I have no emotion anymore. Nothing excites me i feel like I am just existing. I got engaged 2 months again and was not nervous no excitement no emotion i feel like i do not have emotion for much anymore. It honestly scares me. I been to psychologists and CBT never really helped.Thinking that i might need to go see a psychiatrist i feel like I am drowning here and i cannot get out its an awful feeling. I have start going back into work july 12 so that means 2:30 hour commute to the city one way. So my question is what have you done to help get out of this depression and if anyone deals with health anxiety what do you do. I feel like the health anxiety is what put me in the state. I worried for 2 months thinking i had skin cancer to get a biopsy and it was a mole and now i feel like there is a lump in my neck and the worse part about that is no one else feels it i went to urgent care and the doc said nothing is there. i keep making doc appointments thinking they miss something I am trying to save for a wedding and I am just spending money on docs. Please help. I need help but IDK where to begin.,0

"Every time something bad happens to me, why is it always my fault. Why does everyone including my family tell me to get over it and leave it in the past.

I am attempting to drown out the sorrow with high energy music, problem is, I have never been to a Psychologist yet and i still have a long wait ahead of me until i recieve my first. I am 27. And from the south.I ran away from there due to a bad relationship with my Ex. The woman who had my first and only bio child.We were both young and emotionally/mentally broken. We thought we wanted/needed a child to be valued and grow forward. The part we forgot to participate in was the self discovery and self exploration in the late teens to mid/early twenties.Instead we pushed different things into our relationship trying to bandage the scraps and bleeds. Day after day filled with yelling we degraded each other. And seeing as the south does not have any truely functioning mental health knowledge/system we had no idea what we where doing to each other and all the ramifications of those 6 years. I chose to remove myself from the situation (by moving to Oregon from Texas) because i felt that if i continued on that specific path that I would choose to off myself. Instead I chose more pain but higher benefit for my son, Live, and choose to learn to be better, so that he can have his father one day 100%.Now. I am in a relationship with a mother of two girls here, and while the circumstances have changed ""I"" have not i guess. Becquse the depression is getting worse despite having a seemingly healthier relathionship, and trying my FUCKING BEST every god damn day to learn about my demons and how to conquer the storm within, but it seems that between the pain of the trauma of the past, physical and mental PTSD from life..... IdkThis is a everyday hard god damn fight. And I am not going to give up. But fuckSitting here with my whiskey, smokes, smoke, and tears running down my face just wondering what the fuck I am doing and where the fuck I am going.

"I do not normally post these sort of things but figured I would give it a try.So here we go:I am 30 years old, live with my parents and I am in a low paying job that I am making no progress in but cannot just pack in. Things have not seemed to go right for many years, would not be surprised if it is my own damn fault but there you go.I suffered from Crohn's disease/ ulcerative colitis (unclear which) as a teenager. Fortunately we managed to get it into remission but now I suffer with IBS which is less serious but still very uncomfortable, irritating and humiliating. I think there is other things wrong but my gastroentorologist said no.I had wonderful, long curly hair as a teenager, now at 30 it has receded and thinned to the extent that I have less hair than a sphinx cat. Whilst I have come to terms with this (and believe me it took a while) it is still annoying to have this happen at such a young age.I have been a heavy drinker for many years, basically pissing away my entire wage down the pub. Around Christmas 2020 I managed to cut down significantly and was getting in shape and quitting smoking. However, it is gotten worse since the pubs reopened. As I am naturally shy alcohol opens me up and drowns sorrows. I have been getting plastered and end up messaging people on Facebook, most times it is benign but other times it is been very bad and I have made a prick of myself, been too drunk to know what I was doing but because I am used to messaging drunk my messages are legible if bizarre. I have lost friends and been borderline traumatised by what I have done..I am very romantically lonely, I am used to picking up after a beer, but this is not very frequent. Sometimes women have messaged me on FB for a hookup, but it is few and far between. One relationship I did want to work out was with a coworker, but it was very strange, she seemed to lead me and a few other coworkers on and now she is in a relationship with another woman. I am still upset about that it did not work out, I was under the impression she preferred women and I have not got a problem with that but I am sad it did not work out as I really cared for her.I seem to suffer an anxiety disorder, and possibly on the autistic spectrum but that is never been formally diagnosed. Might be a personality disorder but I do not know.As a key worker I have been working the entire pandemic, as its too cramped in the house I have been working in the office as it gets me out, around people and gives me a routine. The office is now very quiet as most people are content to work from home and have no urgency to return whilst they are permitted to work from home. The work is either very dull or needlessly complex, standard bureaucracy.Now things could be a lot worse and I am aware of that, I have a job and a place to sleep. And I am not saying it is anyone else's fault as I have been very unambitious my whole life. But I just feel completely lost, life going nowhere and like I am in purgatory. The old adage I hear when I mention I am stuck is "" only you can change things "" which is true but I just do not know what to do.I have no idea what to do at all. I just want to escape and start all over again but society is feeling very dystopian at the moment to me with this pandemic.Thank you for taking the time to read this. 30M life going nowhere, lost and feeling hopeless",0
"Because it is ""too easy to find a gf"" ? No it is not. Maybe for you. Not for me. Not for a lot of people I bet.I will do it anyway. Because as you get older its even harder. what is the point of living if you cannot get anything you want? Why should not I be depressed over being a virgin that cannot find a gf?",1

"I had a friend who dated this guy, who would not stop messaging her for several months after they broke up. Mind you, she has not responded to him.

Why do people think its okay to make suicide threats as a form of manipulation?",1
"maybe if my parents gave me the validation and love i needed i would not be so desperate for attention from random men on the internet. maybe if they cared about me i would not care too much about a suicidal mf who lives on the other side of the world. maybe if they loved me i would not be doing these things. maybe if they taught me to love myself i would not desperately need someone else to do so. maybe if they loved me i would not have to beg total strangers online for validation. maybe if my dad spent time with me and hugged me instead of taking me to the toy store and buying what i want i would not be so touch starved. maybe if my mom treated me good as a kid we would be close. maybe if i did not have to be my mom's parent, i would not care too much abt people who do not deserve it. maybe if my dad did not smack my ass and say that it was too small and that guys liked girls with big chunky asses, i would not be working out as much. maybe if they did not invalidate me everytime i tried to open up to them, i would not be venting to random strangers online. maybe if they showed me they loved me as a kid i would not feel worthless and undeserving of love all the time. maybe if they taught me to be open about my emotions i would not have have a hard time expressing myself. maybe if they listened to me when i begged them to take me to a therapist, i would not have gotten worse. maybe if they sat me down and talked to me instead of yelling at me and calling me a psychopath when they found out i cut myself, i would have stopped. maybe if they did not blame everything on me because I am the oldest child, i would not be blaming myself whenever a small inconvenience occurs. maybe if they showed that they cared about me when i was a kid, i would not think each person who cares about me a little too much is in love with me. maybe if my mom was a little gentle with me, i would not be too harsh on myself now. maybe if my dad was emotionally present when i was a kid, i would not be so used to people doing unreasonable shit. maybe if my dad did not always gaslight me into thinking i was crazy, I would be in a better place mentally. maybe if they believed me when i told them stuff I have never told anyone else, i would not have a fear that people might think I am lying when I am talking about something really serious. maybe if they took my mental health seriously, it would not have effected my grades. maybe if they said they loved me when i was a kid, it would not be hard for me to believe it whenever someone says that they love me. maybe... maybe",0

I am not sure why I cannot forget it. 3 years ago I took all my nerve together and told my mother how I feel and do not See any Point in Life and how I am thinking about Killing myself on the daily. She seemed to Care at First..Like 5 Minutes but after that she could not Care fucking less and I never talked about It ever again. It felt so...I do not know how to Put it in words. I felt dumb. Like this is some fucking endless cycle of pain I will never be able to escape in my Life. To this day I still often think about why I even bothered trying to get myself Help. I mean..I am Alive. So guesse life is Bearable enough for me to stay..somehow.. I still cannot forget the only time I actually tried to Reach Out for Help over 3 years ago,0
"I know it sounds silly...I have not watched that much anime, only yugioh when I was a child nor have I played any anime games.

All that 'help' from others and trying by myself has perhaps made me understand things better, though I still struggle in a big way.Fuck, I just want a talking octopus, a ninja cat and blossom tree to hug me, eat noodles with me then go longboarding or cycling through a lovely old lane.

Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I do not date anyone. Nothing really interests me so I do not have much to talk about. I suck at all conversations and once again I am so boring. When i was a kid I had a personality I was funny and goofy and happy. Now I am just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I cannot come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I want to be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I am not that. I know its depression that causes it. Depression makes me SO boring,0

"I have had this depression for years, I get meds and go to a therapist but lately it is been so bad that I have seriously thought aboyt hurting myself. I know I cannot do it because I am conscious of what I could because to people who care about me but i still think about doing it. One night i took 4 anxiety pills which it is more than I should take but I knew it would not because any harm, even If i knew that I went to sleep hoping I would die while sleeping or at least feel better when I woke up. Instead I woke up without the anxiety I had but feeling more depressed, without energy and not wanting to do anything even if I had lots of work to do. I stayed in bed all day, sleeping and not even looking at my phone, I ate just once that day. No one insisted that I got out of bed since i said i was feeling sick. Now I have even more things to do because I lost that entire day.

Please give me ideas of what to do other than that. I do not play video games anymore and have been rejecting social meetings with friends so I am looking for other things to do and hopefully I will feel better and go back to going out and stuff.

"We have not spoken for months because my depression made me act too dependent and downright mean sometimes. We agreed it was in our best interests to freeze the friendship for a while until I got better.At multiple occassions (because I impulsively made contact anyways) he assured me now was not the time but there would be a time in the future for us to catch-up and start over as it were. During all this I still did not get better. My depression got way worse and I got heavily suicidal.Today it has been almost 4 months since my last small impulsive message (and about 8 or 9 months since we stopped propely talking), and I found out he blocked me on Instagram and Facebook, our main ways of communication. I checked with dummy accounts to see if I was really blocked or just doom-thinking, but I am blocked. He already stopped following on Spotify a few months ago and at the same time removed me as his Insta follower, but this is a whole new step.I know how pathetic it is, but this really makes me want to end it all. I care so much about him, and he does not care about me, seemingly. He ends our friendship in secret by blocking me. It might even have happened 3 months ago, I only just found out by investigating myself. I apparently have not even earned enough respect and love to get a message. If he does not care about me, then no one does. My sense of self-worth is so rooted in others loving me, and I cannot handle this right now. just found out my best friend blocked me everywhere",1

I am in my early twenties and things have been bad for so long I feel like it will never get better. I have relapsed into sh pretty bad again and I feel like now all I need is a little push. If anyone knows any self destructive/triggering movies similar to Suicide Room please let me know. Part of me just wants to completely spiral so I can finally end it all. It does not get better.",1

And if my parents were here, I would not ever seek support from them, because my father is a tyrant and I hate him. I am 32, I do not have a paid job here, I am a teacher in training and that training will last till the end of 2021. But above all this, I really loved my husband. I do not want to 'seek for a right guy' and marry again. Been there, done that. Having a family has always been the most important thing for me, since I come from a wrecked, fucked-up family. Now it is gone, and I do not want to live anymore. I want to commit suicide, because this entire world is just a big hole full of shit. I try to come up with the reasons why I should not do this, but cannot find a single worthy one. I do not want to live anymore.",1

Hi I am lost an I do not know what I can do to help, I have done and tried everything I can possibly do",0
"I do not know what it is, I do not even know if its by the faults of my own doing or if there is an alternate source, whether it be internal or external, that continues to bash me on the head with ideas and thoughts that are not my own, ones that I feel cannot possibly be at my own doing. My names Nat. I am 16, trans (she/they), and autistic. All of these play a factor into what I feel may be underlying factors playing into my depression and self-sabotaging tendencies. It seems as if every friendship or relationship I have is toxic in some regard, mostly due to my influence. I am horrible at making new friends, so whenever an old friendship has officially concluded I continue to try and call them back to me, so I no longer will bathe in my own desperations and self-loathing ideologies. I beg and make a fool of myself. And the few friendships I have maintained have only been at the expense of others. Even if they say they do not mind caring for me and helping me through these problems, even if they are also there to lend a helping hand, I never feel as though I do enough in return to grasp it and accept it, that is, their love. I make a bigger deal out of problems constantly, and have no reasonable output or control of my emotions. Something as small as someone leaving me on Read can lead me down a dark spiral into depressing thoughts and much darker ideas. I feel I am not one singular person, but many different people trying to take control of a body that refuses to cooperate. The small glimpses of happiness and fulfillment are quickly overshadowed by long, drawn-out periods of mania and depression. I never feel happy with life anymore. Even when I am enjoying life, I always have a feeling in the back of my mind that I could be doing better, that I could be getting more out of life.For example, I started my first job yesterday and I loved it. The people there were really nice and helpful, and despite not wanting to work in Fast Food, I really enjoyed my time at Sonic working there. But last night I had a breakdown because I kept thinking of all the little mistakes I made and how I felt I would stay where I was and continue falling behind my coworkers. I feel as if I do not deserve peoples sympathy and love, but at the same time, crave it more than anything. I am willing to completely change who I am for someone I find admirable. My life at this point has no balance, and the smallest hint of work or anything adult like college and taxes, I shut down and am unable to function like a normal human being. Something as simple as my friend saying Sorry for not texting back, I was at work makes me want to dispose of my phone and hide away in my room from everyone, to shut myself in from the outside world. Because I feel inferior to them, I feel I could somehow be better, even if they and I are on a similar level of ability. Even now, as of writing this, I feel like I am over exaggerating, that maybe things are not as bad as I put them. After all, even if it is rare, I still can be happy. A vent",1

"Sorry if this sort of thing is not allowed, I just need to tell someone.I tried to kill myself when I was six, and once again a year later. I have never stopped being suicidal, I had to go to the hospital when I was 14 because I felt like I would kill myself. Since I was 12-13, I have been planning on killing myself when I am 19, the only reason why I did not kill myself when I was 14 was because I wanted to give myself a few more years for my life to get better. I have 2 years until I am 19, my life has only gotten worse. I have been saving up to get a (mentally) life saving surgery when I am 18. My family struggles with money and my dad does not pay child support, I want to kill myself so the money for the surgery can go to my family. Paying for one funeral will be a lot cheaper than spending money on me for the rest of my life when I will never even be happy. depressed",0
"I have been having suicidal ideation nearly every day for the past few years and the older I get, the worse it gets. At this point killing myself feels inevitable. I am taking a break from school and my student loans will be due soon which has been making me feel like I have to just do it. My parents took out tens of thousands in parent loans as well and considering I do not have a degree or a well paying job there is no way I could possibly help to pay it back. And how could I ask them to pay for that when they already are only just scraping by? Killing myself has always felt like the way things will end for me as I have a lot of trouble connecting with people and I really do not want to be alone for another fifty plus years. That being said, it has always felt far away. So now with my student loans looming I feel like its probably coming to be time and its freaking me out a bit to be honest. I have no one to discuss this with (my mom yelled at me when I had tried to discuss this with her a few years ago) so I just needed to write this and put it somewhere. Sorry if I have broken any rules of this sub I have never been here before. feels inevitable at this point",1

I am so lonely, I am constantly thinking about the future, the past, and i do nothing to fix either of them. i feel like I am nothing, I am so useless and unimportant. i hate who i am and who I have been, i know i can change but i do not even know how to change the things i do not like myself. utter hopelessness",0

"I just feel constantly guilty. I feel guilty when I am not depressed because I am a pretentious smartass that has to tell his opinion on everything all the time. I feel guilty when I am depressed because people around me feel like they are the reason for it, which they are not but also kind of are. I hate people and I hate myself the most.

Yea, my face is fine but you would be surprised how much a persons body is important. I tried putting on weight, but its very difficult. VERY difficult. I just want to be accepted. It hurts so bad knowing most men only prefer curvy women (which i totally understand, i wish I could have their bodies). I am really praying my metabolism slows, I just went to be a normal weight. Even to gain a simple pound, Id have to eat 3500 calories and even that is a lot of good everyday. At least for meI truly think my body is cursed :/ My body makes me harm myself",0

"I plan to die around the end of November, I know what date I am going to do it and I have some ideas on how I am going to die. I chose November because my big important essay is due, and I do not want to waste my effort from writing the first and second drafts. Another reason is because I was suppose to die on the same day a few years ago but I had to go somewhere.I have been feeling like shit for years, especially this summer. My old therapist ( last meeting was 3 years ago, 9th grade, first suicide attempt ) gave me meds that did not even work ( 50mg and only 8 tablets, and its fucking expensive ) and his last advice was to ""have fun"". Yeah thanks a lot. I have been coping in a really bad way, but I do not know if I am ready to give it up.School-wise I am doing fine, but my parents are hell-bent on making me go to college in my home country ( because the school gave me the wrong term 3 results ) and I do not want to go there because of its conservative laws and I have views that can get me killed or shunned, a shit ton of victim-blaming and overall I just want to go far away from my parents because they treat me like I am 5. My mom insists that I stay at home and go to online-school when I am in college, and it made everything worse. I said to myself ""I would rather kill myself than be with them"" I do not know what major I want to be in, I just want to move out. I do not know why, but this subreddit makes me feel safe for telling all of this. I do not know where to get better advice. I lost my reason to live, I do not know what to do.I will do an update if I am alive by then. I want to end it all",1
"I imagine the seemingly normal things I am going to do on my last day, and then the part when I end it all. Thinking about that part fills me with a sense of calmness. Finally being able to escape my problems. Finally leaving the shitty people who make my life miserable. Its all I have ever wanted, and death will give it to me. do not tell me it gets better, because the chances of my situation getting better are not guaranteed. Dying does scare me a little bit, but if I do not die now, I will inevitably die later in life. Why live in pain for longer? Death is bliss, and I want the courage to meet up with it. Thinking of killing myself makes me really happy",1

"it is not the first time in my life when I feel so sad that I cannot even watch YouTube or Netflix, like I do not feel like doing that at all. My only entertaiment these days is reddit and 4chan because I still find interesting to read other people and feel that someone is reading me. I feel I do not should feel bad. I have kind of a ""dream job"" (I think I am going to fuck it up tho and I do not feel like working these days but I have to) but these lasts months I have ben struggling with anxiety kind of hard. I have never felt that before, anxiety is the worst thing that could happend and It fucked me up so much. Now when I think about seeing my girlfriend I get scared bc I feel I am going to have anxiety and feel uncorfomtable with her. I like her and I do not want to lose her, but I feel like I cannot be with her anymore, the realationship literalmente produces me a lot of anxiety, like the fear of losing her due to anxiety produces me the anxiety. I do not know, but now that I feel we are about to break up the anxiety status has become sadness. I just feel so sad. I have been drunk for three days and now I am sober I just want to drink again or smoke some pot. I kind of now that no one's going to read this or answer this, but writing it has made me spend a few minuts of my day and that is what I wanted. Spending my time on something. I cannot anymore with life, it is not the first time that I experiencie this feeing of total sadness and I just cannot stand another month like this. I just need someone to read me",0
"I want to know about this one because my girlfriend kept on telling me that. Before it happened, she was ranting about her Uncle who keeps on letting her dog out (the reason why she does not wants it out is because of the parvo virus or any infectious diseases that her dog might get). I was kind of sleepy during that time and was falling asleep but when she calls, I suddenly wake up. The moment she knew about me, falling asleep, she became even furious and kept on throwing she wants every people to die but also tells I should die first then my family next. She also does not wants me to eat. Is this normal? Is wanting someone or all people die inclined with depression or any other mental illness?",0

In what world do you think I want to talk to some joe shmo cop who does not give a shit if he had to scrape me off the pavement or talk me out of suicide? If give it to you, I want to talk to you. Gave my ex gf a letter explaining my feelings.... do not recommend.",1
"I am constantly crying myself to sleep over the pain of not being able to kill myself. I do not have a horrible life but it feels so routine and its exhausting. I find myself wanting to just end things because its just SO MUCH easier. But every time I have thoughts of suicide I just think about how my mom already lost one son and her husband, I cannot put her though that again. I cannot hurt my family and friends that I know care for me but I just do not feel close to them anymore. I feel like the affection or compassion I show towards them are fake. All my emotions I show them feel so forced. I cannot even say I love you to my family without cringing. I just want to rest peacefully and the thoughts of hurting the people around pain me. How is that fair! Its not their life, its mine. I should be able to do what I want. Its selfish that people want me to say alive because they will miss me. This constantly battle of wanting to die but I cannot kill myself hurts and I just bottle it up until it all comes out in tears and I am just left sleeping of exhaustion.I have never attempted to kill myself but I am afraid one day, probably when my mom goes, Ill end up doing it. And I cannot bring myself to talk to anyone because I can never be so open with anyone, not my family and not even my girlfriend to an extent. Maybe I should try therapy but every experience I hear from people is horrible. So I am just forced to sleep it off and when I am asleep it all just goes awaythe pain, the exhaustion, the pressure. Its the best feeling in the world. The best drug. I just cannot stop crying",1
"I know the title for this post is strange, but this is truly how I feel, and have been feeling for a while now. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. I also have OCD and autism, so it makes my life a little bit harder than normal. Through all of the struggles and dark times I have, I cannot stop thinking about how much I want someone, anyone, to just hold me in their arms and give me a long hug. It probably would not help in the long term, but it would just be a temporary relief for me with the way I am feeling. For someone to just hug me for a minute would make so much of a difference you would not believe, but unfortunately I do not have anyone around me right now who could do that. Like I said, I would not just be permanently healed from this, but it would be a temporary fix at least. Sorry for this weird post, but I just wanted to vent a little. Thanks for reading. I think a hug would make me feel better",0

These people talk dirt about people that do not work and hope they end up poor and in the dirt, bc well they worked for it, despite the societal benefits they took to achieve it. I want to threaten to kill people like this, bc I do not like the attitude and I am jealous of what they have. I sometimes seriously want to do something to people like this, despite the consequences. Is that bad? I know exactly how successful people talk",0

"// Sorry if this whole post is a mess, my mind is a huge mess atm // Anybody out there who grew up without proper adult supervision or is currently doing so? Man, if you are, I have deep respect for you and you deserve nothing but the best in life. I live this way too and it is the worst. I am currently 15 years old and I have been living without proper adult supervision for nearly 3 years. People might think living with no house rules, no discipline, no anything might be the best, but it is nothing like that for me. Basically, I live with a lazy cousin who does almost nothing else but play games and shit even though he is 22. And my guardians who are supposed to be taking care of me are miles away from the house I live in. For the past couple of years, I have been raising my own self aside from financial support (which I am thankful for but it is not enough), pretty much trying to figure everything out all alone. Before this all happened to me, I had a pretty normal life, wherein I was kind of dependent on my parents on everything. But I mean, c'mon, parents are there to give children what they need - time, love, and their basic needs, you know. So moving onto this kind of lifestyle after I lost my parents was really tough. I had to deal with mourning their loss, moving into a new city, school, home, changing my lifestyle completely, and leaving my friends, my old house all behind altogether. And I was pretty much alone throughout all of it because nobody my age could understand how I felt, and my guardians who are supposed to be looking out for me kind of always just leave me alone. Sure, it might not be the hardest thing ever for some people, but it really has been for me. Fast forward to nearly 3 years of living this kind of life, it is only gotten worse. The house I live in is always under heavy neglect because of my failure to keep up with all the chores, and my cousin literally not helping but just adding to the mess. The dishes always pile up, we seldomly take out the trash so that piles up too, there are so many containers in the fridge with unfinished food that has been there for several months, the back area is infested with insects and snails, parts of our rooves are leaking, our gardens are ridiculously overgrown and were always late on restocking groceries, etc. I could keep going on and it just gets worse and worse. To add to that, we do not eat healthy foods and only eat 1-2 times a day, we just eat processed foods or fast foods, plus we do not get any exercise either. Our lives are disgusting, and I really wish I had the strength to persevere and change our lives but.... it is been so tough being in all of this alone. I always try to initiate changing our lives, but every time I do so, hoping I would motivate my cousin to help me, he does not help me. He still stays lazy while I try and fix our lives and it really takes a huge toll on me and always affects my progress because I just wish he would help. Lately, I have been dealing with so much more to the point I have nearly attempted to leave the world for good several times. I thought, I just rather be with my mom now. This is because my aunt who lives halfway across the world decided that I was going to get two puppies. do not get me wrong, I love dogs so much, but they are not suitable for the kind of lifestyle I have right now. And now I feel so overwhelmed with how untidy and messy our house is, but the dogs are already here. I feel so bad for them, I feel like they deserve a much better home. And it is also been a struggle to take care of them personally. Because I feel like I am failing them and not providing everything they need. they are both big breed dogs, which I have never had so everything with them is a new experience for me. I feel like I am not giving them the proper lifestyle they need so it is been so stressful. Plus, again, as expected, my cousin is not helping. He does not even at least pet them or play with them, you know? And it hurts me so much. I live in a middle to upper-class town but my life is pretty close to how people in poverty live or even worse, because at least some of them still manage to have fun and have loving families. This place is the most depressing place I have ever seen and lately, I have just realized how emotionally neglected I am. it is been nearly 3 years since my mom passed away but I have not even gotten close to moving on. The thought of her being gone has been and still is so heartbreaking and always brings me to tears. And nobody in my family has bothered to sit down with me and ask me how I am doing or how I am coping. it is just been so dead in the house I live in, especially for the past year and a half in quarantine. My cousin and I barely talk unless we go outside to run errands. He just stays in his room all day and does not bother helping out with the house. I swear to god, I have contemplated just going away for good so many times. This fucking life is horrible and I want to escape so badly and be with my mom in heaven. The only thing that is stopping me now are my dogs, I love them too much now to leave them behind knowing that they might not be taken care of properly. So I really am trying my best to muster up the strength to fix my life, without the feeling of needing my cousin to be as productive as me. But I just find it so hard, depression just does that to you, I guess. I just wish things get better and I wish I continue to fight for myself and my dogs. Ps. I am not really looking for pity, we all have our own tough challenges in our lives, and this is my battle to fight. I would absolutely appreciate it though if those with the same experiences comment down below and let me know how you managed to get out of it and get better. Or at least what you do to cope. I am 15, and I have been realizing how emotionally neglected I'am by my family.",0
"i just want a hug.the only person I have ever fallen in love with hates me, makes fun of me, yells at me and ignores me when i try to express how i feel. my sister ignores me and only texts me when she needs something from me. my mother tries to convince herself that she is proud of me but she is truly disappointed in who i am and is not very good at hiding it. I like art and music but I am painfully bad at both. I look forward to nothing. I am financially well off and feeling this way while being so privileged just makes me feel like such a waste of space. a waste of protons, brain waves, oxygen, food, water, money. I am a parasite. if I write a will stating that i need my money to go to several orgs and then off myself, would that work? Or should i send all of it off first? Idk how much longer i can wait.6 months ago I felt good and like i had grown from my first attempt. I have drive to go back to school and to make friends and be happy. Looking back I feel like that version of me was like paper, so unstable and so unaware of how simple minded i was. Then I met someone and fell in love. I have never wanted to marry someone and spend my life with someone before. and he hates me. he makes me hurt on purpose and yells at me to overwhelm me. he talks down to me and asks me why things are so hard for me to understand. but I am really starting to think its just my fault. I kind of deserve it. No one else would deserve it, but I do. I am autistic, so maybe i am just really stupid. maybe i provoke him every time without realizing or trying. maybe I am just especially annoying and awful to be around. I feel like I do not belong anywhere. Nobody wants me. I do not have any friends because i stopped texting them back. I do not have the energy to make new friends. I rarely go outside because I feel like I am in everyone is way. I miss my dogs. I just want a hug. I am so beyond tired and I have been looking for ways to do it but i cannot figure out what to do. I do not want to scar anyone or hurt anyone. I just want to go away and disappear. I was never meant to be on this planet in the first place. I was curious about how to get to the roof of a really tall building in the city closest to me, but maybe i would just be arrested for trespassing if i tried to split off from a tour and find my way up there? i want my mind to stop working and to end the stream of my consciousness and knowledge of my own personality and existence as soon as possible. i am truly alone and undeserving",1

This world is awful, the longer I stay in this planet, the more problems I see in this planet. I have been down by these past months because of this mindset of mine and I do not know what to do.

"Maybe it will be a huge paragraph but please read this. I am trying my best to explain the whole thing so you can realize how much I am going thorugh. Maybe your little suggestion will save my life.I am going to start off by saying, English is not my mother language and I am trying my best to express my feelings and thoughts.I am a 17 years old boy who is living in an abyss. and My family problems are getting bigger and bigger. My dad mentally abuses my mom and me and it is getting worse and worse.My dad's been cheating on my mom for like a couple of years and I knew it from the beginning. I did not know what to do as I was so young and lost. My mom just found out all the things and she reached out to my dad asking about the things he is been doing for years. He just said, ""If you talk about this ever again or tell anyone else about this, I will leave you two (Me &amp; my mom). He even tells my mom to die so he can marry another person. Last night, my mom was arguing with my dad about the fact that he is still cheating on my mom, so he just smashed his phone as my mom found out all the proves of himself cheating on my mom. Then he even tried to start throughing stuffs but I somehow managed to stop it.I wanted to leave my dad and move to somewhere else with my mom but I live I am a country where you cannot get jobs at this age. I mean, You can but the salary/payment is too low that I cannot even feed my mom. so, I am basically stuck in this maze and cannot get out.I am super introverted but I have a couple of friends and I tried to reach out to them but they were nothing but a couple of judgemental dudes.My dad is giving my mom a very little amount of money since my birth and he never gives us even a dollar more than that but my mom somehow manages to pay all the bills and everything (my dad does not spend his money on our familg, he just give my mom a littile amout). My mom does not buy anything for me but she tries her best to give me the things I want and everything. But whenever my mom buys something for me even when it is necessary, My dad just swears at my mom and mentally abuses her for no reason. on the other hand, my dad gets busy buying super expensive clothes for the other person.Recently, my dad's been acting crazy so mom tired to reach out to the other person but that women is nothing but a shameless person, just like my dad. IDK WHAT TO DO NOW, I JUST cannot SIT HERE AND LET MY MOM SUFFER FROM THIS ABYSS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT OUT OF HERE AND LIVE A HAPPY LIFE. RECENTLY, I am FEELING LIKE I NEED SOMETHING SUPER ADDICTIVE SO I CAN PUT MY BRAIN AWAY FROM THE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. Idk what to do, maybe I will end up being a drug addict or killing my self. I am going to end up killing myself just because of my dad",1

"I have always struggled with my mental health. I have severe severe anxiety and paranoia, probably sprung from a decade of drug and alcohol abuse in my 20s. I was doing so well since I knocked the drugs on the head at 29. But my paranoia has never disappeared. I am in a relationship with an incredible woman, but I have started slipping back into drug abuse again, and I feel like I am being gaslighted and I am unsure how to separate reality from fiction. That makes my innate paranoia a thousand times worse. I have no real way of coping with my paranoia soI dive back into smashing the booze and the booze almost always always leads to drugs which has lead me to being suicidal again. Its just easier not to have to think. I feel like a complete and utter burden to every single person I have in my life, I am fucking rubbish, no one should have to deal with my issues because I cannot keep my shit together. I feel like I have no worth, like I cannot get anything right in the world at all, I am a constant train wreck I simply cannot function with my thoughts. I have reached out desperately for help yesterday and today and have been met with little to no support or understanding from my family and friends. The crux does seem to be the gaslighting. It is really, really, really killing me and I need to know how to just drop the thoughts that things do not add up and simply trust her. I have been told by the family I have reached out to that I am selfish for seriously considering fucking hanging myself but how is it selfish to not want to live in constant, unending mental anguish and torment. I do not know what to do. I do not know what I need to feel better. I do not know how I can cope with all the thoughts swirling around in my mind or even remotely where to start. Its going to be much simpler to kill myself because I absolutely cannot deal with this shit. I am an awful fucking human being and the world would be better off without me. I cannot keep on rallying. It gets harder and harder the olde I get. Yesterday was my 33rd birthday and I have not wanted to kill myself as much as I did yesterday morning and today.",1
I am scared to go pick it up.and I did not buy ammunition for it but.

"I got fired from my job of 5 years in November. It was rather sudden and unexpected. In March I got a job but the hours were not what I wanted and my anxiety was through the roof. I quit before my training ended. Beginning of June I got real sad and decided to apply to a bunch of places got 2 no's. Got a call back for one but I was out of town and unable to make the interview. On our way home I got a call from another place to go in for an interview. That one I was able to make. It was group interview a little nerve raking but I thought I did well. They did too. Two days later they called for a second interview. I went into that one and did well, so well I was offered a higher position than what I was expecting and at full-time which I was also not expecting. Of course I said yes. But now I am not sure if I am ready after all. I started yesterday and it went well. But I am scared I will not like it or that I will let them down and not end up being who they thought I was when they hired me. Or that if I do not like it I will be letting my wife down. What if I made a mistake? My Dr today said we still need to work on my ""what if"" thinking and that maybe I have some imposter syndrome going on. How do you calm your anxiety? I start getting sad for my old job and old friends. And then I think about how much I miss my grandma. I just do not know what to do. I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings. New Job Anxiety",0

"I am 20 (f) and have been struggling with depression and generalized anxiety for as long as I can remember, but recently I have gotten to an all time low. I am enrolled in university and everyone around me has some sort of experience in their field at this point, while all I have under my belt is a seasonal job at a candy shop from highschool. I feel undeserving of every opportunity handed to me, as I have not genuinely had to work for it (father was a veteran so my tuition is paid for). My friends are all starting to become financially independent and all I have done is scrape by at school and game all day while feeling sorry for myself. I desperately want a job but the fear of actually having an interview and human interaction after spending so much time alone is so overwhelming to me. I constantly think about the fact that if I cannot handle what is happening right now, I would not last a second in the real world, and that makes me want to end it all. what is ironic about all of this is that I started pursuing a degree in abnormal psychology so I could help people like me, yet I cannot even help myself.

Get ready for the deep end and welcome to a world of finance, unnecessarily long work shifts, ready to give your hand in marriage and the expectation that it will all go smoothly,"" type of thing. it is the summer holidays, i finished my first year of college with my last year waiting on the horizon. Basically managed to pull reasonable scores on my tests that were extremely underwhelming to what my predicted grades were, but with half-assed, half-finished assignments, what else was i to expect? Cried an unnecessary amount of times and skipped multiple classes on the panic-induced decisions of having my mind blanc out and forgetting which room my lectures were held in. I hate it. I hate life. I hate myself. I hate everything that was and is to come. How am i going to live in a society where people expect so much of me, when i cannot even get through my academic years smoothly. People advise me to ""do my best,"" when me trying my best is doing the bare fucking minimum. I give up. I am incapable of doing such simple things. I cannot fucking stand it. And i do not plan on experiencing life past 18. Adulthood sucks and I am not even there yet. In a few months i will officially be an adult. I am not ready and i never will be.",1
"Okay, I do not know where to start and it is going to be pretty unorganised. And I cannot completely express myself, so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig, I not sure.I am introvert, antisocial, athiest , logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage , you know , so that they feel it ig , that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday , shouting and wasting your time , just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you , I do not want to talk to you, but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep, I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made , how stupidly wrong they were , it is not like I am correct, but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words , it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain, is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like , I cannot do anything now , I do not care , I will just move on, but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that, why did not I say that and get depressed everytime. I am sure that I am going to struggle my entire life and end up destroying opportunities and just imagine how my life would have been better. I am lonely , never been in a relationship and have few online friends which is another source of depression and there are more things . Sorry if I have been just repeating topics also it was not as interesting and thank you if you read all of this . Idk why am I sharing this , idc about upvotes, It is just like when I am explaining about how wrong people were about the concepts , to myself, which does makes me somewhat happy ig ,but I end up in depression again , bc that is not going to happen. It always ends up in my mind.",0
"Hi. I am turning 18 soon, and to day I had an appointment to schedule my classes. Nothing special, just community college. Anyway, my mom tried to talk to the guidance counselor, and he asks my mom ""is she a mute or does she speak?"". I have been suffering from social anxiety for years. It hurt so much. I wound up missing most of my sophomore and junior years of high school, because I would have panic attacks during classes. I was afraid to go. I was given a 504, an IEP, put on homeschooling, and put in psych wards, but nothing made it any better. I have been in therapy since 7th grade, but my lately mom just keeps cancelling my appointments because it is convenient for her. I never thought I would make it this far in life. And I truly wish I would ended it when i was much younger. My mom is just adding fuel to the fire, she keeps telling me to ""grow up"" and to ""get my shit together"". She was angry at me because i had to be put in a remedial math class because i failed math due to my absences. She does not want to pay for a class that will not get me any credits. I do not think i can handle college. I am so hopeless.TLDR: Wishing I would ended it in middle school like I thought I would because I am too mentally ill to handle college I should have ended it when I had the chance",1

"Somehow I managed to not think about my depression for nearly 3 years, I can hardly believe it. I am posting just so I can feel that I have talked to someone. Something happened a few days ago, my girlfriend basically treated me like I was a child, it is the first time that is happened and I did not let it slide, I got upset and even apologized for getting upset later, she never apologized back.I guess what was keeping everything back was pretty fragile because just a couple days stuck in my head has brought me all the way back to my emotional health when I was 17, I really do not know what to do, maybe letting the feelings pass will be good enough, but I think I just needed someone to talk to, or at least to pretend.

it is not going to be focused on something because I cannot focus on anything so yeah. I am 19 now. I feel like I am losing my mind. I feel empty all the time so I eat too much and buy stuff. I am going crazy. I cannot think anymore cannot concentrate. My memory is not working and my body is not what it used to be. I hate myself. I constantly look at myself in the mirror and judge the way I look. I try to diet everyday but soon after I break down. I am hungry I am thirsty for that sweet taste of food. that is the main thing in my mind all the time. that is what will fill me up when I feel down. So I eatBut then I feel worst because I gain fat and I hate myself more.When I sit in groups I do not understand what is going on. I ask questions and then ppl say I talk too much. But when I do not say anything no one notices me. I am always the one out. The one ignored. The weird crazy psychopath one. They call me psycho as a joke but it is not funny anymore. Yeah I get hyper and energetic sometimes. I do not know how to deal with all those energies that somehow I feel empty again so guess what I do? Eat.What is wrong with meWhy am I like thisI keep thinking about the days I was 5 yo and I was happy and hopeful. When my parents were young and everything and everyone were happier. Today there is mostly sadness. I am so tired of all the thoughts and feelingsI just want to sleep and not wake upI just want a shot that will make my mind quiteI do not want to be here nor there I do not want to be Sorry I am here to vent.. and I do not know why I post this but I guess I just cannot keep my feelings for myself anymore,0

"So... I never anticipated or expected myself to find myself in a place like this. But since I do not have anybody else to talk to I might aswel vent here before I decide to off myself. &amp;#x200B;So today I lost my job. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming from miles away but on the other hand, I wish it did not happen or atleast I would wish to be able to turn back time to prevent some things from happening. But we do not have such a thing, so my life is fucked either way.So, the first week of 2020 I gave up a deadbeat, no life job for something promising, something with a future. Raised out of a family where such a thing is an impossibility, I could have atleast try. Everything was fine, I loved the job, It was physical, it was a challenge, I felt... Happy. 3 months later, I find myself in hospital. I broke my ankle at my job. Again, in hindsight, my fucking mistake. I twisted my ankle at a location where it happened once shortly before, but a donkey does not hit the same rock twice in a row right? Right. I spend 2 months in a cast, longer than what was expected and another month out of the cast before I could even attempt going to work. That should have raised an alarm bell. I wanted to go back to work, so I went earlier than what was recommended. And such, I went to work; They gave me adjusted work, essentially I had to sit in an office like space, controling valves, pumps and monitors. But no matter what I did, how patient my boss was the pain endured. And weeks of adjusted work became months, months turned into a year. The pain stayed the same to the cost of several different treatments. Every step I take on that foot is the same as getting stabbed. Even when I did not stand on it for 4 hours, 10 minutes of walking made the pain come back, 50x worse than it was before. And as my inactivity began to extend, so did my weight. And in the meantime, gossip &amp; bullying started to become a regular occurence. To the point where the bullies claimed I did not deserve a lunch break, or that I am doing nothing but sit on my ass an entire day... I had multiple talks about it, every time the promise of betterment was made. But every time, the bullying became worse. My mental state began to decline. Up to the point where I left half an hour earlier because I could not take the abuse no more and told my boss how I felt. And so, I was brought up for a final conversation. I could not even defend myself this time. ""it is time to let you go"", and was ordered to give everything back, from keys to badge... &amp;#x200B;This job was all I had. it was my jumpstart to a better life, a one time opportunity that was wasted because of a fucking accident that dominated my entire career. And it is all my fault. If I was not fat, my ankle could heal properly. If I did not show anger and frustration all the time, I could have kept my job.If I was not honest about how I felt, I could have kept my job. At home, I have nothing, nobody. Because of Corona, all my friendships watered down to the point where they did not reply back. Work was all I had. And now I do not have anything. Nobody to talk to, nobody to vent to. Alone, at the age of 26. Sad fuck. For years I have felt miserable but it was do-able, manageable even. But now I feel worse than that. A sorrow that drowns me out with no sign of ever getting better, not to mention the physical pain I have at the moment. I cannot take it no more... If I was not this ugly blob of meat I could have had somebody to support me right now. I am going to OD myself on both pain, antidepressants and alchohol later this week and pray it works. I am just going to make some arrangements until then. &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to share my story for the record. Even though it is vague and incomplete. Alright, so... I lost my job today and now I got nothing left.",1

"Hi everyone. I am a 23 year old male nurse that has been working for three years now. I was diagnosed with Major Depression while I was in High School along with anxiety, and Tourette Syndrome. I have been battling suicidal thoughts ever since then and I have been hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric facility three times. I cannot remember if being inpatient actually helped me though. I have been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a little over a year and have had two acute series done. The ECT has ruined my memory and it does not seem to be helping any longer. I had a treatment done on Monday and was already feeling severely depressed and suicidal by Tuesday night. I do not know what to do.I could commit myself again, but my brother's white coat ceremony is coming up and I need my PTO to be able to fly out there to see it. I also do not want my family to worry. I love them and they are the only reason that I have not killed myself yet. I also do not even know if its worth it. I have been inpatient three times already and the suicidal thoughts are still there. I do have a couple of good things going on in my life though. I have a great job and a extremely loving family that is almost always willing to put up with a call from me because I know it helps my depressed mood. I have told everyone that I talk to regularly (my brother, sister, aunt, uncle, Dad, and Mom) that I have been feeling down and that talking to them helps improve my mood. However, I have been struggling with the feeling that I am starting to call them too often. I just do not want to bother them. To make things worse, my therapist is currently on maternity leave. I have a substitute therapist but that just is not the same. On top of my depression, my anxiety is so severe that I am unable to make friends. I have not had a friend since high school and that was only because I was friends with my twin brother's friends. I just get so flustered when I am around people that I can barely talk. I have no work friends, they all just know me as the quiet guy. I do not know. Everything just feels like too much. I am so tired and frustrated. I am just ready for everything to be over. I have feel like I have been suicidal for most of my adult life",0

"It comes from Suetonius, and I heard that the historian is not a particularly reliable one, but still the idea itself is interesting.**The passage**: Since ancient usage made it impious to strangle maidens, young girls were first violated by the executioner and then strangled. Those who wished to die were forced to live; for he \[Tiberius\] thought death so light a punishment that when he heard that one of the accused, Carnulus by name, had anticipated his execution \[and killed himself\], he cried: ""Carnulus has given me the slip""; and when he was inspecting the prisons and a man begged for a speedy death, he replied: ""Ihave not yet become your friend."" Death being a light punishment - I cannot quite explain it, but it feels so realistic/true. ""Carnulus has given me the slip"" - that one should answer your question of ""Why am I forced to live"". It is not beneficial for society if you kill yourself, for it loses a working unit and you set up a bad example (if that one escaped, I can too).P.S. The first sentence of the passage is not about suicide, but I left it in so your love for this world would rise a bit more. Emperor Tiberius on suicide",1

"tw: death""Existential dread"" I have heard the phrase thrown around a lot but did not really know what it means. I think it was triggered after my grandpa died, and my mom turning 50, and being left alone with my thoughts during the summer. I do not know how to cope with it, but I have tried to stay out of my room. I only go in there to sleep - and I have been waking up at 4 AM every day to sit in the car for hours. Then I will take midol and fall asleep at 8 PM. I stopped showering as often, stopped eating. I eat breakfast and that is it. I have tried to stay hydrated at least. I am currently working on creative projects (a web series, lots of writing), and it provides a distraction. But I have nothing to do after that. I recently met up with a childhood friend and even when we talked I felt myself feeling depressed 'why am I even here right now nothing matters' idk. I tried clinging to religion but even that does not help me. I find myself worrying about running out of time. I am 21, and just started my first year of college. I feel like a lot of people meet their soulmates when they are 18-21 and are ready to get married after a while. I do not know what I want in life. I am increasingly worried about my mom, 50 is half your life.. The thought of only having her for 20/30 years or so hurts. does not seem like enough time you know? Sometimes I would rather die than have to experience the people around me dying. Does anyone know how to cope with this? Or is anyone else dealing with this type of stuff?

"I am 24 now and maybe it was my dysfunctional family, my upbringing, my environment. I have always been shy, introverted and never really talk to people. I had good friends as a child but into high school I did not have anyone. people are fake, users, deceiving. I did not understand how relationships happened, how people date. what is this love teachers give to their students. kids going out to parties but I could not fit in, kids have friend groups and do stupid funny things, i could not have. I thought I had a friend group in college and this girl messed it all up because she had caught feelings for her exes best friend and then because he was not giving it to her, she slept with his other friend and thus the whole group split. I understand her feelings, I want to experience a relationship but this whole society seems messed up. I cannot even deal with the long distance relationships. I need something here and now in the moment. I wish I could just forget it all and just have the motivation to be the person I want to be, be good at learning languages, producing music, web design, graphic design, film editing, photography, hitting the gym, doing stocks and finance, like there are just so many things I could do for myself but I do not have the motivation at all. even in my current job I get so bored quickly reading all these white papers, I want to get out and be proactive. I have always felt like life is never the way I want it to be.",0
"I am 15f (not a native english speaker), never went to therapy and I do not have the courage to ask my parents, not bc they are bad or smth like that, but bc I do not feel like opening up about why I would want to do it. My life is pretty good, I have almost nothing to complain about. But this year I have been feeling super stressed about school and entrance exams, I just hate studying but I do it bc I have to (my grades are very good but I still feel guilty for not wanting to go to college only to study more and work after). I do not have a career I want to follow and it worries me (like what the hell am I going to do?). I have been having existencial crisis regularly, and it tightens my chest everytime I think about how I dislike life in itself and the whole pain of being alive.I do not do the things I liked before, I cannot find motivation do to anything anymore. I pass my days on my phone, sometimes studying or chatting with my parents. it is kind of boring. I do not feel sad all the time, but I feel empty. I laugh and I can be happy about good things that happen to me, but modt times I am just existing. When I think about my future I am not hopeful, I do not want to study or work. I want to be nothing, I often think it would be better if I did not exist and that I do not have many motives to continue living (tho I do not plan on self harming). I am on vacation from school but I am sleeping very late (2am/3am) and I feel guilty about that too, I wish I could be motivated to wake up and be productive.I feel like a failure these days. I am not as cool and funny as before, I am not as smart as before. And I am too dependant on my parents, I cannot cook or do a complete housecleaning for example. I do not know how to live independently, I will be an adult in 2 years but I cannot do anything by myself (my parents also said that to me). I am living my life on autopilot, I need people telling me what to do. I feel like I am lazy, sometimes I do not eat bc making like simple sandwich seems too much work.I am crying even more recently bc idk what to do. My mind is a confusing mix of ""you are depressed"" and ""stop wanting to have a mental illness just bc you think it is cool"". I feel like a bad sister bc I am too rude to my little sister, I do not show much affection towards her and I do not play with her that much (I feel so guilty about it but I cannot help it, when I see I already did all these things). And a bad daughter bc I do not help my mother at chores as much as she needs. I am so tired of living with regrets, I regret that I was not a bettet person every single day. I cannot seem to change myself.Sorry about my rant, I hope I can find good advice here. You can ask me anything if you need more info. Am I depressed?",0
"I used to be able to sleep fine when it was not as bad but now its like I am suddenly constantly awake every night staring at my ceiling because the all the depression and stress make it impossible to sleep, I cannot even do anything to pass the time because everything is so boring and bland and flavourless to me and I cannot text anyone because I have no friends, the only way I can get a little bit of sleep is if I take strong sleeping pills which basically just feel like I am being drugged to sleep. I dread the mornings but I dread having to sit up all night even more. I cannot even sleep anymore",1
"I have had depression for around 9 months and I am tired of dealing with it, will this ever go away without meds, I have heard how bad anti depressants are. I do not think I can handle going through my whole life being depressed Is there any way of getting rid of depression",0
"i should preface this by stating that I am going into my senior year of high school for context.after an incredibly long job hunt (7 months), I have finally gotten a job. which, do not get me wrong, is great. unemployed, i felt so burdensome and unproductive. most of all, i felt guilty. I have placed all my worth these past months on getting a job and my license, and now i have them. but instead of feeling accomplished or happy, i just feel empty. what now? I have reached my goal. there is nothing more for me. I have tried congratulating myself for reaching these milestones, even looking at myself in the mirror as i say it out loud. but it means nothing if i do not really mean it. for me, the reward of finally achieving something this important is to find something equally as important to replace it with. basically, there is no reward.all i can ever think about is how much i cannot wait to die. i feel real, genuine excitement for it. there is some fear surrounding dying, since its the fear of the unknown. but my yearning for it greatly out weighs any anxiety. its not necessarily that i want to die as a direct result of my depression. my medication has actually greatly improved my mood over the past year and a half. but it just feels like playing a game in which you get virtually no reward for completing long and arduous tasks. i do not want to play that game anymore.I am always so, so tired. I just want to sleep and not have to think about anything. please do not be concerned. I am not going to kill myself anytime soon. i will know the time that i am truly considering killing myself since I have experienced it before, and this is not the time. i promise if i do, i will seek help early before i try anything. i just wanted to vent. I have achieved my goal and now i have no ambitions.",0
"I am going to put this here since I got no one else to tell. The past 2 months my mental health has completely crumbled. My friends did not reach out to me, I always had to reach out to them. It was just really obvious these past 2 months that they do not care, never did they reach out and even ask if I was okay. Just nothing. The fact that I am a lonely loser just amplified itself these past 2 months.I always thought that reaching out to a friend that you think is having a bad day was normal. My friends all knew I have depression and yet not one message of comfort was sent to me. Friends were always important to me my whole life but now that I am experiencing life after school, everything just feels so hopeless. I am stuck with depression and it feels like no matter what I do, I cannot just get rid of it. My friends always said to improve myself and whatnot, if it was that simple then I would not be this depressed and suicidal.I just felt so lonely these past 2 months. After I reached out one last time to one of my friends, he said the reason they do not reach out and check up on me is that ""we are adults now"". After he said I should just toughen up. Those words have been stuck in my head the past week. I do not know what is right or wrong anymore but what I do know is that I want to move on, I simply do not want to live anymore.Just then I removed them all from my social medias and friends lists. The amount of pain I went through my life just outweighs any good that happened. I never had a girlfriend at all and the fear of being lonely forever is eating away at me. Seeing that those friends do not care enough just made me more and more depressed by the day. Being told to toughen up is just bullshit. All these bullshit excuses and words they tell me, I just had enough of.I just hate everything, I cared so much for my friends and the care just was not returned. Anyways guys, I am probably not going to post again and honestly I feel extremely suicidal right now so this might be my last post on Reddit. Sick of it all",0
"I do not want to do anything last time it is already lasts for like 2 weeks, I do not know why, even if I am feel good it does not help, anyone knows what to to with it? I am started to feeling unmotivated and bored",0
"Suicidal thoughts are nothing new to me. However, i usually am able to commit to safety and calm myself down or seek help. but within this past week, I have been in a depressive episode and they have gotten so much worse. id like to admit myself but i do not know what the bills would look like and i do not want to lose the job i just started. its getting so much worse with each day. i asked my husband to hide our sharp objects and he did. usually i would not think about them if they are out of sight but i keep looking for them and all i want to do is harm myself and pass out. i need help but i do not know what i need. I am in therapy but it just feels like my emotions are being minimized and I am having to relive and think about past things. i would never tell him but my husband is the main thing keeping me alive right now. i just want to feel okay and joyful again. i just want the emotional pain to stop. I am really just seeking support right now. i need to know that there are people who want me here. i need empathy. i feel bad for asking those close to me to empathize with me. I am always afraid that I am draining them or hurting them. help please Advice/Comfort?",1
"death is really the only truly permanent thing we have. every time I am happy, i know that ill just go back to being sad. that is my default stateevery time i think of anything else, ill inevitably think about my trauma againdeath solves both of those things. i know that nothing awaits me when i die. i cannot think anymore. my trauma cannot haunt me. i will not ever feel happiness, but more importantly, ill never feel sadness. ill never have to feel like i need to starve myself to be pretty again. ill never have to worry again about fucking up my life even worse. its comforting knowing that I am going to end all of that. for the first time, ill have peace every decision i make is wrong and every feeling of joy is fleeting",1
So today my mom told me that the family wants me out of the house because of my aggression towards people. I was pretty much made go on anti depressants if i wanted to live with them but I hated myself on them also. The final straw was when my mom and me got into an argument and she told me how my behaviour is embrassing and how i use aggression to cope with my situations is shameful and i told her to just fuck off. I tried going to counselling before and it did not work. I just do not know what to do anymore I think I have officially hit Rock bottem,0
"I am 23 male from Iran. I have had a crazy life like mom diying in car accident when I was 4. Abusive psycho dad. Being raised by my narcissist strict grandparents. I have had no life. None. No rights no hobby no freetime no social interaction. Was just forced to study 24/7 to become a doctor. My grandparents would not even let me to groom my hair properly or wear perfumes because that would attract girls! I had never met or talked to a girl for my intire life till I was in university and that obviously turned out terrible. I have so many personality issues and find it hard to properly socialize with anyone. I got into med school in another city expecting to finally start living a normal life and having my basic rights. All those promises my family had made that they would finally let me be free or the things they are going to get me if I get into med school but suddenly my rich narc family stopped paying for my basic needs like even enough to buy proper food! Or to pay for my taxi! Let alone hanging out with friends or getting a girlfriend. They said money will spoil you! You will get busy with girls and not finish your studies!! I wanted to take my driving license and they replied the same :) I tolerated that hellish situation for 4 months but after that quit. It was not that easy they still argue/fight with me to this day. 2 years have gone by and I am stuck in my room with nothing much to do but making the days pass 24/7 on my phone or watching movies. I soon realized being a garbage collector/construction worker in a free country free of Islam and theocracy is better than being a doctor or even specialist in this hellhole of Iran. I realized through the online friends I made that I am not the problem. The Islamic system is. I could easily connect with people and even girls not only romantically but on a human level and make true connection but here the restrictions and rules have made our girls kind of weird and too hard to catch. Like until 2 or 3 years ago being caught just walking with your girlfriend on the street would have ended up with 100 lashes and execution in the 4th trial. Iran is like a big cemetary. we are not allowed to sing/dance or date. it is like happiness is forbidden. walking on the streets is like there is dust of death everywhere. So depressing and things are getting even worse like drought!! And our currency devaluing day by day. Right now the value of one USD equals 25 Toman. My dad is a selfish piece of shit that lives in another country but I do not count him as dad and do not want to have to do anything with him. My grandma finally gave me 10k for a language course abroad in Europe but I need atleast 15k for my whole application and visa process. Idk what to do with 10k. My alternative plan is to make it to Turkey, get a cheap boat and sail to Greece with the hope of getting sunked midway. I hate my life",1
Probably not the kind of thing older people experience but suddenly one of my parents is not living with us anymore. Like wtf is going on lol. Feel like my life has been thrown into free fall. Anyone got any advice for this shit? I am in my early 20s and my parents are separating. Any advice?,0

"Decided to change the date to whenever I buy enough sleeping pills and alcohol, fuck family fuck life fuck everything. At least I will be dead soon no longer guilty about how my family will be as fuck them I am not staying alive just from guilt. Fuck everyone Last post ever",1
I hate myself. I hate existing. The one thing stopping me from is my friend but I cannot go on for any longer. I fuck everything up. Everything is my fault. I cannot even explain how I feel correctly. I cannot go to a fucking doctor becuase they are going to think I am just blowing shit out of proportion. If I hear that shit one more time its over. And the worst of it all is I cannot fucking cry. My dad permanently scarred me to the point when I want to cry I fucking smile instead. I hate just fucking existing. I am always told it could be worse but I am just fucking sick of it. I cannot fucking do it anymore,1
What are people doing without kids in their 30s? I am so bored. I have no interest in anything. I cannot make friends (moved to a new state in 17 and moved cities just before lockdown). Even if I knew people I do not know that I would want to be around them. I used to work a lot but I do not do that anymore. I have too many hours and a ton of apathy. I try to stay positive for my husband who feels the same but it is hard to keep on a good face. It all feels so pointless. What is there?,0
"At least, that is what my stepdad says about me I am ugly, I am mentally unwell, I am fat, I am awkward, I am a pussy, I do not stand a chance in the real world",1
"Recently, my emotions have numbed to the point where happiness, sadness, anger, despair, anxiety etc. Are rare occurrences. It feels as though my emotions are gone, I do not know if I even have the ability to cry anymore.something is wrong with me, but what it could be is a mystery. Emotions are not felt very often by me anymore. I just want to feel something, anything. I am going crazy, I swear. Why cannot I feel anything?",0
i just want to die...I should be happy but i just want to die. It should all end. i just want to die,1
"I am going to start from the beginning of the year and work backwards. so 2021 has been nothing but a continuous ball of shit for a few reasons. broke up with my bf, had to quit my job because of a rage incident, got on meds, got off meds, was hospitalized, got pretty suicidal, cut people off.. nothing but a whirlwind of self harm. its funny because the majority of my depression is not caused by anyone or anything, but my failure for self love and self care and denial in self worth. here is the tragedy.. I grew up with a very happy childhood/teenagehood . loving parents, a loving family what most people would kill to have in this world. but because of my self hatred, I wanted to prove myself to them and to my friends that I was not the cheery innocent kid I once was. so what did I do? I try to be asshole by cutting them off. being mean, blocking them, getting angry at them for no reason etc. To prove to them of a false sense of power that I lack within myself. But the worst part of it all becoming addicted to that mean streak against people. Which has led to irritability.. and now.. addiction to pain. Anyway, that is like 5% of the whole story. I have practiced self destructive behavior pretty much my whole life. Not tapping into myself when I should.. letting life takeover before my eyes. Nothing but a overwhelming subconscious laziness. Like living in a giant daydream. but it did not really matter up until I was about 23-24. why? because my parents did everything for me. gave me a car, gave me money every day, filled up my gas tank every week, filled my lunch box up until senior in high school. so part of me constantly living in la la land was the luxury of literally everything being done for me. and now here I am finally trying to take a stab at life at 25 and I cannot even find my way out of a m****f*** paper bag. I cannot follow through with my decisions for the life of me, my goals do not hold value, etc its a vicious cycle that never ends. and now I have anxiety that time is running out by getting serious about my life at 25-26. The rather be dead thoughts chase me 24/7/365. And I cannot escape myself no more. but I do not blame my parents fully. of course I take responsibility for continuing to practice that day dream life style. but at the end of the day its no ones fault. I do not like to look at it that way. what is done is done and I am in the present and that is all that matters. and now I have to undo my wrongs. my bf broke up with me two weeks ago for my impending suicidal ideations, and inflicted pain I caused him and his best friends. my threatening to shoot myself etc. It took a hold of our relationship so much that he was afraid to drive in my car because he thought id kill us. he was scared. and I cannot barely live with the fact that I scared someone that I loved so dearly. And it will haunt me to the day I die. because I am not that type of person and I always have good intentions deep down in life. So I was hospitalized because he wanted me to get help and I wanted to better myself. But it did nothing besides give me a new pill which did make me feel better ill admit. But I recently quit therapy and the pills because why? because I decided I do not want to live my life by not being able to help myself. I have the what kills you makes you stronger mentality. do I think I am crazy and does my parents think I am crazy for stopping treatment? yes. am I doing me harm by doing this? yes. am I digging myself a deeper whole by doing this? yes. but some odd reason I think its necaaary because I am tired of my 10years of therapy and going on and off of meds. so I am currently seeking more natural and less expensive treatment to better myself. one of the last things is.. I cannot hold a job. look, I am an artist/influencer that is trying to make it in the music industry. I have been in music since 8 years old and know its my calling. however, I cannot do the bullshit get-by jobs anymore. I am 26 now and want to do what I am made to do. not folding burritos at a damn chipotle, not slave work making box walls at UPS, and not parking peoples cars for them just so they can throw a $1 at my face. I think I have been through about 12-13 jobs since I was 16. and I am sooooooooooooooo sick to my stomach over it. it lowers my self worth and confidence and I am exhausted. I am jobless right now because I broke down at chipotle in front of a room full of customers glaring me and my coworkers too for basically cursing out the store and having a psychotic breakdown that could have easily be resolved by taking my complaint civilly in the managers office one to one. but no, it was the last straw. but what was it really? it was just a cry for help from within. this was right before my bf found out and wanted me to get help and before i got on meds. and none of it was to make the workers feel bad, or to be an asshole.. no. absolutely not. I also have a lot of self esteem issues so whenever I feel the heat boiling.. I let it go because I am passive aggressive generally and the only way I can hve a voice is by letting it come out through anger (horrible I know). just more self destructive behavior that I practice. but at the end of the day man I am finished with exhausting myself of this illness. I want to be dead. I do not want to be alive. I rather be dead than causing this pain amongst myself every damn day and trying to fix it. its too much. just too much. and a pysch ward do not do shit. I was there. I am so lost in this life. if there is anyone out there who struggles with self inflicted pain or feels behind in their lives or is addicted to feeling pain or have lost all self pride.. please respond below. id appreciate it. thanks for reading for anyone who cares to read",0
"I got permabanned from the one place I always knew I could go to for support from other people like me. Idk what to do. I have absolutely no reason to feel the way I do yet I still want to fucking kill myself everyday and now I feel like I have nowhere to go. I do not even know what I did wrong I always read the rules of any subreddit before posting anything. I just want to be part of a community that understands how I feel bc no one in my life gets it. They all tell me you are doing so well why are you so upset all the time and I wish I had a fucking answer but I fucking do not and I am so tired of living this way. I have been in and out of hospitals my whole life and I finally found a support group I could count on and that understood me and now its gone. I just bought a nice car a few weeks ago. Its fast too. going to go for one last drive to my favorite spot out in the country hills, bringing my knives with me I am so done with all of this I am done",1

"So I had an okay day today. But of course that did not last when does it ever? I got in a fight with my mom as usual. Every time we fight I feel a little of myself die inside. Now there is basically nothing left of me. I noticed since I have become suicidal that I think about life a lot. Like not just what I want to do, and how I want to live (that is if I do not off myself first lol) but like in a bigger sense like why are we humans here? What is the point of us existing. Basically I have become very existential. So as I think of life as a whole everything really seems empty and pointless. Like even if I lived my idea of a perfect life I think Id still feel empty inside because what is the point of anything really?I feel like this is not something you can even tell someone in real life because they will think you are suicidal. Which I am I know but when I become existential and think of mankind as a whole and all that I am not suicidal. Like its a different feeling then when I want to die because my life sucks and when I am existential I just do not want to exist on this plane of existence because like what is the point. Do you get what I am saying!?Anyway I feel like this is not something humans are supposed to think about. Like if you say you do not want to exist because what is the point people will tell you your suicidal and that is wrong to want to die. But why should not I want to not kill myself? Why if I see how meaningless and small life is and do not want to be involved in it its wrong and I am supposed to seek help. Then after I get help and get fixed and do not want to not exist anymore I am back in the endless cycle of pointless life. Like what is so wrong if wanting to opt out of this world?Anyway I hope this makes sense I am tried its late my souls broken and battered. I just really needed to vent. Just a little rambling",0
I have (F16) questioning this for awhile after my most recent productive period. i realized that maybe around a month ago i felt that i genuinely and i mean it nearly cured my social anxiety and was on the brink of recovering from my depression. this period of happiness lasted like at least a week for sure and more. i was soo productive i ran everyday in which i never do and i was even artistic and made a full drawing that i framed later. i felt so good and like i was not going to feel the loneliness of depression but this time sadly ended. i do not know why and i realized that I have felt this way before. prior i had another time period where i was super creative and decorative i decorated a full wall on my room and took time to make this spirited away painting. i was just so artistic but for some reason after i fell into this hole of anger and slept so much and rarely got out of bed. i even ended up destroying and cutting that painting i spent hours on and i broke things in my room.i do not know why i got like that but that sense of irritation/irritability followed me after my most recent high of my depression.i do not know if i should bring this up to my pediatrician or not. i also currently take wellbutrin XL 300mg which worked at first but I have been on it for so long its hard to distinguish if it works well still. questioning if my MDD is actually bipolar disorder,0

"Not necessarily in this community, although I have seen it here before, but just in general. Someone will post in or speak about how they overcame their suicidal urges and their depression in groups of people who are all depressed and suicidal; take all the congratulations and ""I am proud of you""'s but never explain how the achieved it or give advice or even RESPOND to people asking them how they did it.Now I know nobody is entitled to anyones story, but when you dangle it in front of people who could reall use its faces, it just feels so cruel yknow? Like someone from a poor neighborhood returning to their home rich and successful and they never tell their old friends and fanily or even just people in the neighborhood who NEED it how they did it. They just stand around in the neighborhood to be admired and praised and when someone asks them how they got to that point they either ignore them or give them that same half assed vauge ""it gets better"" answer. Its good that you overcame your illness. Its good that you decided to not kill yourself or your attempt failed and you decided to live and work on getting better. Congratulations. But PLEASE if you are going to share give us SOMETHING to look forward to. Even if its specific just give us ANYTHING. do not gloat to people in your old situation about how much better you are doing and keep the methods you used a secret. Meds? Love? Therapy? Religion? A fucking hobby??? Give us something to use.One of the few things that pushes me closer to ending it is being so *close* to getting advice, real advice from someone who actually understands, on how I can save myself; and then having that information withheld. And again, I am not entitled to anyones story and nobody is obligated to tell strangers on the internet about their very personal battle; but shit if you are going to brag about how you became happy to a bunch of depressed people at least tell us how. Why do people never want to share their success stories?",1
"I know nobody's really going to see this let alone respond to it. But, I have not been feeling myself since February. Before that I was happy... At least, more than I am now and I kept hoping that I would get better. I kind of knew though that I could never go back to how I used to be since this all started. Today has been a reminder of that. I was physically okay. I am adequately functioning and taking care of myself, but I just feel so tired. This entire week I have been feeling nothing but fatigue and today it was just so much harder to power through. I am frustrated. I am angry. At everyone even though I know it is not their fault at all. Not necessarily. As I said before, I blocked my friends on social media and, to say the least, I did not miss them at all. I had to almost force myself to at least give them an explanation. I am tired of my family...my mother keeps commenting on how skinny I look, she forces me to eat when I eat anyways. I always eat I just choose to eat healthily. I make sure I get the right amount of nutrients/fibers/vitamins from the food I am eating. I know how to manage myself. I do not need to be babysat like a two-year-old. I am sick of trying not to be disrespectful or rude to avoid conflict. I am sick of taking criticism from other people. I am also very sick of lying to people to keep the peace. I just want to be left alone. it is better for me to be alone, if not, I can end up destroying a lot of other people because I am irritable, sad, and angry all at the same time all the time. Sometimes I think this is sort of a domino effect thing caused by my father's death or it is my period. But either way, this feels very real and I just want to be left alone...I was thinking last night that maybe my fate is not to become this great doctor, or successful child that goes to college and does all this grown up stuff...maybe I am just supposed to be in a mental facility for the rest of my life. &amp;#x200B;If you are curious here is a diary entry I wrote in Feburary:Dear moon, I cry to you hoping that you will hear meOr at least listenIt may not matter to me much anywayBut I am becoming deeply and utterly sadMore often during the night I refuse to call myself depressed because that would be quite an inaccuracy but at the same time, I cannot think of a time that I was truly happy. My smile has become a stranger to this new meThis new me is dismal and aloofSongs that used to make me want to dance now make me want to cryVideos that are meant to be happy are interpreted to such a sadness one could not fathom to obtain To contain this state is to climb a mountain in a snowstorm Playing pretend has shifted from a childhood game to a chilling reality.All while I am confused about whether or not this will last I still know one thing for sure.That I will talk to the moon tomorrow and try again.Anyways I have to eat some nasty ass tacos bye.

"I have tried everything therapy, psychology, hypnotherapy, antipmdepressents you name it I have tried, nothing has helped. My family is a reck my brother has some unknown illness, he can literally only eat 10 things at max, my mums struggling with body image and is trying her best to help us. I wish i could tell her everything. around 2 years ago i started isolating myself from the small group of friends i had, one by one i distanced myself till no contact with them i do not even know the reason why, the thing that is destroyed me most is breaking up with this guy i was head over heels for. I gave him no reason and just blocked him i still see him out in public rarely and have a full on panic attack after. I have no friends , I am homeschooled because school have me extreme anxiety.. i really cannot do it anymore I am scared to die but i know i cannot do this for much longer. The only way out i can see is taking a bunch of antidepressants, melatonin and whatever i can find in the cupboards.. i do not want to fight anymore i cannot do it anymore",1
"I feel all the symptoms of depression, I was told that I had depression by two separate psychologists and I feel this empty void inside me. I have thought of suicide multiple times, with methods and have honestly almost went through with it many times (I had a failed attempt in the past). However, regardless of all these signs, I am trying to convince myself that I am fine by telling myself that I am attention seeking, pitying myself and dramatising sad feelings that are not that intense.

"I do not know what to do anymore. I have reached out to so many resources and I have even admitted myself to try to get the help I need.

I know I will not make it by myself, but none of the resources I have gotten have been able to genuinely help me. It feels like I am just here to feed into the mental health money hole. I do not feel like anyone takes me seriously..I keep fighting back the desire to kill myself but it always comes back. And when it does its when I have no hope for any help. I am really scared that I am going to finally do it one day.. Stuck",1
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now but nothing comes close to what I experienced the last week. I went to McDonalds to eat food and was in line to order my food when suddenly this big guy cuts in front of me. I got angry and called him out for cutting the line. The guy suddenly turned around and swung his fist right into my face. It all happened in a flash. I fell down on the floor and the man just kept hitting me over and over again until two customers and restrained him. The employees called an ambulance and the police to arrest the guy. All the while the man kept screaming and telling me how much of a piece of shit I was and that Latinos like me should go back to their own country. I was taken to the hospital: got a broken nose and a black eye. I was discharged that same day and returned home feeling like complete crap and hungry. Before falling asleep I kept blaming myself for calling out that guy and how I should have just minded my own damn business. I felt guilt, powerless and sad at the whole turn of events. Before that day I was already suffering from depressive episodes and low self-esteem issues. This whole situation just made me feel worse than ever before to the point where I once again started to have suicide thoughts. Irl I am short, fat and ugly. Nobody would want to be with someone like me and much less care about me. My family who live abroad have no idea of my situation and its probably better if they do not since I do not want to worry them. Right now, I feel no drive to do anything. I cannot feel anything else but the pain in my face and I have no real friends to talk about this whole thing. Maybe I should just end my life already instead of trying to fix something that cannot be fixed. I am an assault survivor close to giving up on life (26/M)",1
"It would be nice if someone would kill me. People kill others every minute in the world, why cannot someone just kill me... .",1
"The only things my mom can do is provide with the bare minimum which are food, shelter and etc. Other than that she is just terrible, and maybe sometimes she is nice when she is not screaming at me for nothing. I would say she is toxic because she always compares me to others including herself, she is a massive hypocrite who gets mad at me when I do the exact same thing as her, shr hit me as a child and also once when I was 12 byt that is a different story, she cursed at me as a child, she even fighted with her own mom and also with her dad for like half a year after we moved with him and even though she knows I have trouble with selfharm and that I am suicidal (because the psychiatrist had to tell her) she did not change a bit. Still yelling at me for little things and because of one of our daily fights I relapsed after I tried so hard to resist the urges. And I am writing this post right after one of our big fights where I *again* told her that she is not a good mom and that she is not self aware at all. In the end I told her that I did not want the psychiatrist to tell her because I do not trust her, I did not want to tell her that I think I have OCD because I do not trust her, I told her about my almost suicide attempt and that it was right after one of our massive fights, and after all that she says that there is still more life to live, so I am just done. I want to cut so bad right now but I do not want to use a knife again, I want to use a sharo blade but I cannot get one. She is also one of the people that thinks that a positive mindset will make everything better. Well mom, it is kind of hatd to get my grades up when I gave up on school and life. I hate my mom",1
"I never wanted to stand out, to be the center of attention, to be the leader, but I am always the least interesting person. I always struggle to know if I am a bad person and just do not see it, so I am somewhat annoying, always asking and making sure I am not bothering, or if I did anything wrong. I do not think I am a bad person, but I have nothing to be proud of. My entire life I have seen people be good at this or that, artistic skills, social skills, intelect, etc. I do not want to say it out loud, I think many know what someone want to do when they feel useless and unimportant for their entire life. I am making 23 years on october, and I have felt this way since I was 14, diagnosed with depression at 16. I have come to terms with many pains along these years, I do not see the point on self-harm anymore, I also do not want to have come to this earth just to be a reason of suffering to my parents, my father already told me he would be sad, but he would move on, so not a big encouragement... but I know my mother and 11yo sister (whom I do not live with anymore) would suffer, especially my sister, I think she would be traumatized, so... it is a big anchor to me. But I still cannot stop suffering for not being good enough to be interesting, to be liked, to be admired even, I do not want to be special, just... anything. I usually spend my free time only playing games with a story, watching series and anything media related, listening to music, I feel like my life is some kind of ""hub"" where I can only choose what game/movie/series to experience next. Also, I have read the rules, but I do not know if saying some things may be triggering to others reading, so if I wrote anything wrong, please let me know!&amp;#x200B;TL;DR: I have come to terms with many struggles that comes with depression along 9 years, but what can I do to just ignore this feeling of wanting to be dear, liked and even admired? How can I cope with the fact that I am just another random person?",0
"i have never been able to imagine what my life will be like in the future because I have always had this impending sort of doom looming over me. i have not made any actual plans/attempts but i always just assumed i would die soon. its really really hard because i would not say i want to die but also i do not not want to die. i truly never thought i would live past 17 but the years just keep coming by and i still have that feeling that i am not going to live much longer. I am on anti depressants but nothing seems to help, i really just do not know what to do. i did not think id live this long",0
"Been struggling a lot lately with my depression, the only thing that seems to make me feel anything is taking care of my girlfriend. I do stuff for her take care of her, and just help her as much as I possibly can. Is this normal or is something wrong with me? Struggling but still trying.",0
"They call me egghead and spam their comments on my YouTube channel. I want them to stop this is making me feel suicidal. I am really sensitive and emotional. Even r/YouTube thinks I am a joke.

"I saw other people were showing theirs, so I wanted to as well.If you are reading this, then I am sorry, or not, I am not really sure if I should be. Chances are I will not be alive when you read this. Which is good for me, because I will not have to deal with you asking me about it. This whole situation should not be shocking, it is been a long time coming. You know that I have been depressed and suicidal before, but I do not think you know how truly awful being alive is for me. I did my best to try and be happy, I did my best to try and distract myself. But being constantly angry, and anxious, and sad and depressed, is fucking awful. And the worst part is that everyone thinks it can be cured, or that it just goes away when they are tired of hearing about it. I have to live with this shit for the next what, 40-50 years. Yeah, no thanks, I would rather cut my losses and leave. And do not start with the,"" Oh but there is so much to live for!"" WHAT. Tell me EXACTLY what there is to live for. Getting a girlfriend? A nice house? Kids? Fuck off. The last thing I want is for more people to suffer. Suicide note",1

I hate this world, I hate my myself, I hate my looks, my brain, and my life. the world will be broken beyond repair when I become an Adult. i have no love interest, my family probably hates me, no matter how much they say otherwise, and Id be terrible at any job Id get.So I am done, see you all you can convince me not to if you would like, but I just want to talk to someone before I die. (Not promising Ill die though, I have failed before. as you can see from my posts here. This world can kiss my ass",1
"I have not thought about hurting myself or wanting to die since I was a teenager living with my abusive parents and violent brother. The place was like a hoarding house, and so as a result, I need a picked up space to keep in good mental health. I live with my partner of six years. He works from home, but his job is so slow he usually gets to talk to friends and play video games throughout the day. I work over time out of the home, I wake up early, and while I love my job, it is draining. I have an injury from living at home with my parents that they did not take me to the doctor for for three years, I have Autisim, I have depression, and I have anxiety/PTSD from just a really traumatic child hood. I like to think I am a relatively happy person, but I have just gotten to where I cannot do this relationship anymore.He does not shower regularly. He does not brush his teeth. If it gets in the way of video games, he will not do it unless I beg. He begs me to do things for him that he will not do for me because it is inconvenient. We were engaged for a few months, and I broke it off because I have been in so much distress. And then today.I stayed the night at his parents place. Came home to shower and change. Place is a pig sty. Litter box full of shit, dishes piled up, carpet covered in old food, jack off rag in the middle of the floor, desk covered in snot and food, bathroom covered in hair, the smell of trash. I lost it. I was going to clean it all up, and ai just cannot. I have lost all motivation to. He makes 70% of the mess, and I was cleaning every day to keep up with it, but I just cannot do it anymore. His family is all I have. I have got so much to loose. I cannot afford to break the lease. I cannot afford to move out by myself as I do not make enough. I do not make enough really to get a roommate and still pay all my bills outside of rent and utilities. I do not have anyone to help me move, or to support me through the grief of ending it, I have no one to fall back on if I cannot make this work. My parents have been awful since I got out, and he cannot be bothered to let me vent as things happen with them. He does not want me to go to therapy, but he also cannot be bothered to give me emotional support. I am miserable, and I do not know what else to do. I am at my apartment on what should be a fun holiday for me. He us with family playing video games. He refused to come back to the house with me to help so that my day off tomorrow is not spent scrubbing the house alone. And I want to die. I have fought so hard to leave hone, get through school, get a job, I was unemployed twice through the pandemic. Staying in a hospital would put me in debt for the rest of my life. I am so tired and I just want it to be over. My romantic relationship is draining, I have no where to go, no family, and I am just in a really low place right now.",1
"I am a living fuck up. Physically, mentally, socially, academically, socially .If someone offered me the chance to never have been born and my consciousness to not exist I would take it in a heartbeat, because I know the world would be a better place without me in it. I just wish I was never born. Thinking of doing more years of schooling then working 45 years, being old for 15 then dying makes me sick. Why do I have to live?!! I am so angry and sad all the time. Every day I wake up is filled with fear. Anxiety, anger, and sadness. I wish I could never be born and forget everything",0

"I like many other adolescents hate school/college. Except I really hate it. Like really really really hate it. The last 4 years of school for me has been a very Trumatic experience. I have tried so damn hard not to hate it, and at this point I am just like screw it you know what yeah it sucks. I hate it. So anyway I have this obsession with checking how many weeks of summer vacation I have left to make sure I still have an adequate amount of time before I have to face more trauma. The thing is I have quite a bit of time left in reality, about two months still, which when I am in my right mind I realize that I have nothing to worry about and I still have a pretty generous portion of my off time left but I get this crazy anxiety whenever I think about school or the mere thought of September and I spiraled back down into this whole of agonizing over how much time I have left. Its completely irrational, I know. Does anyone else experienced this? Extreme summer anxiety",0
"So I graduated with a degree that I did not want to pursue (medicine). I was influenced by relatives and people. I graduated feeling lost and not knowing which direction to take. I spent so much money on applications for graduate schools. I took two types of graduate entrance exams, but did not get accepted into any schools. I have to take a year gap now. My parents keep forcing me to rush. I am constantly involved in arguments with my parents. They keep telling me that "" I am a failure"", and continuously comparing me to other people. They tell me ""they wish they had other kids, not me"". They make fun of my anxiety. I am fighting a battle alone. I need help and advice! BTW, I am forced to live with my parents. I am not allowed to get my own car or be independent...etc. Need Help..Graduated with a degree that I am not passionate about. Parents think I am a failure",0

Id rather not wasted my parents money and instead spend that time getting a job, seeing a therapist, working out, really just getting better. The problem with telling them I do not want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and Id rather not lie to them. They know about my anxiety which is hard enough for me to deal with sometimes but them knowing I have depression is a whole other thing. And I know its not as bad as my brain is telling me it is but I cannot help it. I was hoping to get some advice on the matter because if I do not make up my mind soon Ill lose the opportunity to enroll in class if things do not go play out how I think they might.

"Quit from my full time, shift job due to decreasing performance.Moved out of my rented room to my parents home due to unable to afford paying rent.In debt.Constantly sleeping because I do not want to wake up and live.do not even have the motivation to do housework. cannot ask sibling to help because she is sick (after spinal surgery).Constantly in shouting fights with parents and siblings to the point that I feel like taking a knife either to kill them or kill myself.Broke up with ex-fiance because I was constantly irritated. Slammed the door and shouts at my mom in response to her nagging. Feeling hateful and desires to kill my sick sister because I am tired of taking care of her.Tried therapy, but I skipped the appointments too many times just because I do not want to get out of bed. I was born in a religious community, but I do not have faith. Sometimes I wish I just hang myself or jump off from a tall building, or even just expose myself to COVID and die. This is no offense to those who actually died from it. Watching the news of their death, I always thought, it should have been me instead of them. Just like when my late father died, it should have been me instead of them.At the very least, as useless as I am alive, I am more useful dead. If I die (but not due to suicide), through my life insurance ,my burial costs are covered, my family will get some money that can feed them a month or two Been living with this depression for almost a decade.I just do not have the energy, motivation, nor perspective to live.

"Honestly I do not know where to start. I have had anxiety since I was little, I do not necessarily have a stresser more like if I get stressed it makes my anxiety ten times stronger. It used to be barable I would draw go for a walk or distract myself. But over this past year its been pretty rough, my parents have my other sibling a to be concerned with and I can tell my parents do not understand when I tell them I am sad or anxious and that I do not have a reason to be. I did start to see a therapist in this time and she recommended I start medication, I was honestly a bit apprehensive at first since my family has always been very anti medication. But I decided to start it after having a terrible anxiety attack. Its been three days now and the anxiety medication is making me super sleepy to the point were I almost fell asleep.

I am going through a huge rough patch right now and I know it will get somewhat better eventually. But the parts of my life where I am somewhat happy are so few and far between.

"Since I was maybe 16 or 17 everyone kept asking when I am getting a job and what not. Yes I get it I am in college and I need to pay off loans nd shit. But look at it from my pov. I did not have the right equipment till now. Now that I do I have no motivation to even do what I want in life. It never ends with them. I am just trying to make myself feel better but they keep asking every fucking time we see each other. I just want a summer to myself without it. They call me lazy and it hurts. Physically yeah sure ill agree. But when I am working on projects I am 100% doing my work. No sleep, all panick, get depressed do not eat work go to class repeat. I do not ever get to just really relax and not feel like shit mentally. To everyone elses pov they think I am slacking off vegging out or being lazy. If you think I am that lazy then why am I in college constantly panicking about getting shit done. I am already having a hard year I do not need this. It just makes me want to lay in the street and wait to get crushed. I already cannot get out another loan when I am a year and a half left. I am trying to let go but everyone is making it harder on me. I try pleasing everyone else but myself. For once this summer I wanted to without feeling guilty. But yet I cannot have that either. It was going great at first when I came home but now its mid july and I feel like shit twice as much. I hate everything and just want to be left alone Just leave me alone",0
They did not even know he had cancer two weeks ago and now he only as a week at most. What the fuck? Covid fucked him up pretty bad and they thought that was all that was wrong with him for a year. Which they were constantly monitoring him to get him back to normal from Covid. How did they not find out he was in stage 4 leukemia and brain cancer during at that testing. Insurance is not covering a ton of the testing and treatment of what they thought was covid so his wife is like 100k plus in debt for the medical care even before he got admitted for cancer and I do not have the money to help. A bunch of family hate each other so I am one of the only ones to go see him. I am just so fucking sad everything sucks so bad right now. A family member of mine is dying of brain cancer and I do not know if hell be conscious for me to say goodbye by the time I get across the country to see him for the last time.,0

"This question sounds real dumb to even myself as I type this on my phone but I just cannot even tell if I am suicidal or not anymore. I remember in middle school both thinking about and feeling like I wanted to die. I managed to live past middle school and now I am just left with only the thoughts of killing myself but not the same deep desire to kill myself. I am not sure if this makes sense but: while I do not want to die, I also do not really care if I am alive. I bet I am still mildly depressed, but I am happier these days. I am going to a therapist fairly regularly. I do not think I will hurt myself, but is this how I build up my desires to die again? I feel stupid for not even knowing how I feel anymore.

I really try and be positive. I am naturally a positive person but my illness takes that away. I feel like a burden to my family. I am the one they have to baby sit. I am the one that ruins their good days. I am a drain on their happiness. I am a mess. I contribute nothing. I am just a sack of shit in my opinion. I am the 21 year old grandmother who sits in her room all day and cannot fulfil her basic needs. I feel like a baby bird who needs her food chewed. I feel like the embarrassing cousin everyone talks about. When I try to act like a normal human I become exhausted within 20 minutes and need to sleep for half the day. When I try and go outside in the garden I enjoy it but every little noise makes me jump and I am dizzy from anxiety. I was so strong before and now I am nothing. I use to travel on my own and volunteer in different countries. I have had some crazy experiences and now the thought of leaving the house terrifies me to the point of a breakdown. I have missed two doctors appointments because I cannot handle going. I shake when my mum takes me on drives to encourage me to explore. She asked me to check if she was in the lines when she was parking and when I opened the door I just started to cry. I cannot handle anything anymore. I do not like anything about myself,0

When I hear those things I usually reply ""I know, I have so many problems"" or ""I should just kill myself and make the problems go away"" or I will just curl up into a ball and cry until I think of something to do. The internal pain I get from this is so strong it feels physical, the fact that I do not know what this is and how to solve it makes the suicidal thots I am getting even worse.

"I am losing a lot of friends. Since I started therapy I realized that I am really vulnerable to be mentally abused by female friends. I always had tons of female friends and I am losing them all in the shortest amount of time. Some of them abuse me mentally and when I speak up they say fuck you and block me. I lost 10 friends like that and everytime I meet someone new it happens again. I am like a magnet to abusers. They never physically abuse me or openly mentally abuse me. Its little Chips in my mental health that they make bigger and then act like they did not knew it would happen. I am on the shorter side and learned to love myself since I started therapy. I still have my bad days and some of them told me things like ""tall men are really manly and so hot"" and I am not judging, but they know that it hurts me and then act like they did not knew. They always gaslight me to look like the dumbass that is deserved it when in reality I just want someone to talk to who does not think less of me just because i like feminine things. Even worse is that I do look stereotypically ""masculine"" so they think even less of me when I do not have that manly side to me. My best friend of 6 years who was like a soulmate broke up with her boyfriend and then told me I did not help her enough and that I am at fault that she nearly killed herself because I am a horrible human being and did not help her. She was the last person left and if I wanted to vent or cry about something she was my goto place. Before she blocked me she said she never met a bigger pussy then me and that its no wonder I am so fucking lonely. When I told her that she only gets attention from dudes because she is hot but a mental health mess I am the bad one. Its true tho. She is a mess and nobody would want to be with her because she does not want to get help. She gets attention because of her attractiveness and her body. Then she blocked me and I do not have anybody left to vent to. My therapist appointment would have been today but she is on vacation for 14 days and I have to wait for another week. She said in extreme cases I should call her but I do not want to fuck up her vacation with her boyfriend. I am losing a lot of friends",1

I have forced her to come out with me for dinner, for adventures etc she still goes back into this she will. I spoke to our parents about it and they just shrug their shoulders. Seriously what am I supposed to do I feel like its all my responsibility but nothing I do is working. Need advice for my little sister",0
"I have basically been depressed/suicidal since I was maybe 13, I have never attempted but I have made plans to kill myself at least twice, and almost did it a few times but got scared. I think at some point I will do it. I just moved in December to the US, and it has not been so bad since school is online. In the fall my college is going to be opening again, and it will be in person. Considering I have come pretty close now when my classes are online, I think I will probably end up doing in the Fall, when I actually will have anxiety and shit, plus I just fucking moved and I definitely will not make any friends here. I aggressively hate myself, and even I do not kill myself this fall, I will do it at some point in my life. What the fuck is the difference between now and fall. Between today and tomorrow. Why do not I just do it this week. Tomorrow. Tonight. I feel like me killing myself at some point is inevitable. what is the difference if I do it now or later",1
I have been depressed for a long time I do not even know what started I first self harmed at age 14 n have been clean for a year and half for a while I thought I was getting better but I am back to basically where i was I do not want to be alive anymore n n i tried to get help from the doctors they did not do much I tried talking to my family they did not believe I do not believe I have much of a future for years I have been telling myself its going to get better but it has not idk what to do I feel like one day I could finally just give up its getting bad again,1
"My life has never been perfect. I have made mistakes, I have fallen down plenty. Even at the worst of times I found some small shred of strength to continue. I kept my head down and tried my best to be optimistic for the future. After a while it suddenly seemed like things were finally looking up. I found a job in the heart of the city and I sound someone who I loved and who I thought loved me as well. Life was great for a bit. I finally began to believe in the light at the end of the tunnel. After years of crawling through a tunnel of shit, I found the light.Then it all had to come apart. Turns out this whole time, unknown to me, I was mentally ill and it was progressively getting worse. And this was a big factor in me losing everything I worked for. Now I am alone and society (along with everyone who I previously considered close) just sees me as crazy. My life as I knew it is over, and to be perfectly honest I am not at all excited for this new chapter of mental illness. There are so many limitations on my life now that I do not even see the fucking point anymore. I always valued my independence, but now I am at the mercy of doctors, therapists and medication. My family and friends see me as a loser. This is the light that I so desperately crawled towards all that time? This is what was waiting for me this whole time?? Had I known, I would have just quit there and then.I am just tired. I do not have the energy (or the brain apparently) to start over anymore. I used it all up crawling through that tunnel of shit. I miss the naive optimism I had even on the worst of days. But I am done. Absolutely done. The old me is dead anyways. The one that had his independence and could feel like a functional member of society. that is the me I wanted to live as. If he is as good as dead already, what the fuck am I sticking around for?I hate mental illness and I really feel for all my fellow brothers and sister going through it. Its a fate that even the most evil and deprived do not deserve. But I have no more tears left to she would. Not for others or for myself. I am just done. What The Hell is Life?",1
I am ready for my day when it comes I have it planned out nothing going to change it now. Wish I could say anything has helped but not a thing Cutting is everyday again,1
"Therapy for 3 years.Anitdepresantas for 1y.All that i learned that i do not want to be optimistic. I just cannot help but to consider optimism naive. I tried to be a happy person but it just felt like i am delaying the inevitable. Maybe i am depressed, maybe there is no help for me or maybe i do not want to get better. Who knows.I am just tired of trying.So i will live out my days and die.that is where we are all going anyways.English second language sry for grammar I am not depressed , I am just pessimistic.",0
I have been having a very low week. I was excited to get a coffee at a new shop. I struggle already with social anxiety and everything else so its very hard for me and I try everyday to come out of my she will. I arrived at the place and sat down while I placed my to go order on the mobile app. I got a coffee and a bagel. There was a place to leave a note for the baristas so I asked if they could include a plastic knife for the bagel. I just put with knife in my order that was it! As soon as I place it I overhear all 3 employees behind the counter laughing and making fun of the person who placed the mobile order. They start saying omg you guys this person just said WITH KniFe gehehehe they were laughing like it was the funniest thing they have ever heard. They start saying the customer is stupid and going on and on. They then say do not forget guys WITH knife customers are so stupid I get up and go directly to the counter and I say something like thank you guys so much for making my day. I heard every single word. Thank you for making fun of me. You must be so proud of yourself I stormed out. did not even get my drink or food. I am writing a complaint to the company. I know this may sound small to some but I am so sensitive and I went there because I thought it was safe. Now I feel like an absolute idiot because I asked for a to go knife with my order. I already struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. Its not okay to just make fun of strangers whether you know they are there or not. You have no idea what others are struggling with I just needed to vent. I feel so stupid now Employees made fun of me,0
I am turning 24 in a month. What I do for a job is not fulfilling and I keep struggling to not feel hopeless because of this. Its the highest paying job I can get without investing the majority of my time to stressing about work (I dread this. I think its because I do not want to be trapped) I struggle a lot with the idea of losing myself to a job that I feel is not authentic to who I am? I have not spoken to a therapist all year and I just keep putting it off but its what I really need as my moving forward step. I have learned a lot this year about myself in respect to my family - I understand them better. I am finally understanding I do not have to be so stiff when it comes to new situations. I think my mechanism to remain unaffected by anything is to move through life passively and I have been avoiding becoming personable in my workplaces previously. I need to talk to a therapist it just feels like starting a whole thing once more. Anything I perceive as stress or as potentially stressful is avoided. I guess I am just stuck and afraid Awake at 4:55am and I cannot believe how life is passing me by,0
"He texted me Your life sucksId kill myself if I were youI almost went away to a psych hold 2 weeks ago, voluntarily. He knew this. It was a big deal because I have never ever sought help previously, and he knows I have been basically bedridden with depression for years. I wish I went but I did not . I should have gone to figure out how to leave him but I did not. He acted supportive- but then he says shit like this. All the time. For 7 years, and I am only 24. it makes me want to fucking die i cannot take it anymore I have been feeling suicidal for the past 3 months after years of clinical depression. I have been with this man for nearly 7 years and have always been able to brush it off, I had abusive parents so it was normal to me. Hes said horrible things like this 100 times, but this really hurts me",1
this version is the correct one. I do not want to wait in suffering anymore and my suffering is permanent. You can gool yourselves with the bullshit you can not know what the future brings yet only experince I had was misery and loneliness and a fucked up brain. One day you will not find a person that wants to live. The world stinks and we are going down with it drowning in our shit.Bye a permanent solution that everyone will eventually experience to a permanent problem,1
"that is just how I feel. I just feel like giving up, not even trying to get better anymore, just killing and burying all of my dreams and give up on life and let anything that must happen just happen.I feel like no matter how hard I try, I will never get far, I will always be short of everything I ever longed for, and I do not know why I should try if I am sure I am going to fail. Even if I do not fail, even if I do manage to make it, I feel like nothing's going to be fixed anyway, there are things that just will not go away no matter what I achieve.So I just feel like giving up at times, feel like not studying or working anymore, or trying to keep friendships going or any of my hobbies going, just lay in bed all day long and do absolutely nothing, after all, no matter what I do nothing makes me feel better for any decent amount of time.I am sorry for feeling this way, because I know many would not want me to, surely those reading as well, but I cannot help it, and those people who once cared are not around anymore, they have abandoned me. Giving up is tempting",0

My job sucks but nowhere else to go. I want to run away and be alone but that will only add more stress if I leave home and have to pay rent and for my own life and expenses. I want to die but cannot just do that either. I am doomed to be a loser loner living with their parents forever working at a dead end job. I am a loser and will not amount to anything",0
Its just miserable and I feel exhausted and like a burden. I am tired of waiting for things to get better. I know I have a lot to be grateful for and there have been some good memories but I have had enough. there is been more despair and pain than moments of happiness. I am afraid that I am losing myself even more as I try to stay here. I am more depressed and cranky and isolated and I do not want people to know me like this. Its tiresome to keep trying to hide the amount of melancholy and desolation that I feel. what is even the point of living if I am not even really living ? I do not want to have a full life span. Id probably contribute the most to society by being dead and donating my organs.Idk why I am still waiting Living feels like a slow form of suicide,1

Finally began opening up to people but I have still had a depression nest because its been the only place I have to myself where I can self care. I know this is a problem in itself.

I come to my bedroom and she is cleared throuhhh the whole room without even telling me or acknowledge ment that she is done it. I have a long term back problem which I regularly take over the counter medications for because my doctors surgery do not believe there is anything wrong with me. she would hidden my handbag in the toom which had the painkillers in and my anti anxiety medication in. I knocked her bedroom door and asked where it was and she just told me without mentioning anything and acting as if nothing had happened.

Is it a good idea to meditate while doing light therapy also? Has anyone had success with light therapy?,0
"is not that the saying? Or at least some form of it ? Being in the middle of life ans trying to make friends or relationships seems to be my perfect hell. No matter what strategy or style I try, it fails . My life this past month has been nothing but a spiraling out of hell from my mothers cancer diagnosis to my grandmothers passing, nothing seems to work out . I get that everything happens for a reason, but why do some of us get the short stick every time ? It just make me want to give up on trying . Trying for a better love , a better life , a better outcome . I know that is not how I was raised but, something has to give .were born alone and we die alone so why keep with the waiting game and just do it now ? I know this is an empty plea, but would someone give me a reason not to ? Were born alone , we die alone",0
"i was doing very well for some time now. probably since early spring. no clue what set me off. i have not been enjoying my new job much, but that is not a new feeling (took the job in january). i woke up tired today. as the day went on, my ability to focus on work and maintain my motivation to get through the work day quickly deteriorated. by dinner, i had no plans of eating (managed a protein bar at lunch). this is not usual - normally i am hungry and, when depressed, i binge eat often. but my boyfriend decided to cook the meal i was meant to make us, so i did eat a healthy dinner. i then laid down in my made bed. i did not get up again. i have things to do around the house, but i cannot be bothered. they do not matter to me in the moment, but, at the same time, they do. i have anxiety about wasting time just laying here. but i cannot find a good reason to actually get up. about an hour ago, i started crying. i feel heavy and like there is low-grade electricity in my skin. i am uncomfortable. i have no idea why i feel sad.but i do know that my boyfriend otherwise ignoring me all night after dinner did not help. sure, he made the food (though he also had to eat), but then he never checked on me. he got mad that i asked him (for what was probably the millionth time in the last 6 years) not to touch my stomach when he came in to say goodnight just before he went to bed. i do not like my stomach touched and i have been explicitly clear about this to him relentlessly; he just does not care about my boundaries. because i called him out via asking him once again not to do the thing he was doing, he curtly said goodnight and left without giving me a kiss as he usually would have done. that was my punishment, i guess. he very often withholds various forms of affection and this is usual behavior for him. so, i am not surprised. and i was not surprised he never checked on me because he is also very selfish and self-centered (likely a narcissist). but i am not here to talk about him and his many problems or how these impact me. while his behavior and the way he treats me has done absolutely nothing to improve my overall mental health, i was depressed long before him and I am sure i will be long after. i was not expecting him to help today or do anything really, but brought it up because i wanted to mention still that i am nevertheless feeling disappointed that the person i care about did not give me the care that i have in the past and would have given him if our positions were reversed today. i knew he would not, but it still sucks that he did not. either way, i was already sad and do not know why. this just did not help the situation.background: depression has been a problem for most of life over the last 20 years on and off. in min my mid-30s now. its better and then its not. i can go long stretches of almost months and be completely fine; feeling cured.and then something will set me off again into a downward spiral. usually quite slowly, so i do not see it coming. but I am getting better at identifying when the symptoms are starting to onset and i can start to employ my various countermeasures. but sometimes, often really, it is tough to identify what triggers it to come back. when my depression is bad, i am insatiably hungry, tired, unfocused, unmotivated, sad (crying on and off), experience loss of interest in friends/hobbies/fun, have loss of sex drive, and i cannot sleep. this is sometimes accompanied by anxiety attacks and a one-time panic attack. anxiety is new to the party in the last 2-3 years. and its not nearly as much of an issue, but its there at times. sometimes with the depression and sometimes on its own. fortunately, i am able to force myself to work so that it has never really impacted my career. but i cannot do much else when in a depressive episode. which can last for days to months (though its been awhile since its been more than a few weeks). i live with my boyfriend, whom i love despite his narcissism (he is not all bad, i swear. he just has a lot of his own problems and has no problem putting himself first and/or being selfish). hes almost 40 and we have lived together almost 6 years and it is manageable for now as i cannot afford any other option anyway. he might not be helping my depression but he is not purposely making it worse. and that is a lot better than the last several guys. my US employer-supplied health insurance does not cover therapy and i cannot afford therapy out-of-pocket (i have researched this extensively). lethargic, low-grade anxiety, sad for no reason.",0

"I moved to his country a year ago after I finished my education (Msc in computer science). it is really on the countryside and it turned out that there is zero need for my skill set. Nobody here cares about software, they do not know what they should put me to and everyone tells me to ""just work with something else"". After applying for jobs and being in a foreign country for eight months hearing about how I should work with something else than software; the depression hit like a hammer. I have take a software job now in my home country and I am going to move back in two months. But right now those two months feel like....... Never ending. I love my bf deeply but I honestly do not know what I am saying anymore. I just want to get away. I want to be alone so I do not hurt him more. I just say something. I say ""sorry"" even I do not truly mean it because I know that is what I am supposed to say. I say ""I do not care about your mother or your family"" and ""I do not care about how you feel"". it is completely fucked up. I am shocked about myself saying these words when I think back. Everyday I am angry at him, everyday something is wrong, everyday is negativity. Yet, he is just loving and caring. I just do not feel anything. Everything is numb. I cry all the time. His family is here at the moment and everyone can clearly see I am fucked up. Next week we are travelling to see my family and it is going to be the same: ""What happened to her?""How do I survive those two months? I feel like the light is when I start to work and move back in two months. But how do I show affection to him? How do I keep this relationship going? I love him. I just hate this place. he is willing to move later on, he just cannot now. I [F29] treat my bf [M29] like shit because of my depression",0

"I see an overarching theme here where people are deciding whether or not they want to stay or go. They often decide they want to go, but yet cannot bring themselves to do it. I also observe that many here are young, so I wanted to add another perspective. everyone is situation is different, and I am not here to recommend anything, but I can tell you, when it comes to living with depression, it does not get better with time. Depression is a very selfish and self-centered disorder. We obsess over ourselves, how we have affected others, and how we feel. We also obsess over how the people we leave behind would feel with us being gone. We consider those who we have hurt in life, but we fail to consider this: the countless others we are going to hurt. When I think of all of the pain I could have spared people, it becomes overwhelming. The marriages I ruined, the relationships, the children I brought into the world. You think its painful to disappoint your parents? Failing your children is a pain 100 times worse. Exposing those who love you--whom you are supposed to protect--to the addiction, abuse, the emotional absence, and all of the other awful things that come along with depression is horrible. Then, you find yourself in a place where you cannot leave, because you are a provider and you cannot devastate your children. Its like being in one of those movies where going to hell is being damned to live the same day over and over. And all you have to look forward to is growing old, the loss of family members, the decline of your health, financial struggles, and career failures. Yeah, things could get better. But if you are wired as badly as we are, this is highly unlikely. Not only will things get worse for you, but you will ruin the lives of people you have yet to meet, some of whom have not yet been born. Consider all of this as you decide whether you want to stay or go. Maybe it will get better--probably it will not",0
"I just feel so bad all the time. I cannot do anything and it pisses everyone off. I can hardly leave my house because I am so terrified of interacting with other people. Every time I get frustrated or see bad or upsetting news, even if it is not my own, I lose control and literally beat myself in the head and legs.I am in therapy but it does not feel like it is helping. They want to refer me to psychological testing since they are not really sure what is going on with me. They think it might be avoidant personality disorder but I need to see someone else to make sure.I am so terrible with people and being around them feels so bad but I want to be friendly and friends with people but I have no idea how that works. It is like I am missing some social gene that everyone else has, but without being autistic.I have tried the self help shit too but it basically amounts to ""do not worry and be confident!"" and I am like ""thanks I am cured???"" well shit guess I am going to be a fucked up hermit forever.I am just so tired of feeling alone all the time and not being able to leave the house except to go to work, and I can hardly even do that now.Sometimes I fantasize about walking into the middle of a busy intersection and just blowing my head off in front of everyone waiting just so everyone can see what happens to people like me. I do not want to die yet but if I were to lose everything I can see things turning out like this.

I do not take the advice she gives me and going there I just wait for it to be over. It makes me feel sad when she makes me think about my emotions. I am too tired to go (not because lack of sleeping, I have just had this weird issue of being too tired emotionally and not really able to do shit because of that, do not know why) and it is starting to feel useless to go because I keep most of the things inside of me and overthink. It would be so much easier to just stay at home and act happy. No one understands anyways. I cannot find a way to tell her I do not want to go anymore and at this point I feel like help is useless. It will not help anyways and I am not going to have any dreams for the future because I do not want to stay. I just want to have my last night of sleep, last meal and last gaming session. And then end it all. That would be a thousand times easier and end the pain. I do not really mind dying because I have no dreams and I am just living my boring NPC life.

It is a cruel and unjust bishop that shall condemn me to a purgatory of an unpayable debt I shall never reimburse. I shall not yield, I shall be my own executioner. However, I will fight, kick and scream. I will writhe like a woman in labour. Until this fateful day shall I meet this hooded apparition? Will he embrace me as kin, or shall I be burned in a pit of unending torment? I am the last soldier on the precipice of hope. I shall defend the unending hoard. I shall clad myself with the armour of a steely stubborn will, Greaves to protect my falling ambition into a chasm of inhibition, and I shall wear a pair of form-fitted yet Gaped Gauntlets to wield my blade of desperation. I will fight until my inevitable damnation. I am endowed with eternal hate, this I know...is my fate. A pessimist is just a disappointed optimist (vent poem)",0
"So, I am a few months shy of 21, I have been struggling with depression since I was 14 and, right now, my life has gone through some drastic changes that have affected my mental health. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in medicine (I used to be a nursing student, now I am seeking medical school) and that, associated with quarantine, made me spend a lot of time home.Because of this, I have been dealing with constant homophobia by my family, especially my father and brother and more unrequested comments about everything I do. This has led my down a darker path, I have stopped studying, running (I was a marathonist), gained 20kg from anxiety eating, and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to self-harming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st, even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help, I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions (yayyy) but I am a bit scared to go there since I, during psych rotations in nursing school, I dealt with some pretty scary situations. I would love some insight about what it is like in there and here your thought about itThanks in advance, have a wonderful day Has anyone here ever been to a psych ward? If so, what is it like?",0
"I need help. I need a lot of help. A lot of financial help too. Thing is, the financial stuff, it is temporary. I know I will be fine the end of August/beginning of September. I do not think I can hold out that long though. So I am saying my goodbyes. I wish it did not have to end this way, over money. But I have tried everything. I sold everything. I do not have anything left to sell. I do not even have food to eat. I tried loans, credit is trash because of ex/identity theft. I do not have anyone to ask for help. Well, I thought I did, but they were just like, wow that is rough. Cool.. I only helped you when you needed it but that is fine. Here we are. Reddit gets a lot of hate but it is helped me. I enjoyed it. I am sorry it ends this way. I have been saying goodbye to people",0
"I have thought about posting here before and did not because i got better but now I am back to actually make a post i guessI know i should be grateful for everything i have and id like to think that i am but every time i think about the near future, just a few months even, i cannot handle the thought of living through it. I have never wanted to live to be this old and i cannot handle it. I do not know what to do with my life and I have stopped bothering with trying to decide. I cannot even bring myself to care or put effort into it. It feels so certain that however I am going to die, it will be by my own hands. Even if its ten years in the future or ten days. I work at a school so i have not been working during the summer and its given me too much alone time to think. Everyone i know is moving on with their lives while i refuse to grow up and do something with my life. I have things I am passionate about but the past month I have lost all interest and motivation. I try to think of stuff to stay alive for, like taking care of pets or waiting for a game, but even those are not enough. I just do not care anymore. I know if i died everyone i know would be hurt but it does not seem to matter to me anymore. I hate that i do not care but i get so tired that i just let it remain like this. I think I am just lazy and do not want to put any effort into living. I really must be selfish if that is the case. I do not really know why I am posting this either. i know there is not a good way of helping me feel better. there is lots of other people here who need help too. I thought id get better this year but i broke my clean streak after a good six months and all i want to do is keep doing it. I cannot see myself living to see myself turn 20 this year and i do not think i want to either i cannot bring myself to care",1
do not have any money for anything. I can barely afford school supplies. This is horrible. Lost someone that I feel looks like me. I do not know how to feel. My sister says we should just have him cremated but I just want to have a chance to say goodbye. Dad pass away,0
"Did any of you used to be really into things like hobbies but just stopped because you knew you would be dead in the somewhat near future and putting effort into learning things and growing as an individual would just be pointless? Like you are putting all of this effort in and will never see the end result of a polished skill that takes years to produce?For me it started around 19 (I am 25 now). I used to be really into learning the piano, reading books on history, psychology, investing, nonfic and so on, working towards being a physically healthy person, and overall just trying to develop/fix myself. I think this was when I got into self-help stuff and gained a lot of hope for the future at that time.Since about 23 I have just started to stagnate heavily. I stopped doing the things that were making me a better person. My mind just tells me I am wasting my time and that what I am doing is pointless. I will never be a whole human being and I will never live a good or even normal life. Why even try to grow? I am just going to fall all the way back down to rock bottom like I have time and time again. When did you stop growing?",0
"My depression is getting worse and I am feeling hopeless, lost, and down all the time, and my family thinks I just want attention. It used to be only a few nights now it almost every night and day. I do not hang out with my friends any more and when I do I am forcing myself to have fun and laugh. I really need someone, whenever I cry for help no one helps me. A cry for help not attention.",0
"Not sure, it will probably pass but I have been dealing with depression for years, went through periods of medicating but I have been off medication for 5-6 years now. I know they are all kind of different but I tried a few and it was not really for me (not saying I will not try again) I have gone from someone who does not shower/look after themselves in any way to someone who is in their 3rd year of uni and nearly has a skincare routine (nearly). I know it is good, but I feel like no matter how much water I drink, how well I do in class, how often I brush my teeth, I cannot help crashing and burning every couple of weeks with everything turning to absolute shit. All it takes is a tiny thing and I feel fucked, I do not want to do anything. I feel like the universe is against me, like I am really trying soo hard and things are going wrong that are just stupid. Like random shit, I feel like for every step up I take, life's trying to push me back down and I just feel really tired and like, what is the point. I know the point is to keep going and better myself and learn to manage my emotions better and all that, go back to therapy, consider medication, but I really just feel like shit and that it is not going to change anything sometimes. Has anyone struggled much with diagnosis? I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression in my teens (I am 24 now, female) and I was kind of wondering, almost hoping that my diagnosis was wrong so I could start on a path that would actually get me somewhere. Maybe it is just like a pipe dream but has anyone here tried to deal with their depression for years before finding out it was something else? Or a combination? (Autism, ADHD, OCD, PTSD) I just want to be the best I can be and fit in and contribute but then I do not want to get out of bed at all. I hit the side of my head on the bathroom basin this morning (accidentally, it was so stupid do not ask) and I cried for like half an hour because it reminded me of when my ex would hit me (stupid I know, it is just a basin with no feelings or maliciousness) and now I do not want to do anything but cry hahaha, I keep losing my keys! I have a spot for them now, but it is just a little thing and I just feel absolutely incompetent and useless hahah, I keep setting up these little contingencies to help me accomplish things and keep my shit together but its not working very well idk hahaha rant over sorry I have been doing good on paper but I feel like the more I try the more shit goes wrong. I know it is probably my perception but I am trying so hard and I know I am being a better person but everything is just getting worse.",0
"I opened up to my friend and talked to my therapist.They both asked me what kind of thing i needed for them to help. They asked me if i just needed someone to listen, to give advice, to distract, etc... And honestly i had no idea what to say. Idk what i need or want.If someone asked you what you needed, what did you say or what did someone do that you did not expect but found helpful? When you open up to someone about your depression, what do you want them to do to help you?",0
"Now I get to spend all my fucking time with my abusive parents and never get no chill nor sleep because of them. they will think of anything that Ill hate and make me do it all day every day.Yesterday was literally the one and only best day of my life because I got to celebrate my birthday (which was originally on Monday) with my closest friends. We smoked some weed, listened to music, chilled and even freestyled for hours on end. It was the best day of my life but of course it had to end on it. that is it. Back to my usual everyday shit. Therapist are not shit. Parents on their shit again. Everything is back to normal. Summer holidays just started and its only getting worse",0

"been having depression, panic attacks and derealisation episodes for quite some time now and it sucks that the only SSRI I can afford rn is Fluoxetine, which has not been working for me.

"I cannot take it any longer. Growing up had his ups and downs, my family was always great. Lost a few dear family members, lost my best friend at the age of 5.Growing up, I found out my dad has HIV, my mom lost a baby (always dreamt of having a Lil bro or sis) and had loads of issues, to the point where she needed surgery because her ovarians were full of tumors, lost my grandma, grandpa, my dad had an heart attack during those times.I had a 3 month girlfriend who got pregnant, I took the responsibility even though we did not knew each other enough. My son is now 2 years old and its the only thing I love about life. My girlfriend makes my life a living hell and I cannot take her shit anymore. Just today she admitted that she does not love me. I found out that she was having intimate conversations with some ex through social media too.I cannot be with her anymore, but cannot even imagine not being with my boy everyday. Just thinking about staying with her makes me want to die. I just want to be with my son, that is all I need. I need my boy man. I need him to be with me or else I cannot take this.I am a mess and so is this post. Just venting trying to avoid suicidal thoughts. My parents do not deserve to lose a kid.

"Stress, anxiety, depressive episodes, overeating. All of these things are a result of what I have been through. To top it all off I cannot go a single day without experiencing some kind of flashback\dejavu to a time where I was hurt or did something cringy. Sometimes I even catch myself reacting to it all over again and realizing I just did it again. The only way out of this hell hole is up and I just do not have the strength to get there. Living a normal life was never a requirement however living in general seems to be something I cannot do. Everything is too stressful. How people go about their daily lives as if nothing is wrong is beyond me. The constant up hill battle to improve my life would not be as bad if not for the immense emotional baggage I carry with me. Worst of all I cannot confide in anyone. Because I do not trust anyone. People are evil. They do what they want regardless of how it affects you. Above all I am tired. Tired of pretending to be happy. I am not happy. Never was. I was not happy when my mother would get drunk and curse at me for no good reason. I was not happy when I went through school and got stabbed over and over again with the same daggers from the same people. I was not happy when I graduated. I felt empty and exhausted all that changed was I was now living at the bitch drunks place 24\7. At least she is slowly killing herself from her wine. I am not happy now, and you know what? It fucking hurts. Things do not get better. I am too tired to try anymore I will probably clock out at the end of the year if not sooner. I need help that I will never get.",0

"I was naive enough to think that marriage and kids would mean eternal happiness.

My psych told i did not have all the points to have bipolar disorder, yet i have doubtsWhen I am good i can feel almost euphoric, really self confident, like everything in my life is at its right, everything will be fine, i am more social and i feel so full of love and positivity. This can go on for like almost a week but never more. And then boom, suddenly i feel like nothing makes sense anymore, hate my self, anxiety rising, I am isolating myself, suicidal blablabla this can go for like more than a week. I rarely find myself in a normal state.I have been under zoloft for 2 months and like the good phases feels just a bit more euphoric which i found like not weird, and the bad phases are less deeper which is good, but i still feel i cannot live a normal life anxiety is waaay better thoThe reason I am looking for answers is that I am wondering if i have the right treatement?

"I have posted here a few times under different names. I do not really know why. I guess I am hoping to feel better by shouting into the ether. I know this will not do anything and no one will see it, but I find that oddly comforting. I have spent so long being a locked box that I do not know how to be anything else anymore so knowing no one is listening and that no one can help is a comfort. I am almost 30,but I have always known where I would end up. Even when I was a kid, I would cry myself to sleep knowing that one day, I would make everyone and everything around me miserable. Lo and behold, here I am. Married. Like an idiot. I just wanted to hope, you know? I just wanted to try to fight some cosmic destiny that I felt was waiting for me. Maybe I was wrong? Maybe I could be happy? Maybe I could have a beautiful wife and child. But here I am. Married for 5 years and I have made the woman I love miserable. I have got a beautiful daughter that has to live with ME as a father. Why would I do that to someone? I am supposed to love these people and I was selfish enough to get involved in their lives. she is going to have some sort of emotional and behavioral issues just for being my daughter. Mental illness runs in the family, but I was too greedy to not walk away and let her live a life where she did not know me. Where my wife did not choose to marry me. And now they have to suffer for it. They have this waste of space of time in their lives because I was too much of a coward to end it when I was a teenager and now it is too late. I knew I would never be happy or make anyone happy since I was ten. And twenty years later, the proof is still here as plain as day, but I could not stop myself from trying to live a normal life. I could not accept that it was not what. I deserved. I know they will never see this. But I am sorry. I am truly sorry that you have had the horrible luck of meeting me. there is nothing I could do to ever make it up to either of you. I just hope you will forget me one day. This will get lost too. And that is okay.",0
"Hi, redditors. First time posting. Dunno where else to put this.Little background: I am a fit, healthy (mostly) M23 with a history of chronic and sometimes severe depression and frequent (daily) suicidal thoughts with a couple minor attempts some years ago... I am not on any meds but am contemplating taking them lately.My story of my sad summer (so far)This year started off pretty good, finally moved out for the first time last year and have been fairly happy. Have had no luck with the girls I like, even though I am apparently quite handsome. They just lose interest after a while and I have sort of given up on asking any out. Have moved into an apt. more recently with a longtime best friend from HS, which has been decent enough but we are drifting apart because of typical roommate shit. I have accepted it and I am okay with it, I think I would be fine without them in my life after this year. I do not have many friends otherwise though, and the new people I meet are mostly temporary friends. COVID restrictions in my city have also made it tough, particularly because I have not seen most of my extended family in over a year.Other than that I was having my hours gouged at work for a job and company I already hated, they cut me down to 12ish hours a week before I had enough. I would had a few thousand dollars saved so decided to quit. it is been fine since then, but money does not last forever and I do not have enough to support me for long. it is been a month with a little labor work on the side and I am nearly broke again. I was partying too much this summer in general so that does not help my money problem, going to the beach and drinking almost every day... doing coke all night with all kinds of people. From strippers to eccentric youths I have met at said beach. Gradually I began to feel I had a problem, tried to cut back and failed, every time I drink I just lose all inhibition. Finally quit for maybe a couple weeks and stayed sober, was tough but I am alive. Looking for a new job still, maybe not looking as hard as I should, then I get some bad news about my cousin, that is also my age and in the same city, who was partying (like me) and OD'd on drugs I have done before and nearly (or maybe lowkey did) OD'd on too... He was braindead and in hospital for a few days. Then another friend from HS few days later same thing. They died one day and the next. That was a week and a half ago, I broke my sober streak pretty fast. I never tell my parents this kind of shit and it hurts talking about my cousin and friend even more, especially when they say some dumb shit like how they were stupid for what they did etc... I have lost 3 friends my age to drug overdoses this year now and I think it is all just hitting me at once like the cars of a trainwreck smashing into one another and unable to stop.On the upside my best friend's birthday was this last week, though I almost did not want to go but convinced myself to so I could have a good time, and while on a raging bender I went with them and friends to another city to party. I think I drank almost constantly from breakfast to bed for at least 5 days straight and hardly ate a meal a day... It was a good experience all things considered, I made a lot of good memories in Montreal... that entire day and night of my friend's bday in particular was like an indie film... but I do not know if I have ever gone that hard in my life and it scares me in hindsight. I was doing a few different drugs with those friends on the birthday as well, literally all day, and disappeared with half of the drugs to go bar hopping when they did not want to go out of the air BnB we were staying in. They were not happy, and I did not have a working phone for them to call me on... or any of their phone numbers.That night was great but the day after... that hangover was the scariest I have ever had, and the day before we would all left to Mtl I broke my phone after getting home with a stockpile of booze so could not call anyone. I was pretty sure I would suffer a heart attack if I got up off my couch and decidedly stayed put for the entire first day and night I was back. My heart was POUNDING from the withdrawals as I would probably taken enough alcohol and coke / molly for three people. I think part of me wanted to die, though I do not think I would have as I am a fit 23 year old male but... I was pretty sure I would be the next of my friends to overdose that day. I like to think this has been transformative, but I am still drinking and I think I have a long way to go to get out of this rut I have dug myself into... but I have been here before. I tell myself I will not commit suicide, even if it feels like it would solve all my problems and set me free, because I do not want to hurt my family and friends. I feel I owe them all my life, hopefully a good life. I still think of jumping from my balcony every day though.Going to see my cousin's grave tomorrow and say goodbye finally. Lots of family will be there and I will be sober. it is going to be thunder showers all day so I got an umbrella. I think it is fitting. Maybe the hard rain will wash the tears from my face and the stains from my soul. I have been crying more these past weeks than I have through my entire adult life and I am ready for it to stop. I am not religious either, I still consider myself an atheist (not so sure lately) but I have prayed to ""god"" and asked to let me bear the burden of my family's grief so theirs might be lessened. Among other things. So I think this pain will never go away and I will just try to be strong for them and myself instead. I am not sure what I want from this post except to write about it and get it off my chest. it is been keeping me up tonight. Maybe I will start writing poetry again.So thank you for reading, if you did. I hope all of you out there stay well, there is beauty and meaning out there if you look for it. I have been finding much of it lately, just do not expect it to fall into your lap. Go out and find it. there is all kinds of wonderful things out there just waiting for someone to stand witness.

Hi guys its time for my death. This is my second proper suicide attempt and I am ready to die. I am ready for eternal blackness. I cannot wait to not be haunted by him anymore!!!I am so happy why am I crying? My nose is tied to the cieling,1
I do not know why but for about 3 months I have been feeling guilty like I am bottling something up and I feel really sad about it and it is making me feel anxious. I hope some other people have felt this because I find it very depressing and not as happy as I was. Can someone please explain why I am feeling this or if they have felt the same way. I always feel guilty,0

"I have escaped home because I was beaten up by my mom and brother, I have no where to go, there are no suicide hotline in my country. No support. No family. I can either kill myself or risk whatever is going to happen to me by night. I honestly do not know what to do at this point",1

"Does anyone else have horrible, horrible depression upon waking up every day? How do you manage it?I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 and struggle with it daily, but it seems to be worse in the morning, right when I wake up. As soon as I hear my alarm go off and I feel that initial exhaustion and reality sinks in, I get so depressed and anxious about the day ahead that it causes minor (and sometimes major) panic and I begin my descent into nervous, depressed, hopeless hell. I battle so hard with physically leaving my bed, getting ready, being engaged at work, etc.I think a lot of my depression is linked to the fact that I am not happy with my job and have no desire to be waking up and going to it. Its mundane and nothing remotely close to what I actually would like to do for a living. However, I kind of fell into my current field when I moved out and I have not had any luck over the last 7 months searching for something Id maybe enjoy. I was let down by how difficult it is to find a job after graduating college and now feel stuck in this corporate office environment.Anyway, does anyone have advice for how to deal with overwhelming morning depression? I try to focus on the little joys like seeing my dog in the morning and brewing the first cup of coffee, but even then I feel like I cannot possibly keep doing this much longer before I end up quitting my job. Immediate Morning Depression. Advice?",0
"I think I belong here now. My brother killed himself. I was angry and upset. I realize now that he was right. He was smarter than me. Why go through the divorce? the alienation from your kids? putting on weight? getting uglier? getting older? Working to make money to pay people you do not like and ti but shit you do not want? I mean fuck all of this. Did it hurt people, yeah. But people heal. Your life can remain hell for the rest of your life. Mine just keeps getting worse. I started on r/suicidebereavement",1
I do not know but I am also certain at the same time I feel lost I fear that my life will be going down hill but I also do not care as much as I did. I do not know why I wrote here I am very confused I am becoming more numb every day the only reason I have not done it is because I believe there might be a happy ending (after death) but sometimes I just ignore that thought and I dread almost everything Depressed... Maybe?,1
"When i discovered i had depression, i swore at myself that I will never consider suicide ever. But what can i do.I played Omori recently. I am not going to spoil the game but it had a good and a bad effect on me. The good part was that i understand how there is always a way to get out.By holding on to good things...But what if i had no more good things in my life.Un-understanding parents that are just mocking me 24/7 and telling me how my problems are not that bad even tho they areFriends who left me and spat on me when i needed them the most, and all of that because of a ridiculous story that everyone took to an extremeMyself who cannot stop insulting myself of all possible slurs and insults, and my inner voice making me having a self-hate so huge and deep i cannot put it in wordsAnd i never felt good ever. I only have traumatic and sad memories from my childhoodWhat do i do. Practically no one ever responds to these so if anyone has any idea, please help.Oh and my parents will not take me to another therapists since the 4 I have had did not help I just realised how hopeless my situation is",1
"I am soon to be 27. CD has left a big mark in my social life at this point. Not all of it comes down to my mental state and it is sympthoms of course, but most of it does.There is a matter that I would like some advice on, and I am afraid you will not read it if it is below a lot of text so I will ask it first. **Have you ever told a long time friend about your depression and how did it go? Could it be a good idea?** I am talking about long time friendship here, someone who did see me at my worst and still stayed a friend. I am afraid they will just see me as a burden. I mean, at this point, I am pretty sure they know, it shows from my behaviour. Then again, I feel like it would make things clearer between us. But then again, again, I am afraid it will just show me as sort of a weak link. Or worse, that it will just come as an excuse of all of my abnormal behaviour like not joining them for events, or leaving suddenly, refusing invitations for weeks etc...Now to the wall of text. I have tried to addsome jokes, and now I am afraid you will hate them.*It all went wrong when I was born* Or at about 15 years of age, at least that is as far as me and therapist got. Although it took me more than a decade to go to therapy, both me and family were sort of aware, to a degree. Although I did expect it to just be some trauma/anxiety due to one psycho ex, not a full blown clinical depression whose paranoia side she just enchanted with some actually justified fears. And the older I get, the more it shows. I could get by easily before, it was quirky to be absent minded, closed off and sometimes gloomy and social interactions and making friends or starting relationships took less effort when I was in high school. I did not exactly fit in, but I did not suffer a lot for it, so all was good. Over time, of course, when you ignore the signs, thing get worse. Lack of will to live, over sensitivity, panic attacks, darker and darker thoughts, all came by and did not leave ( unlike my exes ).Now, it takes more, and I feel like I do not have that ""more"". Turning down a wedding invitation because you dread the thought of large social gatherings is not quirky, it is a relationship ( friendly, not romantical ) ruining act. Also, I did not refuse the invite, I went there and hated myself during every moment of it like a man.Now due to my age, social interactions come with more expectations and consequences. And they obviously require some experience, or *people skills* which I just do not have. Small talk is pretty much impossible when you do not have the will to get out of bed, much less keep up with current events. Work also gets hard when any time someone does not approach me with a clear ""Hello"" leaves me thinking about why they hate me so much, and having so send two mails instead of one because I forgot to add the attachment leaves me in shambles, looking through job search engine, and being on my tiptoes for a week, despite the fact that my colleague lost us a cool 300K due to some copyright issues and nobody gave a fuck.I am a capable person. I know it. I have done things.Like, if boss wants me to work overtime during holidays, sort out an entire year worth of bills despite not being even remotely related to accounting and also deep clean all 7 offices we have around my town, I am their man. ( As long as they pay me, I am not a sucker ). But an invitation to a teambuilding event? Felt like shit, might quit on the spot and cry for weeks later,idk.Same goes for friendship. Just the two of us doing heroin and raping chicken in a satanic ritual in a private place? Sure. A party? No no no.*it is easy to fall in love with me, it is hard to love me every day*Those are lyrics to a song that resonated within me. I can be funny when I try. I can be charming. I even made a few self made jokes and quick quips which made people laugh that I hapily reminiscence about 5 years later. Also, while years of not giving a shit about my health annd constanly feeling like shit have left sizeable consequences to my body, I have a good looking face. As long as it is winter and I have 7 layers of clothing on me and a hat, I am hot. So, making those shallow relationships is easy. Going deeper is hard, which is also true for my sexual endeavours. And that sucks really. I know a lot of people have it harder, I am not trying to dunk on anyone with this, but knowing that up until a certain point I can be great, as a friend, as an employee, as a boyfriend, better than a lot people really, but there will be a line, whether it is something to be done, or say, or something will be brought up that will form that line, a line that I cannot cross has always shown up so far. And almost everyone crosses that line while I stay on the other side. That crushes me. I would like to chat about people in general, friendships and relationship. Your advice, observations and thougths are very desirable / needed.",0
"Dealing with so much pressure, grief, loss, stress. Feels like I am delaying the inevitable and causing myself more pain. I am stuck in lose-lose-lose.

"I could not sleep tonight so I wrote it out and threw it into the void hoping that will help somehow.""what is your name?"" I ask her""I am your rival,"" she replies I pushed myself further back into the old red pews, they squeaked at my movement. The guy beside me stared at his phone. ""I do not remember you,"" I say.""What happened to you?"" She asks me.I look down at my hands. I do not want to be here, i do not want to have this conversation. I barely wanted to come into this building in the first place. I snuck up here to avoid the other kids my age. The guy beside me looks up at the girl with a calm but stern expression. He does not seem too excited about randon conflict popping up out of nowhere.""Dawn, it does not matter,"" he says. he is Asian, my guess is Philippino. His hair is short, he is about 5.8, muscular build with the aura of ""confident athlete church guy"" if that is a thing. ""You remember her, do not you?"" Insists Dawn. The guy frowns. I lower my eyes, feeling deeply self conscious. This is why I did not want to come here in the first place. Back in this place so much of who I was was shaped here. I stood on that stage and will always vividly remember making people laugh so hard their faces were red. I got second place. I was 11. I lost to this girl, I guess. I did not even remember her name. I think she sang that song from Walk To Remember. She must be older than me. I do not know why she thought I was her rival. Although i was clearly better than her on that stage she did win the talent show so who really cares?""Some things happened to me,"" i say. ""Who did this to you?"" She asks leaning her face in closer.Why is she still talking to me?""Whoever it is I am going to go after them!"" She says. I frown. That does not mean anything to me. People think I look so different, so much darker, hide in the corner and keep my hat or hood over my face, and avoid performing unless I have to, is because I was raped or beat up at work but I was not. And I do not want anyone to harm those who made me this way. I think, anyway. ""I am sorry to disappoint you. I am not the rival you wanted,"" I say.She sits down beside the guy shoving me over closer to the edge of the pew. The guy puts his arm around her shoulder, I guess they are dating. I sigh inwardly. I was supposed to be like that, you know. I was supposed to be in the cute church couple with the pretty voice and the charisma. I was supposed to be on Dawn's level. Turns out I am some antisocial emo chick still in her room reading manga with her headphones in and a keyboard. Please do not look at me, Dawn. Please do not scrunch up your nose and make it so obvious that I am not the same person I was. I am sorry I disappointed you. I cannot bring myself to tell you about it, and you have not earned it anyways. It does not really matter, it is just defined me and completely remade me into whatever this is. I am not your rival anymore. I do not belong here anymore. Please do not sympathize with me. I do not want it. do not be angry, do not be sad. do not be anything. Forget me. Forget who I made laugh, forget every cringey, funny, cute, strange thing I did here. I only came here to learn and sing quietly. I came early to find my seat to avoid such interactions. I get up, I feel anxious squished by the perfect couple. I do not remember where I went. Just the corner of the room, like a theater in that room I was not supposed to be in anymore. I hope you win again, Dawn. I hope we never meet again. I feel guilty for how I turned out after trauma and last night I had a vivid dream about it. it scared tf out of me",0
I have been depressed for about 4 and a half years and well go start with I have never known if i actually am. I was never called depressed officially but I am on antidepressants on the advice of a psychiatrist. I have always felt like I am making it up for attention.I have also never self harmed which to be clear I am very glad about. But everyone i know who is depressed has self harmed and I just feel like this adds to my concerns that I am making this all up.Is it normal that I am depressed and have never self harmed or felt the desire to?

When the pandemic hit I was hitting the bottle a little too hard like finishing a bottle tequila every other day. I sought help from the therapists we have at work. We get 6 sessions and for whatever reason this therapist saw how broken I was and continued therapy for a whole year without mentioning our limit has long been passed. He finally did this past week. I knew it was coming and bless his heart for going above and beyond. I am completely sober but just as depressed. I cannot fathom opening up all over again. I am sinking and this time I am not even trying to save myself. My hygiene has been horrid I am glad we have lotion and perfumes to hide the worst of it. To make matters worse my so called friends decided to go out without inviting me but had the nerve to send me tons of photos of how much fun they were having. I blocked them all. Its exhausting even contemplating therapy from scratch. Its scary not having a lifeline yet its so difficult reaching out for help. Thanks for reading. Finding a therapist,0

"I tried to kill myself a couple weeks back. As I am writing this, in fact, I am trembling with temptation, spiralling into only the start of a dreadful depressive episode.It was horrendous, I was looking over that wall, scraping it with rage, my nails collecting the crumbs of cement underneath them.I was on the third floorOf my school building.Id just run out of the deputy principals office. Why was I there? I do not quite remember. Could be a few things. But she was taking too long, my head overflowing with suicidal thoughts, I bolted.Next thing I knew I was looking down. The cement on the floor, the tree, I could just reach from the wall the leaves cold and wet, so were my fingers, my eyes, stinging, so very sore from holding back so much emotion, they were sensitive to the touch, freezing cold rage streaming down my cheeks, my will to live fading before my eyes as I went to thrust myself over something, someone, pulled me back.My deputy principal, smiling back at me, gripping my arm firmly.Please I pleaded. She quietly and gently but forcefully led me down to her office and talked to me with the councillor.One thing I will never be able to wrap my head around is that, that wall,Is right next to a staff room. With staff in it. Teachers. Adults, were in there.And I know, I saw them. Not one even thought to even ask me why I was out of class.I am not at all ok, at the moment. But so so so many good things have happened since then.Just remember that,Suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem.And if everyone has forgotten to tell you this, you are awesome, and I love you.

"I am an 18 year old trans guy. I do not think words can appropriately express how much I fucking hate myself. I know I am never going to be a real man, and I am never going to be attractive to anyone but my current partner. Cis guys work out to get ripped and hot. I work out just for my body to remotely resemble that of a man. I know that in order to look like a guy I am going to need thousands of dollars of surgery, including plastic surgery to masculinizar my face. I have been on testosterone for more or less a year and all that is improved is a little bit of hair and a slightly deeper voice. I feel like a mutilated hairy woman. I feel disgusting. I come across gay men in the internet who would never accept me as one of them much less be attracted to me. I feel like a total fraud. Everyone at work respects my pronouns but only because its company policy, not because they see me as a real man. The more testosterone I take, the worse my acne gets, and the more bloated I become, this driving me towards worse self esteem. I know the effort necessary for me to be passable and attractive is so much that I would have to center my life around it and make enormous sacrifices to do so. I also dropped out of high school my senior year. I had a 4.2 weighted gpa, tons of AP classes, countless teachers ready to write me shining letters of recommendation. I was President and founder of my schools film club, I was an activist and a member of many other student clubs and organizations. I was on numerous occasions pulled aside by various teachers to be told I was a favorite student and that I was going places. I was also heavily involved in volunteering and was even appointed to leadership positions within the organization I volunteered with outside of school. I scored 5s on all of my AP tests and was often the only one in my year to do so. This year as my former peers are graduating, I am scrolling through their Instagram pages as I get off a 9 hour shift at my shitty restaurant job. I see that multiple of my peers are attending ivy leagues and other schools of similar ranking. This confirms what I long suspected and longed for - I could have easily been admitted to many of the top schools that my peers got into seeing as I outperformed the vast majority of them both in academics and in extracurricular activities. I really fucked that up. But at the same time I intensely hate all of those people I attended school with and am glad I am not surrounded with the likes of them anymore. Why? Because the majority of them were super privileged neoliberal assholes that ostracized me for being different and only tolerated me because I was smart and over-achieving. To make matters worse I honestly miss a lot of aspects of being a girl. I was always the best dressed in school but I never got verbal attention for it because I was an outsider. Instead people just stared at me as I walked down the halls with high heels and a perfectly curated vintage outfit. I had the perfect female body and a pretty face. Even though I was always uncomfortable and everything felt like a performative sham, I was insulated from the outside world and I felt like I had some value. Now i just feel like a chubby, unattractive, worthless blob. Its disgusting . I was also severely depressed and anorexic before my transition and although the anorexia has since disappeared I almost miss it. Its gotten to the point that my self esteem is so low that I cannot orgasm unless my boyfriend calls me a fag or puts his hand across my mouth (which I ask him to do by the way). Now he sometimes refuses because hes seen the effect it has on me so instead I just imagine it even more degrading in my head. I go through suiCidal episodes where I feel like I truly want to die but later when I calm down I want to try to feel better if not for me then at least for the world.

I almost feel resentment towards my parents because they saw how I was acting and the things I was doing to other people. It makes me feel bad because I know its not their fault, we could not afford it and our insurance did not cover pediatric mental health. I just wish I had that chance to be a better person who could better handle their mental health. I feel like I could have had a chance to be better.",0

there are things in my life and problems i literally cannot avoid and things going on in my head that the only way to make them stop is to kill myself but i do not feel valid. like if i were to kill myself people would not get it or would say i made a mistake and that i was fine but i do not want to do this anymore. i do not want to keep pushing. i do not know how much longer i can and all i want is for everything to just stop and the only way for that to happen is death. I am convinced suicide is the only way to escape,1
"I feel really stuck. It just feels like there are just so many things going on even though nothing's actually going on. Currently I am a high schooler, and I live with my extremely homophobic parents (who I have yet not come out to) and they are the main sources of my suicidal thoughts. My mother is also abusive and hits or berates me whenever I do something even slightly wrong, which causes a lot of anxiety for me when I mess something up. But even without their influence, I can only manage to think about how much I am failing and lagging behind everybody else and that I am worthless. And when I try to take one small step at a time trying to finish anything, I get easily distracted and end up not finishing even after hours have gone by. I have not been sleeping or eating at all. Suicide feels like the only option left, but I want to hold on for those around me who love me, but I do not know how long i can last feeling this low. I am stuck.",1
"So I am 20 years old and I havnt been in a good mental place for a long time. I spend as much time as I can alone just because going out with friends and seeing them happy just makes me mad that I cannot be like that no matter what I try. For the longest time I have experienced a whole bunch of sexual problems (ie. cannot get it up, have never came from any type of sex, and have no sex drive at all). Recently I have started to realize that I think the root of my unhappyness has something to do with this. My testosterone is pretty low for a guy my age but not low enough to where I could go on any therapy for it.I just sort of wanted to ask any guys (or girls) if they have the same issues? Like I feel like if I could do something about not being able to have sex I would be so much happier all around. Root of problems",0

I am sick of being treated like a lesser being because I am not torturing myself in this society because I refuse to live in horrendous conditions: unless my existence is dedicated to working then I will never have money and if I do dedicate to only working all the time then I will never be happy so what is the point? Where am I supposed to feel ashamed for denying this kind of life?...everything sucks If society says I do not deserve anything because I refuse to work myself to mental death for absolutely nothing to make up for it in return then I am happy to sign out,1

"Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time? I suck at everything and have no friends to have fun with. The ones I had I ruined it.

What in the hell do you get out of bed for? And the worst part of all this is that no matter how many times I try to think a way of this, I end up getting nowhere. Because there is nowhere to go. There is no such thing as a life worth living. The tomorrow I am working towards will never come.This cycle never ends. I will continue to come to the realization that I do not belong here and then right after come to the realization that there is nothing I can do about it.

My life has taken a huge turn for the better. All though high school I was extremely depressed and when I finally got out I hoped it would be better. I tried to go to college but I flunked out and that of course just made everything worse. I went back home got a crappy job at an Applebees and started dating a crappy guy. The guy and I got into tons of fights. He was stealing from me. He lived in my apartment for free and he brought his other girlfriend over and fucker her on my couch. I only found out when I decided to get Instagram again and found his profile and that said he was dating someone else and she told me she went to his place and they had sex on his couch. I found her lip gloss in my couch a month after I threw him the hell out. I was livid. After hun and I broke up I got even more depressed I spent a whole week in my bed crying. I ended up downloading whisper and when guys started hitting on me I did not stop them. Eventually I stupidly went to one guys place because I was lonely. I told him I was dtf but not anal. Of course he gets me a red solo cup of wine and when I am only nursing it he starts pressuring me to drink more telling me I can stay the night. I did not finish the cup but I did drink more after that. Then he starts giving me edibles. I got to the point where I was almost completely out of it. He tied me up and fucked my ass. I then proceeded to just into yet another toxic as hell relationship with an guy who was married and told me he was in an open relationship (but of course never let me actually meet his wife). That was a disaster. Hes getting a divorce now. (Allegedly having nothing to do with me but do we really believe that folks?) I got a new job and my boss started sexually harassing me. Literally invited me to an orgy. He also like to hit his dab pen in the office and I got a bad habit of joining him. That never got worse than that tho because this is when I started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. My boyfriend and I started dating shortly after I got that job. Hes the most amazing man I have ever met. He cares for me. Really cares. He loves me and I love him. I got another serving job again and stayed there for about 6 months before finally getting into an office job.Now I am happier than I have ever been. My job is great for me and has helped my mental health a ton. My bf and I have been together 10 months and are going strong. I just want to put out there that no matter how bad life seems it can get better. Thank you for reading my story. TLDR: my life sucked now my life does not suck. I am glad I never committed suicide.,0
Last time I did it I vomited. The wine is very warm which probably will make me throw up again. The flat I rented to kill myself is so shitty it has no fridge even (I did not know some flats do not have fridges). I am scared of throwing up again and not dying. If only I will not vomit again while taking pills and wine then this all would be over,1
"My friend relies on my very heavily for emotional support and it can be extremely draining. I do not have the heart to tell her this because I know what its like to feel like a burden to someone. I am not as open with her about my feelings and how I am also struggling a lot, but maybe I should try and be more vocal about my feelings? Idk its just so hard when someone you care about really needs your help and to be listened to. But its painful having to be the rock when your own life is falling apart and now feeling like I am somewhat responsible for her safety too. I am self harming while trying to comfort her over text and I feel like its just not a healthy way to be. I am just looking for some words of support or advice if you have any.

"I just wish that life was different. My life is not even that bad on the outside, I have a great family, I live in a decent area, I do not really have many external struggles, and when I say that I do not mean to brag I am simply saying it for a little bit of context. I am 19 years old and for as long as I can remember I have just had this emptiness inside of me. I do not like to talk about it a lot with the people around me but it really is something that just eats at me. It feels like there is no middle ground for my emotions. One minute I can feel like life is great and the next I just wish I had not been born in the first place. I just wish I was not here. I have felt this way since I would say I was around 11 or 12. It feels like any bit of happiness I get is just a temporary high but I always come down and sink into this dark place that I cannot crawl out of. No matter what I just always end up finding myself in this pit. I just think of how I wish none of this had ever happened, I could have just not been born. I think about suicide a lot, but its not something I truly want to act on. Its not that I want to die, I do not truly want to die, I just wish Id never been here. I am not necessarily afraid of death, it feels like I am just kind of waiting for it to happen. I would not search for it but I am also not afraid of it happening. Id like to think that it would be comforting to know that everything just goes away. It would just be over. No more stress, no more sadness, no more worrying about this or that, just the peaceful notion that I do not have to deal with anything anymore. Does anybody else feel this way? I am tired of living a day to day life and feeling like I am trapped in this reality I want nothing to do with. I just want to be at peace. I just wish it had never happened in the first place. I just wish it was over",0

While taking a walk in a forest, I realized I am at the lowest point in my life. I do not necessarily feel sad, it is hard to put into words. I have sudden urges to randomly cry yet I do not feel ""sad""I do not find any joy in life whatsoever. Every day feels like a chore, simply waking up is painful, as I open my eyes my thoughts start running, thinking of everything that bothers me about life.Dad, I love you. We do not talk much, we are both on the less talkative side but trust me I have never been mad at you and love you to death. you have been an amazing dad and nothing was your fault.Mom, I talk with you a lot more and love you just as much as dad. I can not imagine how you are feeling reading this letter, I do not expect you to understand nor accept this, but have peace in knowing I am happy, do not feel sorry for me, please. I have lots of friends, quite a few good ones even. I have an amazing family, yet I still feel alone somehow.Brother, you have been amazing my entire life, I know we do not spend time together anymore, but from the time we have spent you will always be the best bro.To everyone else, sorry for not naming you, you all have a place in my heart. I simply do not see the point in continuing this misery. As clich as it sounds, it all just feels so pointless. The aforementioned walk in a forest that made me realize all of this, I have never walked there before, yet it felt like a routine. Everything I do feels like a routine, I do not even feel control over myself. It almost feels like I have a certain path that I must follow - one that leads to continuous emptiness. Suicide is a way to break the cycle, not the best way, but the only one my simple brain could come up with Suicide note",1

"I work alone overnight and I decided to *not* have my headphones in for my nightly dose of escapism this time and to just let my thoughts wander. In the past 30 mins I thought about all the things that make me miserable (my self body-image, the fact that my bf and I have nothing in common, the fact that my parents only want me around to use me for favors, being unemployed after having been fired from my career job, how easy it is for me to fall into a toxic binge drinking spree, and my sick dog as well as the existential dread that comes with acknowledging how quick a dog's life is ) And I also thought about all the things that make me happy (My body when I treat it right and exercise, the fact that I have a bf and someone who loves me, the fact that both of my parents are still around and I can visit them, the freedom I have from not being stuck to some shit career position I actually hated, how much fun I have when I party with my friends, and how happy my dogs make me when I see their faces first thing in the morning)And it made me realize that everything in my that makes me momentarily happy or miserably depressed are two sides of the same fucking coin and I am so sick of this game. it is a game I will never win. Nor do I care to at this point. If it was not for the fact that I damn well know I will be traumatizing those who care about me, I would get drunk, blast my favorite 90s alternative metal song, and drive off a bridge.

"To keep a long story short :August 2020 : I met a girl who had a long distance relationship. We kept dating because we like each other.November 2020 : I was diagnosed with burnout/depressionDecember 2020 : she breaks up with her long distance relationship.February 2021: we tried to have sex but I had sexual dysfunction due to my burnout. She told me she was ""turned off"" because of it. She started to became distant and told me it was for other reasons than sexual dysfunction. I kept reaching to her because I was totally addict.June 2021 : we kept dating during all this time. after months of arguments (me asking her why she was acting distant) she broke up with me and tells me she was dating a new guy since 3 weeks ago.2 days ago I unfollowed her on social medias to help myself moving on. She was not watching my stories anymore anyway. I begged her to stay with me for a month. The day after I unfollowed her she unfollowed all my friends and asked her sister to unfollow me too. Why did she did this ? How did her noticed so rapidly that I unfollowed her ? Was she still looking at my account ?Do I have any chance to win her back after all this ? Thanks ! Help ! Will she come back ? :(",0
"My Will / My LifeI lived a good life honestly, nothing bad really happened. I did not commit crimes, I did not get a severe illness that left me bedridden or had me killed, I did not go out of my way to harass people online or in person. I am not a saint though. I have thought about killing strangers, people I did not like, friends, family, and myself. I have thought about the darkest things that I have wanted to do to people that I will not enclose in this document because I want the memory of what my family and friends to think of me to at least be half decent. The truth is though that my mind has been fucked for a few years, and its because of internet exposure, the curiosity of wanting to see more and more rather than hearing about it.If you are reading this its probably because I killed myself, here is why.# Why I Did itI have been thinking about killing myself for years. I have been thinking about harming myself for about the same time, but I never went out of my way to do it. My mom, my sister, and hell, even my girlfriend all have cut themselves and self harmed. It makes me want to puke and panic whenever I think about it. I wish they would have never done it, because I continue to be saddened by it even now. I have trouble being happy knowing that they have harmed themselves, that they have cried for hours about their troubles. It hurts that I cannot do anything to help at all, and it hurts that I do not go the extra mile to help them even further It is not that I do not want to, but I never had went out of my way out of pure laziness and being pathetic all around.I am a loser. I can barely take care of myself. I have periods of time where I do not shower for days or brush my teeth, I skip meals, I buy food despite having full capabilities that I can cook food myself that would be much cheaper and nutritious. I do not do well in school. If I truly try, I can get good grades. But for some fucked reason, I never do. I am always finding myself finding any excuse to not study or do homework, and when a time comes that I truly want to, I shit you not, SOMETHING COMES UP. Not sure how the fuck it happens, but I swear family/friends will need help or invite me to go out when I want to do homework, and I can never say no. And that is part of my downfall. When something inconvenient happens to me, I get very upset, more than the average person would. When a person upsets me, I think of killing them, and other things I will not mention. This clearly is not fucking normal, and I think its good that I will be taking my life rather than being completely stupid and taking innocent lives. I have no idea why I have friends or even a girlfriend if I am honest. I would claim to be very charismatic ,handsome at times, and manipulative, but as of writing right now I cannot think of a time that I have manipulated someone. And for some weird reason, my gut says that I have. I think I had been a good ear for many people, I will not bother listing because they know who they are. I give the best feedback for them, whether its siding with them, telling them straight up This is how the world works, or telling them that they are wrong (Whether its factual or my opinion) I make sure to tell them what I think is right, and I think it has helped.I get a pain in my heart after I eat food that is extremely unhealthy, like mcdonalds, or drinking an energy drink. And I think to myself Let me get a heart attack and just die Because that is truly what I want. I want to die constantly. I imagine scenarios where the house breaks and the roof falls on top of my head. I think to myself of shooting someone in a random store in hopes of someone conceal carrying to finish me. I think of falling off a bridge or a cliff. But most importantly, I think of shooting myself in the head with my gun, which is what I will do.I get random periods of time where I REALLY want to kill myself. Had my gun been on my desk as I typed this, I feel like I would had pulled the trigger a few minutes ago, but I feel better now. Buying the gun was the biggest mistake in my life. Not because guns are bad, but because I am bad. I clearly do not deserve a right to own a gun, but here I am with a glock in my backpack. I do not think I could ever kill myself by jumping off a bridge or cliff, or cutting my wrists and bleeding out, etc. I had felt my glock has always been an optional exit for my in life, in case I truly fail as a person,And as it stands, I failed.

"I am so tired of everything, I have not seen a psychologist or a psychiatric in months (they never call me back but oh well), I hate the fact that my psychologist sent me to a psych ward again two months ago. I have given up on getting better honestly. I am not saying I am going to kill myself just yet, but it would not be the first (or second, or third, or fourth...) time I have tried to. I do not care if MAYBE things get better, I just do not know how long I can hold on. I have got my bf and my best friend (and only friend tbh) who are supporting as best as they can, but it is so hard. I cannot keep having these damn hallucinations and voices CONSTANTLY but whenever I tell my psychologist, she just tells me it is part of my anxiety and depression. From what I mentioned on an ALT account a while back, people seem to think that Schizophrenia is the most likely thing. I have pretty much lost touch with reality, I genuinely do not know what is real and what is fake anymore. All my meds are useless and I always feel like trash. I just wish I was not born, or I was born normal like everyone says. My dad hates me, my mum does not understand me and my sister just tells me to off myself already and stop wasting everyone is time. I am starting to see that that is my only option. Why so I have to keep suffering? Why cannot I just die already? But no, I cannot. I have to act like everything is okay, like I am fine. I can find comfort in my bf and best friend, my favorite videogames, horror movies, musicals and drawings. they are literally the only things I can 'feel good around'. And to quote the perfect line for my feelings: ""there is nothing for me here. I am alone, forsaken, invisible.""-Lydia Deetz. I mean, if I cannot even stop crying, how can I stop myself from dying? I will shut up now, so if you actually read all of this silly rant, thank you. I do not really have much to give, but I can make you a little drawing if you would like. I imagine you are going through a lot too, and I hope things get better. I will not lie to you, I cannot guarantee it, but I am here if you just want someone to listen.

I feel like no one wants me and I am burden to everyone. I do not even want me. Every time I drive alone I have to fight this urge to press on the gas and end it all. I have nothing going for me and nothing that makes me happy. I am a full time student and a full time employee when I am not in school. my entire life is surrounded by saving money and making enough money to afford college just so I can earn my phD. All I want to do is earn it so I can help people and have enough money to live comfortably. It seems dumb to complain when so many have it worse and my dad has taught me my feelings are never valid and will never be because someone will always have it worse than me. I have no friends to seek help from or distract me. My family is extremely toxic and my father is borderline mentally abusive. I have 6 roommates at school who are very selfish and will throw you under a bus if it benefits them. I love learning and it is a great distraction but it leaves me so stressed because I can barley afford it. I have no purpose or sense of direction. I am completely lost and have nothing to live for i feel like i should just kms,1

I am here typing this, crying and feeling so so so upset. i should have did it the other day. i should have continued the plan. i should not have stopped. i want to die. i feel so upset and frustrated and sad. this feels worse than last year. this feels worse than the first time something similar happened i hope i die in my sleep soon",1
You ever just wonder why you still exist in this world? Like rn I am stuck in a toxic relationship that makes me hate life more than anything. I want to be happy so bad but I cannot get away from them and its so sickening. I have attempted suicide recently to escape this person and they took me to the ER sadly and I am still here clearly. I just do not get why I cannot just be happy. I am medicated and I go out in the world but its always just a fake happiness. Like I find peace in the thought of my death. It just sounds calm and nothing further negative can continue on. Its just a nothingness void. All I have is crappy luck and a brain that wants me to self destruct. Anyone else? You ever just wonder,1

"I have been depressed for years, meds do not seem to help. Already attempted a few times, seems like no one wants to let me go.... but the same people also never listen to me or to what I have to say. I feel it is so pointless being alive. I am constantly getting blamed for something I did not do, and no matter how I defend myself, people assume that I really did it. One time I called the cops because a customer was being very rude and aggressive. They never came and I called in the afternoon. The next day the same customer comes back to the store with 2 cops. The 2 cops take me to the back room and say ""we can either do this here or take you back to the police station and arrest you"". Like what do mean...... obviously I would rather do ""this"" here then go to a police station and get arrested. Anyways the cops pull out 4 pieces of paper with 8 size print, top to bottom with text and there like"" sign here, sign her and here"". Like I have no idea what I am signing and it would probably take be a while to read it all. After I signed the cops say that I am being charged for assault.... cops said the customer ""fears for his life"" and that I had hit him. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!??!?! Never touched the guy and not only that, I called in the day before and put in a report, and no one showed. Yet this guy gets 2 cops, says these lies and they just charge me for assault, did not talk to any of my coworkers, or check any of the 4 cameras in our store..... wow so this is how easy it is to be a cop? No detective work at all, no evidence that I touched the guy. Just some guy that said I had assaulted him. Fuck this guy and fuck these cops. End up spending $300 on a lawyer to write a letter to the cops that charged me, and not until 1.5 months later the cop finally calls me and drops the charges. Ngl I was super stressed for weeks. Idk this is just some of the things that keep on happening to me. does not matter where I go, it is like bad luck I guess. I rarely go out, really only to get groceries. I feel like everytime I go out, something bad happens to me, and the few people around me just like to ""push my buttons"" or poke at me? I do not really know how to describe it but, it just does not make me feel any better. Any turn I take happens to be the wrong one all the time. I dunno, it seems like stuff like this only happens to me. So I decided that there is a few more things that I want to do and then do the deed Death will stop it all?",1

My husband is in a bad place with having to deal with his aging father and manipulative mother so I have to hold it together for him. I have no one else that I am close to so I never talk to anyone. I feel like I am drowning. I have no healthy coping mechanisms and most of the time just try to distract myself from reality. I want so badly to get help but I do not even know how to begin doing that let alone how to pay for it. I cannot do this anymore. I am so scared that one of these days I will not be strong enough to stop from doing something drastic. I am so tired of everything. I am not strong enough for this",0

"Hello Reddit! I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language. Any sort of advice, words of kindness would truly help. Thank you.I have made a post on this account before, and writing my feelings out made my pain feel a little more bearable, so I hope this does the same. I was born in a typical central European family with a loving mother, a slight narcassistic father who I dearly love and my two older sisters. My whole life always felt a little bit misplaced. My school grades were always very good, and I was reading quite advanced books from an early age, which had some consequences like; growing up too early and costant boredom at school because I did not get enough of a challange. My social life had been very poor, and I was getting constantly picked on which resulted in a low self-esteem and depression. I was eleven when I first tried to kill myself. I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for about six months, and finally got off anti-depressants last August. (Two years later).This year has been very tough. After I switched schools I have met a boy who I had feelings for and for the first time in forever, I felt truly happy. After being friends for eight months, he lead me in the woods and took advantage of me. Things have not been the same. It took me three months to hug my mom after that. I never told my family, but I did tell my closest friends. It hurted seeing him laugh with his friends, living his best life while I was sitting at the back of the class holding in another panic attack. But I can always remember who was always willing to take a walk and let me rant about my feelings, spend some silly young times together and take on the world like it was ours. It was my best friend, neighbour and someone you could call a blood-unrelated older sister. She took her life a month ago, on the hill we used to make memories on.I wonder where she is now. Dealing with her death has been a very tough experience I cannot describe. Some feelings words just cannot get a grip of. I am celebrating my fifteenth birthday in five days, and I still cannot believe I made it this far. Maybe I do not have a will to live right now, but maybe my point of living is to find it.The stars shine a little brighter now that you have joined them, Ana. My best friend took her own life",0

"And has life gotten better?&amp;#x200B;No. Everything is worse.I had some depressive bouts leading up to 21 over how much I was missing out on things that would make me happy. I had never had a date, let alone a relationship, never drank or went to parties and had wild fun like the other people my age I was too meek and scared of everything and despite constant jobhunting, my age and inexperience only ever got me a part time job cleaning public toilets, which did not help as I already felt gross. I disliked myself quite a lot, as I was overweight, short, unhygienic, unattractive, and I acted goofy, childish, loud and overly sensitive. But I can say that I was a hopeful optimist. I still kind of liked myself; I believed I was a good person with a good mind, worthy of love and acknowledgement, and had dreams of working in my creative talents with my then-friends, falling in love, and generally never wanted much like a ton of money or any unique opportunities, just the average house and family life that everyone tends to get, which has always been my focus. And it seems easy enough for everyone else to get, right?I tried. I mean, I really did try, for a decade. I jobsearched like crazy for years while bouncing around my familys homes, doing unpaid work experience after unpaid work experience just to have enough skills to actually be employable, for something other than needing a friend of a parent to put a good word in for me to even qualify as a toilet cleaner. When my dad said he was moving away to live with his new family he invited me to come, but I was 25 and already felt like a leeching loser, so lived off beans and boiled potatoes just to afford a spare room in a house share enough to be out of his way. I got into being more healthy and lost 55lbs during that time, cleaned up my hygiene and nutrition. It stuck, and I now go months without eating any sugar, learnt to cook well, and exercise every day. I went back to university to meet new people, as all my friends had drifted off in life or abandoned me altogether, and I also still had not had a relationship, so thought it would be a great way to meet likeminded people; adult connections that stick around and are mutual, as opposed to the ones Id made in childhood that had drifted off around 21. It was draining, but I did manage to graduate. Trying to study, work, look after myself and meet people was hard to do all at once because I never really was good at growing up Id had a 4 year agoraphobic stint in my teens that had given me anxiety and really damaged my ability to socialise or develop like a normal person, I have been unable to relax in normal situations or properly approach mandatory experiences of growing up like other people do. I was trying really hard to push through it though. I really did try.And what did I get for trying?I managed to upgrade my part-time minimum wage toilet cleaning job to a part-time minimum wage retail job, and have been stuck there for 5 years. I cannot advance in it because my completely broken social skills and introversion makes me really awful at customer service. And because my degree was creative where employability is based off contacts, privilege and experience, I am still no more employable or liable for better work than I was before university, I just have more debt to pay back. I went to study film, which has always been something I have loved probably the only thing in life I have ever felt *in* love with. After college, which ended when I was 20, I felt a bit like the magic had gone, because I saw behind the curtain which took a bit of the magic away, but was still interested in a career in it. Now after university, at 29, I despise it. I have no interest in working in film. 90% of my hobbies were creative based, and I do not even have any creative ideas anymore. I carried this internal sense of imagination and a case of maladaptive daydreaming with me for so long in my life that it was a huge part of me, but now all creativity is drained and I do not know who to be without it. My head is so out of it, I can barely register and react to things that happen in the *real* world anymore, let alone create complex things in my head. Sometimes I react late to conversations *I am in the middle of.* My cognitive function has crashed and I do not even think I could handle a harder job than retail now. But film was a secondary reason to study, I went to uni to open up socially and actually feel like part of the human race again. And did I? No. I did not have a single date, a single relationship, I did not make a single close friendship or helpful connection, because I am awful and broken and not likeable, interesting or attractive enough for people to want to put effort in for or stick around with anyway. My social skills are actually worse, because my mental health problems and self-image are worse. The idea of love and relationships have always been a huge trigger for my anxiety, probably because I wanted it so much (having a family was basically my biggest life dream), but my self-esteem is so non-existent that my philosophy now is, if I like someone, they are already too good for me. And now its pretty much impossible because I have come to find people so insanely confusing and unrelatable and I have not found anyone that comes close to otherwise in over a decade. At least at 21, I kind of understood the generation I was around, but the world seems so scary and aggravating and confusing now, I do not know how I am supposed to relate to any of the younger people I am around who want to follow each others social media accounts or talk in memes, when I am older and just want to have real conversations. How the fuck do university students manage to get into so many relationships when they just seem to talk about weird shit they saw online and the sesh? I do not understand people anymore, and my odds of finding a new best friend or a relationship have plummeted to non-existent as a result. I have not been really timid and untrying throughout this time either. I genuinely got involved, put myself out there, engaged in conversations despite being a massive introvert, even arranged some days out, started drinking and went to a few parties, and tried my best to be human. But apparently people did not find the attempt good enough. No-one has ever shown an interest in wanting a connection with me. Th biggest change in life I got out of university was getting wasted for the first time, but that has now evolved into me just wanting to drink all the time, despite the fact that drinking only every makes me cry anymore, I still just want to do it every night. I do not because I had an alcoholic mum growing up, and I also still try to tell myself I want to focus on being healthy and nutritional. And especially mental health-wise, people say that stuff helps. But does it? No. that is bullshit. I do not eat anything that is not nutritionally beneficial, I get so many vitamins a day and only eat fresh meat and veg. And yet, I am still tired and sad all the time, and most of my joints and bones constantly crack and hurt. And do I feel better about myself after all the effort and worry I put into reading every food packet, forcing myself out of bed to work out, forcing down disgusting, flavourless meals because I am paranoid about the extra calories sauces and flavouring would add? No. I have developed a massive case of body dysmorphia, I find myself grotesque and I despise myself more than ever. I used to just dislike myself physically and behaviourly but now I do not even think I am human. I used to know I was overweight, but still likeable enough to not die alone. But damn, now I envy the people that get to cut me a wide berth. *I am* stuck with having to be around myself. If I were any of the people I am attracted to, *I* would not want me kissing me or making eye contact during conversation with me either.If getting 50,000 into student debt still cannot get me a relationship or friendship, if focusing and stressing so hard about what I eat and how I live still makes me even more utterly hateful of myself, if creativity was my passion and now my head is so disoriented and depressed that my ability to be creative has completely died for good, then I think I have tried enough. I cannot keep trying and failing. I am pretty sure I am done.I am not an 18 year-old who still has their best years ahead of them. I am 30. I have statistical, experience-based evidence that it does not get any better. I refuse to try for another 30 years and potentially get my first date or my first proper job at the age of 50. At that point, its just not worth it to me, and I know there are going to be some people who say it is who say life begins at 40 - but it is not. For most people, life begins at 16; from there, they make close friends, learn to drive, have wild sexual encounters and spontaneous travel adventures, find a home they feel comfortable in and have the strength and energy to make money to maintain it, and most importantly, they find love with someone who thinks they are worth something. I have done none of those things. But I *promise you,* I have tried.I am a logical person. I am a third of the way through my life, and its been a failure so far. Even if I tried for another third and succeeded, and then got to enjoy the fruits of that success with the last third, that is only a third of my lifespan worth living, and that is not enough of a percentage to make the extended struggle worth it to me. Its easier to just call it a failed attempt and go. I am honestly kind of glad that 30 is coming up and I made that promise to myself. It gives me a pointed reason to show this is not some spontaneous emotional reaction, but a legitimate planned attempt to try and improve things that has not worked out. I honestly have thought about offing myself early, but I guess my dad would like a photo of me at my delayed graduation (because of the restrictions), as he has a photo on his wall of all his kids and stepkids, but none of me, as I have not succeeded in anything. So I guess Ill wait for his benefit? (Before anyone says, I am not close to my dad, or any of my immediate family. Hanging around for their sake is not a legitimate reason. Blood is just a viscous liquid that transports oxygen, vitamins and nutrients around the body, it does not create convenient responsibilities to other peoples lives because that blood shares a similar coded structure). At this point, Id be glad to go. I have had suicidal points in the past but they were always emotional (and I always bear through them alone, having no-one I am close to or I feel really cares for or gets me). I always would not *want* to feel that way, get scared about it, not want to die because I wished my life would be different, and have a breakdown or deafen myself with distractions or something. But now I am genuinely, legitimately out of hope to the point where I am completely numb to it and I am not even upset anymore. Life is what it is. I have no emotion. What would I be sad about? The loving relationship Id miss out on? Its obviously not happening. And what a tragedy it would be to miss scraping by on living in a shithole month to month on an unliveable salary, eh? I guess I am only posting this because I am no longer myself at all - instead of being that bubbly and childish yet worrisome and cautious overly-emotional 21 year-old baby, I am now an untalkative, slow, ill-tempered borderline alcoholic who feels nothing. Id always felt it seemed selfish to pity myself when other people have it worse and I always cared way too much about what people think, but I do not care anymore, and I feel I have earned the right to be selfish and I deserve to have people know that if everyone other normal person can get recognised, respected, valued, wanted or loved to some degree, then I at least tried.I do not expect things to change over the next 6 months, instead of trying anymore I will just spend the time daydreaming about the better life inside my head and getting affairs in order. I am interested to see and hope that I have the bravery to go through with it in 6 months, but this really does feel like a turning moment where I have accepted it. I feel all that fear from when I was 21 has gone and I have the personal skills and the hopelessness to get out of this failed excuse of a lifetime.Sorry this was so long. And hopefully this does not just automatically confirm the idea that things *never* improve for anyone. If you are young and are thinking that, things may work out differently for you - it is a possibility. They just did not for me is all. When I was 21, I made a self-pact that if nothing in life was better by age 30, Id kill myself. I turn 30 in exactly 6 months.",0
"My 3 years of high school is about to come to an end. This last year is all going to be insane studying, having almost no break / free time, teachers and people yelling and pressurizing all the time... for the purpose of taking a big exam to enter the desired university. I am screwed . How can i expect to study at a much higher effieciency and pace when i do not have the motivation and energy to do anything other than just lying at one place feeling completely awful. How can i not being yelled at without stressing out too much when the slightest form of criticism can makes me feel hurt, humiliated and question my own self-worth. I would probably fail the test. And the build up to that failure will be those ongoing stressful days that torments me every second. Sure i will struggle to put some effort in studying but it will make no difference. I think i will kill myself in process of cramming in the rush period when there is not much time left because by that time my guilt and fear for failing and being a burden to my parents as well as my hopelessness would be too intensive for me to live with. School starts about a month later, still online classes due to Covid-19.

"I do not know when it started but I found out that my father and all of my relatives in his side do not believe in mental illnesses. It was in 8th grade when I started showing signs of depression and I got into this ""rebellious"" phase, this is also where he started texting me how he will beat me and wished that I was never his daughter because I was not normal. He was not in the country at that time so he was not able to touch me. I never told my mother, I felt like nobody could not accept me and it affected my performance in school and my relationship with other people.Fast forward, at the beginning of my time as in 11th grade, I was diagnosed with depression and I even had to lie to some of the doctor's questions so that the results will not be worse. I was given a letter to see a Psychiatrist and now I am about to start college and I still never went. I still remember how my father threatened to beat me and make sure that almost all of my teeth fell off if he finds out that I have not been acting like a ""normal teenager""I had a fight with him again this quarantine and even though I am agnostic, that night I thanked God because he was not in the country and he was not able to hurt me. He kept saying that I was a mistake and an embarrassment. Everyone in the family just excused it as his ""way of saying he loves me"" because he just ""wants the best for me"" and it is just because of ""high blood that he could not control what he says""I want to run away. I hate everyone in this house. And even though that my mother is the only reason I am living, I hate her the most for letting him treat me like this. For a woman who showed me how strong she was by not relying on my father's money and embodied independence, she is the weakest person ever.Until this day, I have never heard an apology from him. Only material gifts which was his way of saying ""you cannot hate me, I bought you this expensive item""He poured his money on me while I was growing up and I hated myself for that because now I cannot even stand up alone in the outside world now without finding them and relying on their ""help""I am such a failure Parents that do not believe in mental illnesses",0

"You know when you start realizing your old bad habits like, not eating, not sleeping or oversleeping, emotionally numb, so much anger and you know it is getting bad again but you have no idea how to stop yourself so you just let it happen . At the same time, you do not let it show, as it disappoints and upsets people, so at the end of the day, you really are alone. Getting worse",0

"I do not know know if any of you do this but my mind always goes back to the past because modern times is a nightmare. I miss the old world before social media, smart phones, selfies and digital media.The late 90's and some of the early 00's is what I miss the most. Nostalgia is a doubled edged sword though because you can dream about it all you want but know you can never can go back which makes the nostalgia so damn painful it hurts my heart. it is like missing a home you can never go back to and now you are stuck in some horrible neighborhood where everything feels fake and shallow and people around you seem like aliens.

"They were so attractive to me. I loved them obsessively. It was not love, it was passionate obsessive desperate lust. I would have done anything to touch their pale pink body. I longed desperately to taste them. To tie them up, lick, and kiss their back slowly. I would make love to them. Breathe heavily I to their ear. Thrust my fingers inside them, lick and suck the juices off. The sound of their moans if pleasure sent my spiraling. I wanted to hear them cum so hard they began to cry, cough, and gag. I wanted to see their eyes roll back into their skull and watch their legs go numb from over stimulation. I wanted to force my tongue deep inside their anus and the slide it on just to lick, tease, and edge their puss for hours.I wanted every inch of them. I would have sucked their toes if they let me. it is maddening. I wanted a cock just so I could fuck them. It was the first time I understood penis envy. I would imagine myself getting hard and watching them stroke their clit and drip with desire, begging to get penetrated. Desperately widening their legs and panting like a dog breathing heavily with those sexy pink plump lips of theirs. I could barely take it. They drive me insane. I needed to touch them. To hold them. To kiss them. I felt like I would die if I could not have a single taste. I did not care if they did not love me. I did not care if they did not want me. I thought about them ever day. Every second. I still think about them. I am salivating just thinking about tasting them. The universe is without mercy. I miss those lips, above and below your belt. I feel like dying. Is it wrong to long for someone so hopelessly? I fell In love with an FBI agent",1

My dad does things to me most nights. When I reported it I went into foster care and it was so much worse. I was abused in multiple different homes and facilities.

"Ill do my best to keep this concise, but I think context is important. I am 24, and I lost my way big time.I moved back home 8 months ago, working a remote job that pays really decent money for the country I live in. Its an uninspiring job, but its fine. I do not love or hate it. I also found my passion a year and a half ago writing. It consumed me. Every bit of spare energy I have goes into it, and a lot of time. But there is big missing piece. I want to start my own family, meet someone nice and settle down. Thing is, after a 5-year relationship that started in highschool, I spent the last 3 years single, which makes for a total of 8 years since I have been on a first date. I have no idea how that works now, but I had my writing excuse. My bubble.I told myself everything can wait until I am published. Writing comes first. And for a long time, I was happy with that, and hopeful. It does not work because you are not trying, duh.Something changed a few weeks back. I realised that was an excuse more than anything, and, when the opportunity arose, I tried to flirt. Be nice, hang out. Still have no idea how this works and my confidence was at an all time low going into this, so I am not surprised I failed. But here is the kicker. After a long introspection, I realised that, for the last few years, I have been feeling inadequate. Despite having a good job, passions, and being in pretty decent shape, my life is off the script.After uni, I have finally been free to make my own choices real choices. So there is no road map, and there is no way to feel adequate when there is no rules that define it. I tried seeing this in a positive light, but all I get is more dread and fear of something. I am on a downward spiral. I have been to bad mental places before, and I can feel it coming. That choking sensation when I go to bed. The random things that make you want to cry for no apparent reason. The mental exhaustion. I am not great, headed for the bottom of the pit.there is a question in there somewhere. I do not know what it is, but I hope you have some kind of answer. If you made it this far, thank you! My bubble of ignorant hope burst",0
"What can I say..Um, after graduating college..

I will take myself out.Thanks for your time..Goodbye. Thinking of commiting suicide in the next couple weeks.",1

"Hey guys. I have basically been in a super stressful, bad situation at work- which is quite a stressful job in itself (would go into details but cannot bring myself to and also do not want to bore everybody) for the last 5 months now. I was- or thought I was- dealing with everything okay until fairly recently when I have realised I have fully moved into depression and suicidal thoughts. I cannot believe how often I have willed myself to sleep forever and never wake up- or just wish I did not have friends and family and a boyfriend I loved that I feel are preventing me ending it all. I feel so so so empty. I just want to go away for such a long time- and I have felt like this for a few months now and did not realise what this feeling actually was until now. I do not really know why I am posting other than for solidarity and to thank you for this community that I have stumbled across and am already grateful for. For all of us- I hope it gets better. This is new to me",0
Life is really not great for me and I am just a loser faggot. I have one solid friend who is pissed with me now.

My dog would be with my parents being watched and I would not need to worry. I know at some point I am going to kill myself and instead of having the I hope I live a short life optimism of my life.

"It has become clear to me we are headed towards major crises and they are going to blow up soon.Government changes in South America, the possibility of civil war and violent revolution. Losing my loved ones. Disasters from climate shenanigans. Major global powers turning more hostile.Even if we all make it out alive. The coming new governments would probably be radical and make any of the things we enjoyed, directly or indirectly, impossible to enjoy ever again.If everything is headed to shit, why even bother living right now.I wish I could just grab everyone I know and agree to just collectively end our existence as to not worry about the future anymore.

"I decided to go to therapy. The first concern the therapist had was whether or not I might be abusing my girlfriend due to being mentally ill. Not whether or not I might kill myself or how I have been doing the past week, no. Just an assumption that because I am a mentally ill man, I may be abusing the person I love. I felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed.And this was at a place that is specifically for men. I immediately asked the therapist if I could pay now. After paying, I got up and left. Never going to therapy again.Fuck this fucking society. Everyone can go fuck themselves. I hope a giant meteor hits this god forsaken planet and ends this miserable hell hole forever. I am done. I cannot stand being treated less than human any longer. Goodbye. Being a man is horrible.",1
"I have been extremely suicidal from a young age. My depression is biological, so I have had it since birth. I did not expect to live past 14, but I kept going. I did not expect to live past 16, then 18, then 21. I am almost 22 now and I feel the life being drained out of me.I never had a plan for my life. what is the point of preparing for everything when I was going to end it all anyways? You could say that I have friends and family to live for, but my only friend abandoned me and my mother is controlling and has narcissistic tendencies, and would willingly sacrifice me for her own comfort.I have no savings. I am in $2.5k credit card debt. I cannot escape my house and I do not have friends to room with. I feel like I am left with the option to end it all or sell an organ or two to make ends meet. I am so fucking miserable that even playing video games or just looking at fucking cat pictures makes me upset. Why am I goofing off when I could be working? What have I been doing with my life? Why have I spent so much time fighting?I am just so exhausted. I skipped meals for a whole day recently because I felt so guilty for wanting to spend money.

"I have been having a bad week. Friday will be the worst and hardest day no doubt. When I am feeling overwhelmed my therapist asked me to repeat to myself, ""I will make it through this okay/ alive."" It helps with my anxiety, but it brings me this sick dread now. I will make it through this alive, but I do not want to. I wish I was not suicidal everytime I spiraled",1
I decided to call out of work and take a mental day off for myself. Its been two weeks of hell for me and the one time I was supposed to go out with friends they canceled on me last minute. Even one of my closest friends is holding a grudge against me that I already apologized for and they are using it against me in any chance they can. Also making me feel like they completely hate me and never want to see me or hang out with me again. This has brought me into a spiraling depression and gave me all this unreal anxiety Being closed in a house alone is not safe for me right now with these suicidal thoughts or being at work so I decided to take myself out on something I would enjoy doing. I just hope this can help me breathe because I feel so out of my head and i feel like the world hates me.

"let us just get straight to it. My dad is an alcoholic. He has been to rehab SIX TIMES. SIX! He has been drinking even before I was born, and he continues to drink to this day. he is drunk right now. When I was 11, I was in baseball, and one day, he showed up at my baseball game completely drunk. I was so embarrassed, and really really hurt. After the game, teammates were making fun of me: ""Hey, I really like your dad. He seems fun."" ""Hey, when is your dad coming to the game next?"" ""Your dad is a real wino."" I was hurt, but, I had to go to the next game, and when I did, one of the teammates brought a can of beer, gave it to me, and said ""I know your dad will love this."" I asked my mom if we could leave. I told her I was not feeling well.I went home, and decided to quit baseball. I told my mom that it was because I was not having fun, but, in reality, I did not want to keep playing because I did not want to keep being bullied by the other kids, and being embarrassed whenever my dad showed up drunk.My dad continued to drink. About 6 years ago, my brother and I visited him for Christmas. I thought it would be nice. On Christmas Eve, he said he was going out to the store. Usually it is about a half hour walk. (He lost his drivers license due to a DWI) He came back, FIVE HOURS LATER, absolutely hammered. On Christmas Eve. I was furious. I wanted to leave, but, I did not want to ruin everyone is Christmas. So, I kept my mouth shut, and cried myself to sleep. Worst christmas I have ever had.I stopped talking to him after that. I ignored his texts, and I came up with excuses to avoid speaking to him. In September of 2019, my supervisor told me she would have to cut my hours. No reason given. I was barely making any money to live on. I could not pay my bills, and for a while, I had to park my car, and walk to work because I could not afford insurance. So, my dad decided to move in with me, and said he would pay the bills.I was really upset with this decision. I did not want him to move in with me, but, I had no other choice. Ever since then, I have had to deal with his drinking. CONSTANT DRINKING. I have screamed at him, and pleaded with him to stop drinking, and he does not listen. I have even grown to dread the sound of a can opening.About 3 months ago, my 17 year old little brother came over. My dad decided to get shit faced. He was acting like a dick, and was just being obnoxious. My brother ended up leaving, and went home. My mom texted me, and told me he came home crying. My 6 foot 7 inch tall brother, who weighs 280 lbs, cried because of my dad's behavior.On Monday, my dad decided to start drinking at 11:45 in the morning. 4 hours later, and plenty of beers later, he asked me to take him to the store. I was hesitant, but, I took him. We get inside, and already my father is embarrassing me. I go off to get what I needed, and I realized I forgot my wallet in the car. My dad pays for me, and I thanked him twice for that. I paid him back when we get back in the car, and we head home. On the way home, my dad starts acting like a dick. He starts mocking me, and going ""thanks for the money, dad."" Even though I thanked him twice. I was on edge at that point. I responded ""I already thanked you twice, you idiot."" Was it the best thing to say? No. But, I was really upset. He got upset for me calling him an idiot. We get home, and I am walking up the porch. He throws an empty bottle at my head; and that was it. I had snapped. I turned, walked down the steps, and approached my father, and punched him right in the jaw. I knocked him out. He was out for a good 3 minutes.He regained consciousness, and I helped him inside. I do not really know how to feel about it, though. I feel good for standing up for myself after dealing with a dismal father. But, I also feel terrible because he is my father. I really do not know how to process all of this. Even 2 days later. I punched my father.",0

Hi everybody. I was diagnosed with burnout/depression 8 months ago. The 4 first months I only took St-Jon's wort. Then 3 months of Lexapro up to 20mg which helped me but I was too spaced out so my psy switched me to Effexor for 3 weeks which were terrible. Then I asked for Brintellix because of the side effects profile. 1 month in and I feel not better at all.My Psy wants me to try Prozac now. Do you guys have success stories with Prozac after failure with many others ? I am starting to feel hopeless.. 4th drug.. I am loosing hope,0
"Hi, first of all I want to apologize for any mistakes I make since english is not my first language. I just wanted to share my story dealing with depression and well just write down some random things I do that have been helping me out a lot lately. I am 23 years old and my depression has affected my life in so many ways that every time I look back on the things I lost because of it I cannot help but cry, I start having suicidal thoughts and then I just feel like the thought of not belonging anywhere and seeing how my mental state has affected me and my family (Especially my Mom) is slowly killing me. I have dropped out from three different Music colleges because I could not get myself to wake up every morning, I could not believe in myself enough. I found comfort in escaping life via Videogames, Anime, any form of digital media that could allow me to zone out and stop looking at my life. I found comfort in smoking, because killing myself slowly is a great way to deal with the pain. I do not know when and why all this started, I did not realize I had spent more than a year inside my bedroom barely moving, eating or talking to people, I do not know when I became aware that I was making my mother extremely worried and her live as a single parent extremely difficult. All I knew was that seeing that suffering made me want to move I have wasted 5 years of my life, of my familys life and I have nothing to show for it but an immense guilt that fills my chest with what can only be described as a thousand knifes. This is long and boring so Ill stop, point is a month ago I was finally able to start doing things to improve, things that help me wake up every morning and feel like I can try another day. If anyone out there finds this helpful in anyway, I hope this things can help you too. I started working out every day, as hard as it was to start it is as hard if not harder to look at who I was before I started. I started learning a language and I have been studying everyday. I started playing the piano and singing again everyday. I decided to start eating healthier, to go out for walks or just sit a cafe and listen to my favorite songs. I have been trying to cut down smoking, videogames, everything and just try to do it in healthier amounts. I am still unemployed but I am planning to go to school again starting September, this time I want to graduate and finally be able to help my mom. Just do the things you love, love your body, your mind and your soul. You are not alone and you will never be. Thank you, for reading this unnecessarily long thread. Hope this can be of use to somebody out there. Lots of love to all of you. Depressed and (was) seeking help.",0

I do not want to attempt again, I cannot lose my job but is it bad that I want someone terrible to happen so I can just hide away from the world and have an excuse to feel this way.

"Recently my depression has gotten worse and yet I have not been able to tell anyone except 2 friends. I just feel like nobody cares about me except my dad , it does not feel like my mom , brother or sister really cares about me and the same goes with my friends. I feel like every time I am with someone I feel like a ghost and they just care about what I can do and my feelings are just left there untouched and damaged. And another thing is I feel like I am just going to have a shit life and what is the point of reaching the future. I just feel as if what is the point of living life to be alone , just by myself in a boring job just to make money to live a shit life. The worst part is I have anxiety and I am not sure if it relates but I could never bring myself to get help or tell my family as I am just too scared. I could never kill myself (at least at this point in my life) I just feel as if there is so much shit I cannot be arsed to deal with I just wish that someone would just make me free and either dead or just not have do deal with anything. I just wanted to get this out since I do not have the courage to get help. I feel like nobody cares about me and I do not feel like living anymore",0
At the point I am at in life I could not really care if I die in 1 hour or a few days. My life over the past month has just been getting worse and worse which fueled by alcohol do not help.

"In the last 3 weeks, I was admitted to the hospital for a week, had surgery, found out my 39yr old sister was diagnosed with Stage 3c Colon Cancer, broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years all the while having to return to work just 4 days after surgery because it was a new position. I struggled to make it through the first week but last week I had a complete melt down in front of the doctor at my clinic. I was completely honest and let her know mentally I was not in a good place, aside from what happened to me, my kids were a few states away with their dad, whom they were spending the rest of the year with and all I wanted to do was be with them with all that was going on. She booked me a flight immediately to see my kids, but there went my job. She said I needed to be with my kids. Its been a lot to swallow that a position I worked so hard to get to slipped right through my hands in a matter of minutes. I question myself and letting myself get to the point of having a melt down in public. I struggle and question myself daily. These past 5 days I have spent every last second with my kids. I play with them all day and watch them sleep during the night as if I am losing time if I am sleeping with them. Its been surreal seeing my 13yr old interact with his 4 yr old sister and 3 yr old brother. I just struggle mentally and no one really understands. Trying to find my path to healing. Trying to find my way",0

"I want to fucking die and stop existing, every single aspect of my fucking life is hurting me so bad, that I want to rip my brain out to the wall, or bite my skin off, when I think about it. Everything is boiling inside me, but I cannot find anyone to talk about it, cuz no one will understand and besides that everything is so complex that it is just fucking impossible. I am freacking lazy piece of crap that cannot force itself to work, or study, or do physical exercise. My passions and talets are non evolving, since I am so fucking lazy. Sometimes I wish that I would be born without any talets (I mean, I wish that I will not be born at all) so I would not have to deal with such mental pain and problems. I am fucking fat pig, everyone are telling me that I am not fat, but slim, but they know shit. From the past half a year I have been trying to get slimmer, but that shit are not work. Where the fuck is justice in this? How the Hell people who eat whatever they want, do not do any torture-like workouts and live happy life have the same fucking figure as Me, who is struggling everyday, to not eat any sweets and almost everyday forces Itself to painfull exercises? Where the fuck are my results? I still look like fat shit and I want to fucking die and go away from this world as quickly as possible. I will not be able to pass my next fucking year in this shitty school, cuz I am hecking lazy and I cannot study. Seriously; every single second of my life I find another thing that just pushhes me down into deep ocean of inner madness that will not came out to the outsite world. I would probably try to kill myself, but my fucking talent is stopping me in this. This is more of a curse, than blessing, because everyone are telling me that I have talent in making stories, so I know that if anywhere in the future I would actually do something about it, it could be big. But as I said, I am too fucking lazy to develop anything inside my shitty self. I have bite myself today out of inner anger and I can still see the mark on my hand. Something happened with my ankle 3 days ago, so I was not able to do any workouts, so I am just forced to see how my belly is turning more and more ugle as shit. Summer sucks let me tell, since when it is school, you are at least have something to do, you are busy with something, but now when there is like a LOT of free time, because of my laziness, every single day is constant loop of feelings of wastig time and becaming worse and worse pice of crap that I am. I cannot even find any friends, I have like 1 friend, but I am too fucking shy to talk to anyone. I am fucking alone. And even NOW I know that I am probably doing the worst thing possible, while writing this, because reddit was toxic to me everytime, so now it will probably say something like People have much worse, worse life than You, some do not have family, some are very poor, someone is health is very bad, some life in war and still you are complaining about such little things?! YOU SNOB!!! but I am writing it in such emotional storm, that I do not even care. I WANT TO DIE. I did not even knew where to post this shitty thing I have just wrote and I will probably make another mistake in my life when I post this, but I do not care. Rant for my shitty life",1
"I am not sure where to start. November of 2020, I moved across the country with my boyfriend, who four months later died of an accidental overdose. I decided to move back home after where my support system is at. Its been 4 months since he has passed away, since I have been home with my parents. I am just dealing with grief and depression. I decided to start taking Lexapro, which has helped to deal with the tremendous amount of suffering. I am 26, and I lack so much purpose. I do not have a career, I do not have a job, I am living at home, and every day I tell myself Ill do something different today and sure enough, just fall back into my same bad habits. I started smoking cigarettes which are not even my thing, and I told myself I would not drink anymore since he passed, but now I see myself start drinking a glass or two of wine a night. I am just so depressed and stuck. I want to run away to somewhere new, but I know the same problems will follow. I want to go back to school, but then I just do not even follow through. I am just so lost feeling, and I am scared to be stuck in a position for too long. I keep living in the past of the mistakes I made with my boyfriend. I know I am battling depression. I just do not know how long I can keep doing the same thing every day with zero new routine or zero purposes. I am just venting if you made it this far I appreciate you reading. Lacking so much purpose.",0
"I have always been what was considered abnormal or weird and for a long time I did not care because I did not realize what that meant and then I hit middle school and found out that weird meant getting your ass kicked and having rocks thrown at the back of your head while teachers watch and do nothing. Then getting older I began to not care again about being weird having seen people like me and then depression hit hard and I wanted to kill myself for being weird and the feeling has not gone away since and I feel like the worst part is that its all cosmetic things like the fact that I have been fat my whole life and never took care of my teeth that make me feel weird for the most part but some of its the way I think. The fact that I have never been loved by anyone other then family which I do not feel, even though I know its there I do not feel loved and feel like I do not understand love and never will because I do not want to try and get into a relationship if I am thinking of killing myself. It just feels like the saying I wish I was normal plays on repeat in my head and the only reason I am not is bad decisions and depression. I want to be Normal",1
"I am so so tired of this, after nearly 2 years of cbt they are thinking of discharging me which absolutely shatters me, not because I do not want to let go, but because I know 1.5years did little to nothing. I hate my life and these past weeks it got only worse once again, I keep crying and hitting my head, cutting nearly every night. It hurts because I am seriously realising that life probably just is not for me. I just see darkness, zero hopes not a single glimpse of a life worth living. I have still no friends and my family seriously does not care, everything looks like nothing to them, maybe I should overdose right in front of them this time. Just so they can accept that it is ok for me to go, I am basically a malfunctioning human. they would have much more money, they would not have to think about this useless piece of shit sitting at home living for free. I am not sure why I am telling a bunch of strangers all this but all I know is that I am seriously DONE if my last exam comes failed I will do more than just overdosing, it better be fatal. I tried my best to change this, I really did but its a constant set back. PLEASE I do not KNOW ANYMORE (20 F)",1
"There are days where everything is going great and then one little thing, one stupid thing brings me down. Sometimes I wonder if I should just end things and just make everything stop and just stop feeling sad, I have never felt so sad in my entire life. I feel like I have no one to turn to or talk to about anything. I just feel so empty and drained and want to give up. I want t make these feelings, this pain in my heart go away. I want to stop thinking about the person that left me but I cannot I feel like such a failure. I just want it to all stop. I do not want to feel this way anymore, I just want to forget everything. I just want it to stop, I want it to just end. I do not want to feel. I am just better off gone and not being a burden to anyone anymore no one cares about what I am going through. No one ask if I am okay. I am just easily forgotten, no one will remember me or care if I am gone. Everyday is harder",1

"I am in my 30's and in the past week, i started hitting myself. then i heated up a knife and held it against my skin until i developed a pretty severe burn. now i have a giant blistering wound on my arm. i ruin everything. i hate myself. i cannot stand this pain anymore. i cannot sleep or eat or function. I am so sick of being alone in life. I am always abandoned. even when i was a baby, i was abandoned. i have no family. i feel like i cannot keep going. I am starting to like the feeling of hurting myself. I am self harming for the first time since i was a teenager",1
"My depression got to a point where I am sick in my stomach literally every day. Its like I am sick of life, the things, my thoughts, the struggles everything.Even if I wanted to do something to get better, physically I cannot do anything because there is this constant feeling of throwing up and feeling bad.Did this happen to anyone? Could you make it better? I am physically sick from depression and I want to die",0
"Last time I was suicidal (before this time), I told myself that maybe there was someone out there who needed me. Maybe the challenges I have faced have uniquely prepared me to understand some special person. They would understand me too and we could find strength in each other. And I thought about how tragic it would be if that person killed themselves before we could make that connection. Maybe we could have had a serendipitous meeting the very next day. Its possible.As of now, I have no one to talk to. After a lifetime of being immediately shut down on the few occasions I tried to open up about how I felt, I finally have people in my life who recognize I have an actual health condition. I have a few people who want to help. Counselors and random people also seem eager to help. But they do not seem to get it. Some people seem to view me as a fragile, weak little creature they think needs to be coddled. I absolutely hate this because they have no idea about the monsters I have faced. They have no idea how hard, and how long I have fought alone in the darkness. Pushing forward through the terror with only the weakest flicker of hope to sustain me. Some people offer pity, but others think they have solutions. Like I have not already tried all that. I work out consistently. Even though I am exhausted. I have learned how to weather the hurricane of my emotions. I learned to assert myself and cut out toxic influences. I have learned how to get things done despite the heaviness. But I cannot force myself to find meaning or satisfaction in my life. I tried. I moved across the country alone several times, tried new lines of work, fresh settings. I got rid of everything and went backpacking through Mexico for 6 months. I have spent extended periods of time travelling in other countries, or backpacking through the wilderness all over the United States. I have tried to open up to people. All this in attempt to see something meaningful or worthwhile in this life. Meaning was elusive so I tried very hard to create my own. For a couple years I convinced myself Id successfully created one. My purpose was to develop a deeper understanding of nature through the study of science. Now, having just completed my degree, I am again lost for a purpose. I could create another big long-term goal, I guess. But its so exhausting to work so hard for a goal when I also have to work so hard to have a goal to begin with. When I have to work so hard to make myself care about anything. Every day is a chore. I work so hard and force myself to do things just to keep my body alive, or in the futile attempt to balance my brain. I feel like I was meant to die years ago, but death somehow forgot me. Its like I missed my stop, now I am riding a train to nowhere to the end of the line. And there is not even a view because it is night and outside there is only darkness. Maybe it would not be so bad if I found someone else on this same train. I allow myself to entertain the thought, but I have waited long enough. I have dragged this out long enough. I am ready as I will ever be. Alone on a train to nowhere",1

I get so angry and sad all of the time to the point where it does not even feel like I am me. I think about ending it sometimes just because I do not want to bring this on my friends and family. it is not me. But it is becoming me. I have had a migraine for 12hrs and I cannot sleep. It just fucking sucks. I just want to be healthy. I feel like I have a corrupted mind,0
"Can I just say how lonely I am but its a huge contradictory because I cannot get along with most people and I am terrible in relationships because of trust issues and jealousy mostly. Not only that but social anxiety kills me in just about every situation. I have been sober for over 3 years and its a good thing because I have addiction problems that spiral out of control and effect my ""work life"" like I get fired or just stop showing up. I have no friends because I do not know how to talk to people casually and the only friends I ever had were people I drank or did drugs with and now I do not do that anymore. My one and only ex cheated on me with a friend of mine and I did not even see it coming. It was a huge shock to me and I was ""in love"" with her at the time. This was like 5 years ago and I have not been with anyone since and I still think about her and ""miss"" her even tho we do not talk. I take anti depressants but they do not work I am going to and I feel suicidal 50% of the time and I do not see a bright future for me like more loneliness and working for the weekend just to do everything or nothing by myself. Hypothetically if I were to get a girlfriend it would be more work than its worth to me because of constant worry about cheating or leaving me and then being right back to where I was. I am 33 year old male with nothing to live for, looking for some sort of advice or just to be heard I am not sure. Help? If that is possible",1

"I had the courage to get a gun and just shoot myself. I feel like my life is pointless. What is the point of school, family, work, and other parts of life if we all die eventually?

"This entire year has been a montage of pain and suffering, I was basically bullied out of school until my dad pulled me out; One time when I was at this school I was given the chance to get into the school but I said no due to me being fickle and impulsive I know have no chance of getting in because I have not ""completed year 11"" correctly, I do not know how I can get into this one next year, I feel alone in this... Next year I do not know if I can get into the school I want",0

"**TW: suicide**Its currently 6am and I cannot sleep. Its 6am and have not gone to sleep yet. I am too overwhelmed too sleep.I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for diagnostic evaluation, in a couple weeks. My summer break is over a few days after my appointment and I am panicking. I am not ready to go back to school yet. I need a diagnosis before I go back, I literally cannot function, everyday of my life is living hell and I cannot take it anymore. My parents will not let me get vaccinated for covid and I do not want to go back to school where most everyone is not vaccinated. I am really worried for my appointment with the psychiatrist. I am worried that I will not be diagnosed on the first appointment and Ill have to go back to school without meds not knowing what is wrong with me.Last year, I failed most of my classes and I really do not want to retake my failed classes at irl school because I am too embarrassed to let everyone know that I am failing. My pediatrician recommended that I get a tutor and a 504. I have already have a 504 plan but my parents and I know nothing about it so its doing nothing to help me. I am too embarrassed to get a tutor because I do not want to feel stupid in front of a tutor if I do not know something.I am having a really bad time right now and I am so tired but not like sleepy tired, I am just so tired of feeling like shit everyday and not being understood. I feel like I am going crazy. I am not planning on killing myself or anything, I just wish there was nothingness. Everyday I get worse though, everyday I get more and more sick of everything and want to say fuck it. Sometimes I at least want to half-ass trying to kill myself so that people will know that I am actually suffering and they will take me seriously. Idk, thanks for listening, bye. I am not doing too good",0
"Deep down I feel like my mom sees a part of herself or someone she knows inside of me and she hates it. My mom knew how bad. I stressed and why I would have breakdowns and she wonders why I was how I was when I was younger. She found my suicide journal when I was a freshman I think it was and I lied that it was not mine. I remember she said I knew you could not have wrote this but little does she know I have always been suicidal. The first suicidal thought I had was when I was 4 I remember I fantasized about death and that lasted for a few years then things got bad and I would pray to god to help me and kill me even. I love my mom with everything I have but I know she is damaged too and its not her fault that she is the way she is, I do not blame her. If I was in her shoes I would have gave up on myself.

"""I m sick and tired on how my life's going"",i know it sound so cliche but that how I being truly feeling recently,I feel like everyday my life's going downhill. it is been like a month since I have been feeling like this. I WAS not this type of a guy . I do not feel like working out which I used to love doing for like 4-5 times a week. I have been eating less and less everyday, I got a lot of assignment and studying pending too but I just cannot do it. I only get motivation to work for max an hour or two only when the work is really important otherwise I spend most of my day laying in my bed I just do not like how everything is going recently, I just want my motivation back, so that I get back to my normal life back I want my motivation back",0
"I am ready to live again and be happy. I have been rolling with the punches and talking out my problems, but how do I know its not just the drugs. Drink makes me happy so how do I know its not that.

"I used to have so many things I wanted to do when I got older but now all I want to do is die. I cannot go to college. I barely even passed my classes this year, and the only reason I did is because my teachers excused a bunch of assignments because I was in a psych ward for a while. I cannot do anything. I want to just live in an apartment the size of a bathroom and cook my food on a plug-in stove or something and sleep on a mattress on the floor. Like genuinely that is my ideal life. But I need a job to do that. And idk if I can get an apartment like that anyway. I just wish someone would fucking kill me so I do not have to do it myself. For a little bit I thought maybe I could be a monk but then I remembered I do not have the fucking dedication for that. I am an all or nothing kind of guy so I figure Ill either get my shit together or just decide to not even try and throw my life away.

But if I do not try |one more time| then Id have nothing left keeping me here. I am out of reasons to keep me here. I feel like I am caped in this hollow body of a girl I used to remember. Every time I look in the mirror, I am reminded just how broken I am. I see her face and remember how happy she used to be. I remember how full of life she was. She was a ray of light and sunshine, and I am reminded how dark and empty her eyes now are. Her sleepless nights are leaving their trail under her eyes. The loss of appetite has diminished her wardrobe, all the clothes she used to love to wear- now fall off her body. I am reminded she is empty and the walls are caving in. The walls in this body get smaller and smaller I cannot breath, I feel like I am suffocating and no one even understands. I am right here dying slowly and you cannot even see.

"I am a 27m, Pansexual, and Autistic. Growing up, I was bullied alot, but I can recall having happy moments, even happy moments with my mother, but as I grew, my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile, and drastically effected my mental standing. Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness, and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime, and it helped me ignore it, but then came the Dark Day, an argument so drastic, that I had to kick myself out, to my wife's (girlfriend then) house. For awhile, I felt great! My mother's hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and leaving finally made it disappear. Come Present day, my anxiety had risen, things are harder to enjoy, and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screw-ups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife (who battles against depression, and is possibly autistic). I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind, and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up. This has spiraled into beast that just will not die. I do not know what to do, and I have come here as a start, because idea how to ask for help, and have actively avoided looking for help because I am too ashamed The Root of a Losing War",0

"I have got a medical condition and a birth defect, and its almost untreatable. i live on one functioning kidney, however that kidney is getting worse by the years. i have severe anxiety and depression, and i do not see a future in myself, I am only living to occupy someone is boredom or loneliness as of today. my life span is cut down by 20-30 years in average, or my kidney could overload as it is taking the load of one more kidney (keep in mind i have high blood pressure from my anxiety and my kidneys itself), or eventually i could kill myself. i struggle to make friends but slowly and surely I am trying to reunite with my old friends who i tampered with and decided to push them away because i thought it would help me, instead it left me a massive debt from loneliness. I am not sure if i will get a job, if i do its probably to pay back my parents as they spent a bit over a million at birth to practically save me, and take care of my only true friend and someone i love deeply, enough to supply them for a happy life. if not, I am not sure if i would just like to enjoy my life, knowing the end is very near. I am a person that loves attention and the idea of love in general, i would love a wife and kids one day but it horrified me when i thought of what would happen after i left. anyways, thanks for reading another rant, have a good day/night, take care I am dying away",0

I cry almost everyday at the thought of my kids growing up without me but I feel like nothing would change if I left this world.I am not really looking for help just a place to finally be able to say these words without criticism.

I have been a wreck since then. Almost everything in my life reminds me of them. I miss them unbearably and do not know how to cope. I have been crying throughout the days and I just do not want to do anything other than either cry or hug my cats somehow. They were my closest companions in the lonely post pandemic world. I cannot even fully express my feelings to anyone in real life because they will all make fun of me. I am in so much pain right now, worried sick about my cats who keep crying for me, I have been told. This is terrible. Being forced to leave my cats has triggered a downward mental health spiral",0
"I have to deal with chronic pain and sometimes I use drugs for pain relief. I am already sad I have chronic pain but after I get high and come down I feel flat, emotionless and it is just an uncomfortable numbness. I have been valuing my sobriety lately, the antidepressants seem to help with that. I can quit drugs but I would have to find other ways to cope with chronic pain. I have been taking the middle road and just smoking weed about twice a week, drinking lots of coffee daily, and finding other ways to cope with pain. Looking forward to getting high and alleviating pain and depression for a day gives me a goal and a reward but now it is increased the uncomfortable numbness. Now I am just drinking coffee to avoid caffeine withdrawals and it does not boost my mood like it used to. I just want a healthy relationship with drugs, I need something better than abstinence or addiction and I just have not found it yet. Life seems to be telling me it is one or the other.

I do not want to make my family sad, I do not want my friends to talk about me like the elephant in the room, I do not want my pets to be alone. But my will to live is completely gone at this point. I walk down the street without looking hoping a car will just finish me and pray for an accidental death. Something that will not label me as a suicide but I am not so lucky. Nothing specifically happened, I am just tired of feeling like this. It feels like I have been drowning for the last 15+ years and am just now realizing that I drowned a long time ago. But I worry what will happen when I die. My sister has struggled with depression and suicidality for years and I have been her support. I worry that she will take her own life if I do. My mother has always been on the more delicate side and has admitted to me that she never fully recovered from my sisters past suicide attempts. I am not sure she will recover if I die. The list goes on. I have become an important support network for many and its left me with no one to talk to. Its like I am being held hostage by the people around me and I feel so stuck.

"it is been two weeks since I have been out of the hospital. I feel fantastic. I was hiding my feelings. I am a transgender man and I was not supported by my parents, but they finally educated themselves. And they respect me. I stood at the edge and I ran towards it, but I stopped. I thought, ""that is a steep drop. What if I fall? What if I fall and it lasts too long and I scream and what about the anticipation of waiting to die and *what if I do not actually ascend?*"" I sat down and called the cops. I spent 6 days in the hospital in the psych ward and I have been more open to myself about my feelings. I also realize that for me, suicide will not work because I will have to do all of this over again and that does not sound fun. They put me back on antidepressants, and ones that work real well. I feel fantastic. They worked like a charm.

But until now, I did not get a job, and I am struggling to build myself as a freelancer. I have so many regrets on my teenage years because I did not have experience some fun. So, I keep on comparing myself to other people on their success, good social life, career growth, and relationship; and I am not grateful because I always experience struggles.As I grow older, I always telling myself if I am still worthy, because I do not have anything to prove myself to people. I feel weird because most of the people who I interacted did not like me. I do not have much stories to tell, I do not have such experience in life. I love being an introvert, but I like to interact with people, I just do not know how to handle it.I do not want to live anymore. I am worthless. I have many regrets in life, and I feel late. I feel worthless, I deserve to kill myself.",1
"my baseline productivity fluctuates and has been often on the lower side although sticking to what I have been advised and following a routine has made my ""life"" better in the sense that I have a routine, there is less of procastrination, ironically, it has also makes me feel more in a vegetative state. Waking up / physical activity / adequate sleep etc might make one ""live"" a better life, but what is the point of just living a better life iykwim, I would rather be in a moderately deranged state, feel more things, react to more things, manifest and do what external stimuli make me do than just being normal and vegetative. Fixing / adhering to a schedule, obeying conclusions derived in counselling do not really imply ""doing"" better",0
"I am going to be 30 in a few months and I have struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was about 13. No matter what I do whether it be work out, eat healthy, take my meds, do my job, have relationships, etc I always end up back in the same place. My bf and I have been going through a rough patch and I am pretty sure he wants me to leave him alone so he can move on. I told him I am having suicidal thoughts not as a way of manipulating him just trying to communicate what I am going through and he made me feel so terrible. I am already ashamed for feeling this way and he said he does not know what I want him to do with this information. I feel so alone and lost. what is the point in life anymore. I feel so ashamed",1
The only thing keeping me here is the guilt of how much Id hurt my family if I killed myself. Its so painful to be alive. I hate my life but my parents would not be able to move on if I killed my self. Without them there is no reason for me to stay here. I just want to know what to say to have them forgive me and move on with their lives after I am gone. I am searching for a reason to stay other than guilt. I have put them through so much. I am only alive for other people,0

"here is my brief story :During my childhood I was very discret and I did not have a lot of friands. Until 13 girls never talked to me because I was not the cool guy who ran fast, I was rather the quiet kid. During middle school I had some friends but no girls seemed to like me. So I convince myself girls should not like me. Probably because I am ugly. But in first year of high school, I fell in love for a girl. And after 1 year, she and I started a relationship. I was really really happy, but 2 months after, she left me for no reason. And this is the beginning of my depression. During the first months, I have never gone outside my house, I have tried killing myself twice. I was totally depressed, I did not want to live anymore. A part of me has disappeared, and I have not found it yet. After 18 months, I feel better, but something is not the same since. I have no more self confidence. The self confidence I gained during my relationship disappears 2 months later. Now I am sure people cannot like me. But here is the problem. I really like a girl, but I know she is way out of my league. And I think she will reject me so I do not try anything. I do not know how. So I think I will be lonely forever, because I am too afraid. I think I will be lonely until the end",0

I preferred to be a fighter in life and never ready accept that I may be mentally sick. But it is a very very terrifying feeling to have panic attack. After it settles down, usually during the day, I have shaking muscles in thighs, feels no control on legs. Very very foggy and loaded brain. Red burning eyes and the feeling which killed me, I was not to share and explain what is happening with me. Life kept on demanding what is usually did. Used to cry during nights, always felt, death can be a less painful option. It will end all the misery.

"In the past six months, I went through a break up with the only person I ever let in and truly loved, had a mentally ill family member threaten to shoot me, had repressed memories of molestation and abuse work there way out in counseling, lost my home during the break up, bought a 5th wheel i cannot register because of a title dispute from three owners ago, found out my father who was barely there is not actually my father, and so much more. The last month I have been living in my truck with my two dogs, and having suicidal urges and thoughts multiple times a day. It seems like everytime i think I am at the bottom something comes along to kick me in my teeth like a passed of redneck wearing steel toes. I feel fucked, completely fucked. I work all day, play with the dogs, and pass out only to do it all over again. I do not know how to get out of this, and housing and rental prices are soaring, nearly impossible to find one on my construction paychecks right now. I do not know what to do, I am holding onto a vague plan, and a hope that if I just keep working something will eventually get better, but it has not. I feel fucked, beyond fucked, and one of these days I reckon I will give in, and just tie that noose, and hope it happens quick. I have no family, and most my friends are on another continent, I do not know why I chose to post this, I guess I would at least like to be heard by someone other than my two pups.

"Hello, I am 30 and I do not have a life nor prospects for a career. I was depressed due to abusive parents and the great recession. Then I failed to find a job that would allow me to support myself after I graduated college at 21. I coasted for a year doing odd jobs and several vacations. Soon afterwards I became severely depressed and went catatonic until recently. that is just the background. I was a top 20% student coming out of high school (despite already being depressed.) Although due to self harm as a teenager I have a bad back and knees so cannot do anything where I need to stand or work with my hands. As my mental health continued to decline I had to switch to a humanities major and graduated with a 3.6 GPA. Those circumstances combined with mental health issues leads to where I am at today. I actually spent the pandemic trying to go back to school studying computer science, but I am unable to retain any information. I ended up with a 3.2 GPA and I was only taking 2 courses per semester at a relatively easy school.I was and am an attractive person so I had no trouble getting laid while on vacation several years back. My appearance is not the issue, I look almost the same, I have severe mental health issues that prevent me from having log term relationships with anyone let alone a romantic partner. I am not an incel per say, but not having a social life has had a huge impact on my mental health. (I strongly suggest to most depressed high school students --whose main source of depression is parental/social-- to do whatever it takes to move out after high school.)At this point I am extremely insecure, have no self esteem nor self confidence, I am broke and have no friends. I am being evicted me and so after failing to secure gainful employment this summer have decide the objective choice is suicide. I know I am a complete failure, but I do not believe in myself so I have opened the floor to your input. 30 with no life experience or prospects.",1
"I am 21 now but when I was a teenager starting 18 and below I was always hurt and confused that women would reject me every time for dates. I never understood why, I thought my personality was not good enough for women to like me backTurns out I was really ugly and did not know it, bad clothing, terrible haircut, cystic acne, skeletor skinny. Since I was 18 I have been working on myself to hit the gym and get muscular, went on accutane so no more acne, better haircut, better style, etc. I went from. 2-3/10 to a 8-9/10 Suddenly so much girls are interested in me, people actually want to be my friend now, everyone thinks I am more confident, like-able, less awkward, etc. than I once was years ago Everything just feels empty and superficial. If anything I am a worse person than I was 3 years ago, I feel like looks are the most important thing in life and how people perceive you, and seeing how people treat me now has changed my worldview, and it has shattered me mentally.

"I have always struggled with depression. Started freshman year of high school (2010) and its been getting worse ever since. Some months are perfecting fine, but when a wave of it would hit and I am crying myself to sleep or just staring at my phone. 11 years of this and the only reason I am still going is because of my dog. Only a few more years....I saw a ""it is get better post"" on Facebook when I was in high school. This women made a post talking about how she struggled in high school but now she is 25 and happy with a family. Well, I am 26, and I have no family. Just my dog. Originally thought it was my best friend and her family but after living them with 2 years, I realized I am at the bottom of the totem pole. ""If everyone is the problem maybe it is you."" I have had friends, but none tend to stay long. If I am not going to school or working with my friends then they are not my friends. For whatever reason when I leave a place those friends do not want to hang out anymore. Graduated High school? Those friends I do not talk to (though I see them post all the time on Snapchat together) My friends at my pervious job I now long talk to. (again see them post on snap together). I am going to be leaving my current job in a few weeks and I know it will be rinse and repeat. Again... is it me?I just want to know when it does get better? Because I do not know how much longer I have in me. When does it get better?",0
"Today, i have come to the sea side for my sister's wedding. There was a lighthouse at the furthest part of the bay. I just felt i have to go there everytime. For five days, I went to the lighthouse and thought just thought. We were preparing for a wedding but i was depressed and feeling lonely for a reason. Today's visit was pretty harsh with too much wild thoughts. Eventually i found why i was sticked to that lighthouse. Two years ago, I was at my highschool graduation party. Whole class whom are graduating was only 50 to 60 people and so everybody knows each other. After the party has come to slow music for dancing, i was just shy as f*ck to dance. For other impacts on me , i was actually the first one on exams and everybody knew me for a reason so, i was not the guy nobody cared but the one who was cared. Anyway, i was there standing some people trying to raise me to dance but i am rejecting for some fckng religious reasons. I got my seat next to my friend who also did not come up to dance. The neat part is here which is still I hate myself. For the 4 years and some before the girl i loved was there just sitting maybe hoping for a dance. But nobody did not tell her. Maybe this was the chance for a last moment i would see and maybe know her but i could not. FOR FCKNG REASONS! i could not do it. I was shy and idiot. I knew that this love was not just a simple thing but to write poets and think always. Maybe it is creepy for 4 years i did this. But as i said, some religious things blocked me. Also, i was preparing for University exam and i was scaring that what if i cannot succeed in the exam for this love. I had pressed my feelings deep inside but they have never gone. That day was the most crashing moment for me to remind me why i am a failure and idiot. Today, because i am in my sister's wedding, people are going to watch me and of course i have to raise someone to dance. And my cousin who looked liked with her face and hairs just like my love. I am not pervert and i know she is my cousin but my love has never passed away and i still remember her.So i will raise her to dance today and i will cry as fck inside for that old day. Well, this seems simple for some people here but that lighthouse and sitting there alone watching the sea reminded me that I have succeeded in the exam but this life i have put my everything is not what i can go for a life span. I do not know how to enjoy life. I have wasted my 4 years and only thing defines my life is my successful exam. Everybody knows me because of my University. I am disappeared behind my success. And this is my fault. Not raising my love to dance is my fault. Wasting my life for chasing money is my fault. I was just looking the sea to jump in and never swim up. I am living in a body not doing what i wanted but only chasing money and career. Two hours ago, I had a choice to make. I could jump in and disappearing from this world for good. But i had another chance to change my life maybe. Maybe I cannot say this was a desicion because I do not want to ruin my sister's wedding. It would be pretty selfish. Anyway I decided to not wait or hesitate myself to do anything. I chose what my life should be. If you have read this whole, thank you. Now maybe, you can talk to your loved ones. Just go and ignore anything. Not doing this, will ruin your life for a long time. A Decent Reminder",1

They adore me and I absolutely love them. Other than what happened my life is alright for the most part, could always be better but I cannot complain. I know a lot of people have it worse and I always try to stay positive. But this is just killing me, and when my wife or her family finds out about this is going to get really ugly. I often find myself thinking it will be really nice to just not wake up. I feel like that is a bit selfish but its just how I feel. My family would get a nice life insurance policy and it would settle the funds I lost. Again I know other people have it worse and I am sorry I feel bad for even coming her and venting like this. But its getting scary for me where I am getting more and more depressed and thinking some dark thing. do not know what to do.",0

People must think I am some weak and miserable idiot and are all angry and hate me. I do my best to stay on good terms with others but its only myself i am fooling by thinking it will get better for me just because other people have it better. When my whole life its just been deteriorating and it will not get better.

Every time I thought I was taking the much needed mental health break but in reality I just made things worse. I just give myself more time to get in my head and give myself something else to worry about. I distanced myself from my family. My mother moved away from where I live a few years ago and now I live completely alone. I chose not to go with her so I could avoid her constantly pressuring me to do things I do not want to do. Because I thought I was special and I though I could always make things work out the way I want. I have refused any sort of legitimate help like medication when I really had the chance to get it. I had health insurance and my mother was paying for my therapy and I got diagnosed with Bipolar Depression. Right when I was about to get medication I stopped going and lied to my mother the whole way, wasting her money, time, and hope for me.I do not know what the next step in my life is, its so hard to remain positive when I know Ill just fuck things up myself.I do not have anybody to go to so I am just going to put it out on here before I finally get the ambition to shoot myself.

"I have been playing video games all my life, and they have been a staple hobby for me. At some point along the road of mental illness, I think they stopped being mainly a hobby and turned into a coping mechanism. it is one thing to be bored of a hobby, but it is a completely different thing to be bored of a coping mechanism. It feels like such a struggle to feel happy playing games now, and when I actually manage to enjoy my time, it is never long. As I have grown up, I have developed very specific preferences for the way I play my games, if I cannot fulfill those preferences, it is value as a coping mechanism is void. The longest a single game has lasted for me in the past 4-5 years has been 3 weeks before I lost all interest and began a desperate search for my next game to play. When you have been going through this cycle for a while, you run out of games to hop to; and you run out of ways to cope. I do not know what I have to change, I wish my preferences for these games would just go away, I do not know if it is maybe some form of OCD or just some strange side-effect of depression fucking with the pleasure center of my brain. I do not want videogames to be a coping mechanism anymore, I do not want to have to cope. it is gotten much worse recently, games are only lasting a couple days max and I am losing motivation to even search for more. I just cannot stand to deal with this anymore. it is so hard to enjoy things now",0
"Hi everybody, excuse my english but its not my first language, I hope to be clear.Tw: self harmMy (19f) little sister (15) is living a pretty bad moment in her life, her relationship with our father is complicated and she does not have friends to talk to.Our parents separated 4 years ago and she says it did not bother her but I know it is not true, I also had mental health issues due to the separations and I see a therapist to deal with them. My mom is always kind but she does not get this type of things, like anxiety and depression, so my sister does not open you to her. My dad is a literal narcissist and shouts and says mean things at every mistake we make, I learnt growing up not to get offended or considerate his insults, but I know how much it hurts to be called an idiot and a delusion from someone who is supposed to make you feel home.I am the only one who my sister opens up to, but I do not know how to help her.One month ago we found out she cuts herself and dad got angry at her, i talked to her and i reassured her but i do not know what to do. She said it was the first time, I know it is not true but I did not say anything that could make her feel wrong of bad. I always talk to her and I listen, but she says she does not know how to feel, she feels numb and cannot sleep. Sometimes she is more chill and sometimes she is very mean to me. When she treats me badly I get angry, I know I should maybe be more patient but she can be very mean.If you can give me some advice, thank you so much. My sister is depressed how can I help",0
I do not understand how I have trouble with my depression when things have been going well for me. I started a great job and got into grad school but feel useless and hopeless. My family keeps asking me whatbis wrong and gets annoyed when I tell them honestly that I have no idea. I just want to shut out the world and be alone in that familar silence. I hate myself for feeling this way.,0
"Really, what is the point of life? I keep being in a rollercoaster of sadness, joy, anger and i just keep hurting the people around me. I really just want to vanish, disappear from everyone is life and not be a burden anymore. Why is ceasing our own life so bad? Its my decision, for MY life to end the way i want it too. Its not selfish, I am just tired of suffering every single day. what is the point?",1
"i want to be okay, why is nothing working i want to be happy",1
"I am so tired of having to deal with depression. Sometimes things get good but it always goes back to shit. I want to die. I just think that it is my destiny/fate to commit suicide. I do not see a future for me. And as much as I want to do some good in this world, I am just so damn tired of fighting these battles in my head. I am tired",1
"I am starting my junior year of high school this year and I am not really too excited about it. my freshman year was pure fucking hell!! my sophomore year was alright though because of COVID and had to do online classes..for 3/4 of my freshman year the anxiety was too unbearable that I skipped class and went straight to the bathroom for all 8 periods. my anxiety is like this my heart starts beating fast, I cannot walk straight, my eyes start to get droopy, etc, I asked my mom and dad if I can do homeschooling but they declined FUCK. I only have like 1 month left until school starts and I am really considering suicide, I have been thinking about suicide everyday for a couple of months now, nobody in my family knows that I have a big anxiety disorder thing and I am depressed out of my fucking mind, because of this fucking anxiety thing god gave me..because of this thing god gave me I have forgotten all my skills and all the things that made me unique, I am just nothing, if I am planning do commit suicide I would want a slow death like bleeding myself out. I would also love someone to beat the shit out of me until I am dead but nobody would want to do that to me. this is only a small percent of what I experience. my emotions are not reaI, I have fake emotions, it feels like god is playing with my fucking mind, I just want to have real emotions, but depression and anxiety are the 2 only really emotions I can feel school :(",1
"every day my family demands more from me.every day things I like are taken away from me.I am not worth having good things or happiness anyway.If I find comfort in something, i immediately need to be reminded that it is a loan given by someone else.Nothing I have is my own.Everything can and will be taken away from me.I cannot afford and do not deserve any of the good things in my life.The good things should be taken away from me.The only way to continue to the next day is to tear myself apart.I want to die so bad every day I get more exhausted",1
"Today was the last straw. I had enough mental abuse from my nparents. I could not take the mental anguish anymore, so when the time was right, I decided to take all my things and leave. My plan was just to keep going north till I get to South Carolina, but now I am just really scared. Scared that my parents and relatives will find me. In fact I have had a few panic attacks while I was driving. I sorta give up at this point I just do not know what to do with anything anymore. Right now I am at fucking gas station in a different county and I feel very paranoid. I hate how I cannot just have good people in my life who will not find some way to abuse me. I do not understand how people do this (running away). Do they not get caught ? I do not know. I have never felt more paranoid and scared in my life. If I go back, it will be 1000 times more mental abuse than I received before. I am going to find a way to kms soon, because now all I feel is great pain. Who ever said LiFe Is A gIfT is a fucking moron ! I ran away from home",0
"I have been dealing with ideation for a long, long time but I know there was always part of me that very much so did NOT want to die. Lately that will to live has just been slowly swallowed by dread and hopelessness, I do not trust myself alone but have absolutely no one to turn to. No friends, no family, no one.I spent the night miserable and unable to sleep. All I could do is stare at the closet, where I know there is a gun, I know it could be so quick. I just dread the thought of someone having to clean up my mess of a body. I guess my best bet is to find somewhere secluded and hope I do not bother anyone.I thought maybe typing this all out would give me some sort of relief or catharsis, but its honestly just reinforcing how hopeless I feel. I just hope that maybe, in another life, I could have found help, or did things differently, and it would not have to be like this. I am so scared to be alone",1
"I do not want to fail again, all I have done since I have been alive is fail or fuck up I am just tired and I want to end it all I do not even care if it hurts anymore I just want to be gone I do not sleep I feel nauseous when I see food I hate my body and my self more than ever, I do not feel like anyone cares the only thing that makes my life feel like I need to stay longer is my first child is on the way but my partner just does not care about how I feel or how I am feeling about my life our life, she just tells me to go back to my family who let me go homeless until I met her. I do not want to make anybody disappointed in me but I do not think Ill do anything worth being alive for I cannot do anything anymore I do not want therapy or meds I did that and it just made it hard to move I still have thoughts of hurting myself and rotting I am so sad and tired I do not want to be me anymore I cannot keep feeling feelings I do not want to be here but if I die Ill still make everyone disappointed I do not care what people are going to tell me I just cannot keep bottling up I am so close to hurting myself and ending it I am tired and overwhelmed but no one cares I want to be dead. I want to boil. I am so tired of seeing my face hearing myself breathing I hate eating I hate food I hate everything I want to be dead i hate people. I hate life I do not want to but I do not want to be alive anymore",1
"I am writing this not knowing if I will ever actually send it; I do not know why I get so anxious when I think of you or make an attempt to reach out. All my thoughts disappear and the only thing I experience is this weird, warm sensation in my chest: there is nothing but a feeling of faintness, like my insides are slowly evaporating. Images flash of what I think your life is like today and I also see memories of other times we have been together. These latter are mostly from moments all our families have been together, I mean the families you have joined with in marriage and our own blood relations. My reflections of the weddings (that I know I was at in the flesh) I experience in the same manner as I envision how your current life is like, as if I am a passive observer, as if I am dead or a ghost. I saw a picture of me at your wedding and I remember feeling so out of place in that world, I recall it now as if I were never there, disconnected and a complete stranger. Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever see you again, I imagine our lives forever separated as if that were the answer but it does not really seem any different than its ever been even when I did appear at various holidays and family gatherings.My life today is just a meager attempt to scrape buy, do the bare minimum just to keep living for what? I do not know. I work by myself and mostly just sit in my truck and read when I should be working. I do not really care. I can get away with it so I do it. I would not say I am depressed, I can get by most of the time without ever having a sad thought: most of my life these days is characterized by indifference. I think about trying to change my life in some way but mostly nothing comes of it, I do not really care. I am just another life amoung millions of others doomed to die in obscurity. Sometimes I see myself as having potential to do great things but then I take revenge on this cruel world by becoming a martyr who will die with this potentiality in my grave. At times I wish I had been born thousands of years ago instead of today. This modern world is grotesque and foreign to me, the paths in life we are limited to tread are dehumanizing. Sure, many people make their own path but I lack the strength and imagination. I do still dream of the perfect life. For me it would be a life of endless travel. There are so many places in the world I would love to visit. But then again I know I am doomed to live my days out in this miserable country, in this pathetic world of an era that cannot even give us the satisfaction of failing so we can create something better. No. I am afraid man is doomed to stagnate forever in the filth of democracy and freedom, mere titles and images while the few toxic hands of corruption really &lt;i&gt;live&lt;i&gt; on the backs of the bodies that suffer in the transcendence of eternal hope.I am rambling but my point is this world is lost to me. I do not have any hope, and without anything to believe in a man cannot be said to exist. I suppose this is why I experience your presence, current and past, as a ghost or as if I have never existed all along and this life is only a dream with my body a mere paroxysm of nerves whose only force is born in the desire to exist.Looking at these words I probably will not send this message. But this is the gulf I so desperately want to bridge but I know my breath is lost in that void so sending it is still the same as not. If I am practically dead already why not make it official? I can never send you these words; how could I? My life is so diametrically opposed to yours. I am afraid I am doomed to live like this. I am deathly afraid. I have no place here. A message to the void",0
"[a vent, I suppose] My age range is 18-25. I am still 'young'. I was always a person who felt young at heart even 3 years into depression because I liked childish things like cartoons and toys and sweets. But something happened last year and I stopped feeling that way and lost love for those things. Now, I feel no longer like a young person but old and tired. I am tired all the time and fed up with the world. I want to disengage from it; already isolated myself from most my friends. Before I felt isolated from my age group because I was too childish, but now I feel isolated because I feel too old for /all this/. I feel like my life is nearing its end and I do not want to go on. I just go day to day without doing much at all because things do not excite me like they used to. Sometimes I look in the mirror and check if I am growing wrinkles or white hair because I wonder if my outside will reflect my inside. Why do I feel old? Did something happen to my psychology? Before I felt like a sad child inside but now I feel like an old man waiting to die. Why did I miss the middle stage of growing up? I know happy old people exist, but I just feel done: pessimistic and tired. Still 'young' but feel 'old'",0

"I know having suicidal thoughts is a hallmark symptom of clinical depression, but does anyone get these thoughts very intensely? its like the thoughts are not even my own. When I am feeling low, Ill just get these very abrupt, extreme suicidal thoughts that almost feel like strong urges. I would never do that but they are freaking me out. Extreme, intrusive suicidal thoughts?",0
"Please do not blame me or anyone else. In fact, I was unbelievably lucky to make it this far. My parents are and always were caring. My brother and sister have always wanted the best for me. I just have a malfunctioning brain that makes me unhappy all the time. Even when I am happy, it means that I am about to do something terribly irresponsible and stupid that will hurt those close to me. The best thing I can do for everyone involved is to bow out now. To those who say this is a selfish move, you will be over it in a couple of weeks, but you would rather condemn me to a lifetime of misery. Id just like to send a big Fuck you to those guys ;)In case you are interested, I am still in love with Tessa from high school, and a girl called Bara who I met at a drumming circle this summer. AnonymousPS to my daughters Abbey &amp; Zoey: I can never do this because of you. I love you too much and do not want you to feel like this would be your fault. Of course its not, but people tend to blame themselves. So I guess I am sticking around. I love you Abs &lt;3 &amp; Zo &lt;3 I decided to (not) end my life today.",1
"I thought that going to a good school, making money, and finding some friends would be good. It has not been that great. I am working on stuff that I think is important. I do not work for assholes anymore--I work for myself. I do not have much trouble getting dates. I am not that worried about money. I do not have a great relationship with my family, but we can talk sometimes. They mostly avoid my texts and calls, because I am pretentious and I do not hold my tongue enough. I do not laugh at their jokes. I do not say stuff you are supposed to say. I only do that kind of thing when I am working. The country stresses me out. I have thought maybe leaving would make things better, but I doubt it. I moved to a new part of my country where things are chill. Now I am just alone with beautiful weather and people who constantly wave and say 'hi' when I am walking down the street. It was nice at first, but I do not have anything in common with these people. They compliment me on being traveled and smart, and it inevitably turns into a one sided conversation. Compliments make me uncomfortable, and I mostly like to talk about ideas--science, politics, business, art, whatever. I am not a narcissist. I would rather be invisible. Buying a big house, having more sex, whatever, I do not think much of it would matter. I do not trust anyone or have access to real intimacy. I have had a lot of manipulation from family, business partners, former friends. I am scared of something I say becoming a news story one day. I am scared of lawsuits from friends. I feel like if I could tap into the naivete and innocence of my youth, it would be good. How though... I think about the reality of the world: guns, lies, cash, fucking hedonism. I cannot tell if I am angry or depressed. I think I am weirdly neither. I cannot describe what I am feeling. I know it is just neurobiology that leads to this kind of shittiness, but I am not going to some doc and pouring out my feelings. I do not trust anyone not to write a fucking book one day. I have had uncomfortable situations play out in the past. Success means nothing to neurobiology",1
Living life on this Earth is a curse.I am so tired of reaching out to get help. Why are people telling me to get help? I do not think I want to anymore. I do not see the point in forcing myself to want to live. I am just so tired. I just want to cease existing. I wish I just never existed.,1
"I do not know why I am still here, just to suffer. I spend almost all my time at a job I hate but that I cannot quit. And whenever I have free time I am sitting alone in my tiny apartment watching yt videos or play pn my switch. I lost contact with the few friends I had left. I never had any sort of intimate reltionship whatsoever. I am terribly lonely. And the worst part is that I have become so lonely that I became bitter and I developped a lot of hate towards people. I think I prefer to remain alone now. So what is the meaning of this? Why do I work so hard at a job I hate if I do not even have a decent life outside of work? I tried to apply dr. Peterson's advice, but I cannot find any meaning to my life. I cannot find something to aim at. I have no clue what is supposed to be meaningful, so I prefer what is expedient. I will not be able to endure much longer. A few more years of this and I will have to end it all. Meaningless and aimless life",0
"Last night I had nightmares about my girlfriend cheating on me. This is the first time this has ever happened. we are in a loving relationship and the sex is great. she is honestly the best thing in my life. The only ray of light in my hell hole of a life. I guess my subconscious thinks I should question even her because nothing In my life has ever worked out.Its no exaggeration to say that our house looks as bad as the house in fight club. The chimney has cracks going all up the sides. the bathroom is covered in mold that comes back every time you bleach the surfaces. The cabinets in the kitchen are dyed with a thick layer of tobacco tar; if we boil water, the condensation drips down the doors and leaves streaks. We scrubbed them for a whole day but it only got some of it. The carpet is stained yellow from my aunt's cat living alone in there for a few months after she died and my cousin would not come get her. Before moving in we rug doctored it and although the water was black when we were done, it is still a smelly disgusting living room. There is no insulation, in fact in some parts of the wall near the doors and windows you can see to the outside. Our power bill is about 270 dollars a month thanks to that. For the last two years I have been living in squaller because my parents found it convenient. My grandmother lives next door you see. And she has congestive heart failure. So it is best to have someone there. I love my grandmother so I do not mind but it does become a lot sometimes. More than I can balance with a job. My commute is an hour and the pay is garbage but I was just fired from my other job where I was a manager. I was manager for a month before a disgruntled employee who did not get that position threatened to sue the company for racism since I am white and she was black. My boss told me not to worry about it and then a week later ""offered an opportunity"" for me to step down. When I refused, I got the axe. To make matters worse I cannot trust my family to help me. In fact I hate them. My father beat the shit out of me when I was a kid, he even used a 2x4 on me once. My mom used that to manipulate me to do whatever she wanted because ""she was on my side"" and when I broke that off it became if I say no it means I am a bad person. Because she would only ask for things that SEEMED like they were in the best interest of others but just by coincidence she got exactly what she wanted out of the deal too.I have had conversations with them both before but they just do not register what the problem is. I can spell it out for them but nothing ever changes. I am 26 years old and my parents still control everything and every time I try to shake them, they use their financial leverage to shackle me back up. Every time I get a job that pays well to start saving up, I get dozens of calls a day about how my grandmother needs this or that or my sister's need something all of a sudden or she will call something on one of my accounts and if I do not do this very time consuming task I will lose my money or some shit like that. But then if I do not have a job, I get the same treatment trying to force some shitty 10 dollar an hour bullshit retail job on me. And that is where I am at. If this is all life has to offer, I do not want any part of it anymore. My life is not worth living.",0
"Yesterday morning I had to put my beautiful, loving cat to sleep and I just do not know what I am going to do. This is my 3rd cat in 8 years, all of which suddenly die before the age of 3 due to things I cannot control. I took my cat to the vet weeks ago and he was fine, then Friday night he was on the verge on the death. He helped with my depression and anxiety whenever it got super high and I relied on him to help me get through whatever i was going through. He was the most important thing in my life and he got snatched from me in the blink of an eye. I do not know why this keeps happening. I just feel empty and am at the absolute worst pain of my life. My Therapy Cat Is Suddenly Gone After 1.5 Short Years",0
What is a best way to die such that people think it was a natural death and i feel almost painless to die? Death,0
"I will make it short, it is late for me.I absolutely love school and other activities, I am (kind of) the ""popular kid"" in school, teachers love me since 1st grade, I have never been in a fight and always get good notes, I am smart, talk a lot and even offered myself as a teacher.And now, what is the problem? Well, I will try to make it even shorter.I am the only son of my family, I have no brothers... well, I have got two siblings, but they almost never come close to us unless they need money for spending in some shit instead of studying, so that leaves me as the only one in the house, and, to be honest, I always fantasize about having a sister that comprehends me and that loves me (as a brother, fcking obviously), that would care about my problems, that would help me in my life and that would talk to me, but the only thing I have is a dog that is too old to go for a walk.To add information to what is above, I always wanted a real friend, someone who is there for me, for talking or hanging out, someone who likes the same things as me and does not ignore me, like many friends I have, when I want to talk, all they do is ghost me...To finish this thingy, I recently fell in love with someone, a very cute girl, shy, likes almost the same things as me, she is perfect for me, I evem walked with her to her home once, and she liked it, I am planning to talk privately with her to compliment her, and try to demostrate that I want her to be 'more than a friend', But I am afraid, afraid of scaring her, afraid of being alone with no love...The reason why I am posting this here is because no one'd listen, no friends of mine would keep a conversation about this without ghosting me, this is my only place to open up to some people. Feel free to trash me in the replies if I did or said something stupid. Goodbye. Even if I am surrounded with people, I feel absolutely lonely.",0
"I know that I should not put so much into a guy. I do not know why my head goes here now that it is all ending. I know it is not healthy. But I am happy most of the time. I feel loved more than I do not. I feel so good and comfortable. I feel so in love. I think about our future, and our kids we may have, and so many other things that are so good that are all about to go away.I do not want another guy. I just want to be happy with this guy. But for some reason now that all this is happening, I just want to hurt myself. I want to cut, I want bang my head up against a wall, tie a rope around my neck, stand in front traffic and see what happens. I am so fed up with feeling unloved and unwanted by the person I want and love the most. Why does me and my boyfriend breaking up make me feel this way?",1
I am not going to tell people when I am like this because I am always like this. I am slowly going to withdraw and then I can go and it will be okay. Idk if this is a sad or happy thing but I know that people will move on. Like maybe it will hurt. But they will move on. And I will finally be free. I am on a mission to stop being a burden,0
"It is hard as hell not to feel bad about this past month. I have how sometimes in life when something goes wrong, it keeps sucking until you die. I hate that some mistakes cannot be fixed. I am trying to hold out hope for the future, but I am constantly reminded of what my life is now. I just have to remind myself I did not know, but I hate that I have to suffer for my naivety. Trying to stay positive. I really do not want to take antidepressants. Feeling down",0
"So recently my mum who lives in the same neighborhood as me told me she runs out onto the street panicking every time she hears the horns of an ambulance slowing down where we live. She walked the dog the other day in the forest close to our street and there was loads and loads of police cars arriving and they closed most of it down, when she asked why they said there was a suicide. She had to be taken to the hospital because she had a huge panick attack thinking it must have been me. I need to get better just for her. I need to. I need to get better",0
"I went out with them today and since I am on holidays I will not see them for another week so this seems like the perfect time to tell them since I will not have to deal with them immediately and also it gives them time to process things. But I just cannot get myself to send it I wrote an almost 1000 word ramble about how I feel, things I have never told anyone, some things that I have bottled up for so long letting go of the one thing I can control is scary. Really I am only planning on telling them the bare minimum which is what I wrote but then they will know and unfortunately the bare minimum is still too much of me that I am giving away, to add on to that even though my friends are not the type to do this, I am scared that they will share it. In hindsight I really do not need to tell them how I feel but I feel so close to offing myself and I am just searching for something to keep me going. Maybe friends support could help, but then I am left alone and vulnerable. I am scared and I do not know what to do I am trying to tell my friends I am suicidal",1
"I do not know why I am venting or what the point of this is. I just went essentially no contact with my toxic pool of relatives and mother, father etc. I have moved every far and things have been a shit show to say the least and while I am able to navigate all of these situations that arise I am mentally fatigued from it all. I have been pulling hat tricks for a year and a half and I do not know for how much longer I can keep it up. I get that resilience and perseverance is key but people telling me that I am insanely strong and all of these useless things... I would just rather not hear. I also wonder how when people give me this ""praise"", how am I actually doing all of these things on my own. I have no shoulder, no open ear, I have only myself to depend on, and while I guess it is always been like that being on the fly in the desert has put a different perspective on things for me. I hate that I did not leave my family earlier, I hate that I endured the abuse, manipulation, lying and gaslighting for so long. So mad I did not realize the fake friendship, and passive indifference. So upset with myself for letting these things fly right over my head. I know better, I know I know better.I can only look forward but it is hard to want this for myself only. I am definitely not the type to kill myself, but I do self-sabotage and I know this. All these tiny things keep cropping up putting just even one more small obstacle in front of me and it is starting to weigh on me. I do have a formal diagnosis, two, and am currently unmedicated, but also without medical coverage atm due to all the moving and running away stuff. I have combed my mind for every possible alternative in this situation and am grateful I am still clear enough of mind to make safe/sound and wise decisions for myself. Asking for help tends to be useless as I can come up with better/more efficient alternatives myself. And sometimes when I talk to people about all the shit I am doing and have to do they just stare in awe of how I am juggling and handling all these things unmedicated and not strung out right now, not an appropriate response. Whatever. I guess not everyone is as strong/forward thinking/hard working as I was made out to think everyone had to be, good. I am proud of who I am at this age, I always strived to be a well-rounded young adult growing up, to be a good partner to whoever I am with and at this age I think I can say I have achieved those things. I will always be working to better myself as you should never stop working on yourself and there is always room to make improvements.Nobody said it would be easy, but nobody said it would be so hard.I will spend my 25th birthday in a I land I am unfamiliar with, by myself, with the most peace of mind I have ever had in my entire life. I think I have won. Hats off to breaking generational trauma (bonds), shit sucks but someone is' got to do the foot work. But yes it is depressing. Hate it, but love this for me",0
hello! my name is ang and I am 16 years old. I have been struggling with my battle of anxiety and depression for quite a long time now. right now I am going through a rough period of not being able to get out of bed and just sleeping and crying. to me i feel the meaning of life is so pointless and the point of human life is dumb. i miss being able to feel something. i feel so lost. idk how to release my pain. I am trying not to do something dumb but at this point i feel there is no point for me to be here. any sort of comment is appreciated :) thanks Lost in Life,1
"I do not know any communities where being sad but not exactly depressed. Like I do not feel like shit all the time or for long periods of time, just in bursts like a mild depressed state.Whenever I get in these states, I tend to think of how much I hate my life(but I do not). I do not really feel the need to commit suicide or have a strong desire too but I do think about it, I guess often but have never tried it. Maybe I am in denial but I am never talking to some therapist or even friends and family about my personal issues. I try to keep my thoughts and emotions private and confined. One thing I do feel is, I have an intense desire to be alone. I feel fake, like forced happiness everyday to talk to friends and my family. I just want to be alone, for a long time. Sometimes, I wish I had the balls to run away and disappear or just move out. But no, I continue to sit at home each day, playing video games and watching youtube as I have cheated on every assignment and test since I have started college. I really do not know what to do with my life, I know I am a failure but I will not feel terrible tommorow. I could die tonight and I hope I am forgotten as quickly as possible, I do not want anyone to know except whoever has too.But I will just be better in the morning and go along with life until I hit another depressed mood. Does anyone know what this condition is because I do not think its depression depression? I am not depressed just sad",0
literally what is the point of being around? nothing even seems worthwhile anymore. I wish the constant abyss would stop for a moment so I can take a breath. I feel like I am drowning but no one is around to throw me a line what is the point of being around,0
"I can ignore how unsatisfied I am most of the time. Can go for walks, try to practice mindfulness, be present in my surroundings, find some transient comfort in the moment. Be grateful for what I have.But all that does is just shovel my feelings of unsatisfaction and self loathing aside. Shove it into a box. Or maybe ite more like building a damn, and occasionally the damn breaks or the reservoir is over-full and everything just floods in. Without flung e into specificd this is *not* where I wanted to be at this point in my life. Worse, I cannot actually imagine my life being any different anymore.I mean, it would be foolish and unrealistic for somebody approaching 40 too imagine they could become a professional athlete. I have no desire to do that, but that is how everything feels to me me. *Every path feels totally unfeasible*. I have no particular goals or interests. So all I can do is plod along, the best I can hope for is a job I do not actively hate.Honestly if somebody said I could press a button to wipe my life from existence without causing others pain it would be hard to not press it. I can easily just shove my negative thoughts aside, but all it means is that' there is a void of feeling. Then occasionally the barrier breaks and I feel very sad.",0
I currently hate my job and just looking for a new job I cannot see myself being interested in anything. I feel like my depression makes everything seem out of my range of ability. Fml... Do you work and if yes what do you do?,0
It feels like my middle chest is tight. My heart feels like it is beating too fast. Sometimes it feels like it is hard to breathe. My eyes get really watery and it is hard to cry. Some days it feels like I just want to rip my chest open to make it stop. The first time it happened i was in dance class. I had that tight feeling in my chest and I just started crying I did not know what was wrong. After that I quit. I started losing interest in things I loved. Sometimes I would not even go to school and I started acting up. I would always be angry and that resulted in me and my mom having rocky relationship. She would ask me what is wrong with me I just would not know what to say. My freshman year I started seeing therapist. They wanted to give me medicine but my mom got upset and told them no. I am 18 now and I am tired of having this feeling. I have been trying to focus on getting my driver's license but it just feels like this a dark force is consuming my body. I cannot keep living like this. Can you feel your depression,0
"I cried the first time tonight in almost 7 years since you died. I turn 26 this year, idk maybe the years apart are finally hitting me.You died approximately 14 years ago, December 28th, 2006. It is now 2021. What in the actual fuc**. Where did the time go? I have always thought of you, I have always brought you everywhere I went. Yet, the memory of you fades almost every step I take. I forget, I grow, I remember. I forget, I grow, I remember. Tonight I envisioned you at the family table, I believe I might have saw you sitting there. I forgotten how much I loved you and your voice and face. D.J. You have always been sitting there, I can feel it now. My tears have been wiped. I cannot wait to see you greet me at the pearly gates. My darling, angel. Dear D.J.",1
"Things were better than good they were great. I spent 14 months, happy, for the first time in 29 years I actually had a happy period in my life, I was sorting stuff out, wed spoke of a future together, a family, Id been talking to a life counsellor and even became optimistic and started letting go of bad moments to keep my mind clear day to day.I drove over to hers after getting some good news that would enable our future, Id made up my mind where Id take her to propose next year, and then that was that. She did not see a future for us.I have barely slept or ate. I keep taking diphenhydramine to try to sleep but I am just taking more and more now to try and not have to deal with the mess inside my head, and still not sleeping. I am heartbroken, and I think this is leading back to the depression that plagued me before. I keep thinking I am soon to be 30, and I have nothing, no one. Everything in my life I have either pissed away or subconsciously ruined.I hate the person I see in the mirror.I keep thinking what is the point to carry on, but I do not even think I could manage going through with anything, let alone even talk to anyone about it - I just feel like I am pathetic for feeling like this. Slipped back to my old mentality",1
"i have been crying myself to sleep for like the past month, I have found that it really helps me fall asleep. it was mostly just overthinking and imagining scenarios in my head that made me upset and made me cry. i kind of feel like it is spiralling into something bigger though - i find myself upset during the day, with low mood and get upset over little things that would not affect me that much before. i feel like this is stemming from me crying myself to sleep every night and want to find alternatives. i did not think too much of it initially as i did not think it was that big of a deal, it was kind of like something that helped me fall asleep and sleep better. id appreciate some advice on how to deal with this and alternatives i can incorporate to help me fall asleep without crying and how i can deal with being easily upset and in a low mood during the day. crying myself to sleep - need alternatives lol",0
"I just want to live without having to push myself so hard. Regardless, I deserve to push myself to death to the point that it drives me nuts to suicidal thoughts. I have made many mistakes, and even if I go back in time and fix my past mistakes, there will be thousands more mistakes to come. People will tell me that everyone makes mistakes and no one should push themselves so hard!, and yet people will get pissed off at me, yell at me, and hurt (physically and/or verbally) me, telling me how much it says about me and not them and how much I deserve the punishment for my mistakes. Its just so fucking ironic lol.Even the littlest mistakes I have made are just so big for me. I am feeling like all mistakes are the same, and that my mistakes will be just as bad as others mistakes.As much as I love everyone on this earth (this includes my family, friends, and even everyone in general), I do not love myself as much. Perhaps I am just too sensitive for this world. Perhaps I am too different for this world.I may be ignored on this sub, but fuck it. Fuck my life, fuck my pain, and fuck all the cruel shit on this earth. I just want to go home called heaven, and let God be able to finally heal me after all the pain and mistakes I have regretted and experienced(I apologized for my profanity. I am still thinking about harming or kill myself) I am too sensitive for this cruel earth. Might as well harm or kill myself in the future",1
"So...HI I am Emma a young trans woman from germany. I am 18 years old and I do not know if i even want to live anymore. A lithle bit of backstory: I growed up in a small catholic village in the middle of nowhare. In school I had big social issues and was just a loner and I was pritty depressed. After school I just got home and watched TV the rest of the day or playd on console and I basicly wasted my whole childhood alone and depressed. My (family) just neclected me and left me alone. Later after I finished school I was just a mental wreck with absolutly no social skills. I dident realy know what to do so I did a BVB that is something like a bridge year to get you ready to learn a job. Around that time a lot of things cleared up in my mind. I aknowledegd that I am trans but still dident do mutch about it beciuse I know that my family would hate me even more and I should wait till i can move out. I lost around 20kg ( I was obese) and actually had social interaction in the BVB i actually made friends i guess. Then the second wafe of corona hit and the BVB stopped vor over six months and we just got some stuff to do per E-Mail. I was stuck at home whit my Family that i do not talk with and I lost contact with the persons I met. I sunk into a deep depression and the Dysphoria ( Stuff that i hate about myself becouse of gender related stuff) just got whorse and I just wanted to end my stupid useless live. I dident self harm myself I wanted to die whitout pain. I dident have acess to medication so I just wanted to cutt my wrist and blead out.... Sometimes I sat there houres whit a fucking kitchen knive in my hand but diden had the guts to just do it. I do not know if its good or bad that I dident do it. My existance just sucked. I kind of opend up about my mum that live is hell for me and i asked her if i could see a terapist, surprisingly she was okay with that. I got to a terapist and kind of tould her everything... Becouse I tould her that i was suecidial i got put into a psychosomatic facility that I stayd for two months. They kind of saved my live in a view ways to be honest. It was the first time in my live that everything seems to be okay. I turned 18 during my stay there. I am now kind of mentaly stable again. They helped ne to get back in kontakt whit my dad. (My parents divorced when I was 3.) and I moved to him directly after I got relesed. That was two weeks ago. My family cut contact with me becouse I moved to there ""enemy"" and I do not realy care tbh. I am proberbly going to do something like a BVB again now and I am proberbly seeking ambulant terapy so i can figure myself out and actually start HRT. I still have a lot of anxiety. But I can at least go shopping and can talk to strangers. The mascs actually realy help! I just have a lot of fear for my future and coud just need some advise. To be honest I do not realy know abaut what. I just feel lost. And I know that so many people got it so mutch whorse but I guess my live has at least some importance at least to me.I hope that what i wrode made at least some sence and I am sorry if my grammer is bad. And just thank you kind strangers from reddit i wish all of you a beautiful night/day! I guess I could use some advice on what i should do with my live.",0
"I always thought how can you call suicidal people cowards? It takes so much bravery to actually hurt yourself and all that jazz. Well today, while i was dabbling in self pity, i realized that the main reason i am suicidal is that i am afraid of the future. I am afraid of taking responsibilities. I am afraid of facing this shitty life alone. I am afraid of stepping up and becoming a functional human being. I am afraid of taking on the responsibility of livingI have a few things i want to see happen, but i do not have any other reason to stay in ~1 year, and many reasons not to stay. Yes i am a coward, and i will die as one, one day. I am a coward",1
I do not want to die as I am aware of what that will do to those unfortunate enough to care about me. I wish i could be removed as though i was not here and spare them the pain of me being gone the normal way and spared having to deal with my continued existence as a strain on their lives. At this point i realised as much i do not care about myself and lack the feeling i care for them suffering as a result of me but all these years have proven i cannot make that small part of me strong enough to change things for the better as even getting out of bed each day is an accomplishment. I wish i could be phased out.,0
I did not fricking ask to be born but yet I have no choice but to live in a society that forces all its goddamn expectations on me as if they still get to fucking control my life to contribute to the community like just fuck that shit you do not give me a choice except to live with those accusations every time I fail to meet your useless expectations I am just sick of it all Expectations are bullshit,0
"Title speaks for itself. For years a close friend and I have been working on getting a house. He ended up having a child with his girlfriend and now they are married, but it was all planned that she would come along and be in our house when we got it. Well, plans changed and my friends wifes parents talked my friends wife out of it and used me as an excuse saying that I am not safe to be around because I went to the mental hospital in the past. They said I am dangerous and Ill end up killing everyone including the kid. They say that, and then say how my firiend is not ready to buy a house, but then forces him on a loan application to buy a house with the in-laws. So now, I am not going to have a home, my friend is locked in with his in-laws, his in-laws have taken total control of my friends marriage and now will not let me anywhere close to the house. Knowing this is how people feel about me (and multiple parties at that) it just brings me down. Ever since I went to the mental hospital, I have been treated like shit by so many people. I have been called a monster, a demon, a threat to society. All because I could not handle my emotions anymore. I wish I could talk to my friends in-law to their face and tell them to tell me I should have killed back then. Honestly I believe it though. I should have just killed myself back then. Its evident the world would have been better off without me, since people are so annoyed by my existence. Jokes on them. I am going to kill myself and make sure people know so they can celebrate my death. I hate this world, and here is another reason. The world has turned its back on me, and now I turn my back on the world. This is the end. People do not trust me purely because I went to a mental hospital before. Feeling like I should have just killed myself back then when I had the chance",1
"I am sorry if this is the wrong place for this post, but I was not sure where else to ask this kind of question.The long version of this story is in my post history, but basically what happened is that I saved someone from a car accident and later found out that she was trying to kill herself and I stopped her, and now she might have to live with permanent injuries.How would you feel about someone that helped you if you were in this same scenario? Do you think you would always be upset with them for ruining your life? I stopped someone from committing suicide and I guess now I am just looking for some perspective on how they might feel about that?",1
"I just sit here everyday. Doing nothing. Accomplishing nothing. By the time its 1 AM or 4 AM, I am in bed crying wondering why I am still alive and scrolling to find some aid on assisted suicide. I have tried suicide hotlines, but they never seem to be able to help me. I have had someone hang up on me before. It was after my father snapped at me and called me ugly that I started questioning whether or not I deserved to live. Everyday he would degrade how I look. I was already aware of it. My teeth are rotten, I have a gap in the middle of my teeth, I am obese, have skin illnesses causing it to look disgusting and wrinkly, and my skin tone is dark meaning I am already ugly to many. Being ugly is just a death sentence/I wish my facade of ""I do not care what people think about me"" was true, but it was not.I have been having other health issues, but I cannot afford to go to a doctor or get therapy. I have anxiety every single day. I cannot ever sleep because recurring nightmares. When I need to take medication, I cannot even take a single pill because my gag reflexes and anxiety. Pretty sure I also have undiagnosed ADHD. I want to go to the doctor, but I fear just being forced to take pills or medicine.My parents get mad at me for not being able to do anything because of my crippling depression, but my agoraphobia is extreme. I never want to go outside. I never want anybody to see me. I feel ashamed at my parents just looking at me. I hate my body and everything about it. I barely take care of my body anymore because of the hate I have for it.If I could say one accomplishment, it would be that I finished college with bachelors of fine arts, but I am getting nowhere in my life. I used to be able to do so many illustrations for clients, but I have not been able to focus or motivate myself and it is causing me extreme distress. I am in so much debt on work I owe for my clients, but I just cannot complete them no matter how hard I try. I tried recently applying for my dream job and I also managed to get it, but I was laid off in a few days because my boss wanted to go travel the world instead of work. I am still stuck in crippling student debt from this with no way of paying it backAll of this just tells me that I am a failure as a human being. My parents constantly tell me that. My sister does not even talk to me anymore and we used to be so close. I used to have friends irl but they just stopped talking to me after college. I tried to ask someone for help saying I am suicidal and lost and all they said was ""mmm okay?"" I lost hope in them. It just feels like nobody cares about me and I do not want to be a waste of space anymore. My body is dying and I see no hope of me improving anytime soon. I still have dreams and wishes, but life does not want me here. I do not know what to do. I want my work ethics back. I want to be healthy. I want to feel like I belong, but it is so hard. I have wishes and dreams, but life does not want me here.",1
Ill have around 900mg of Prozac and I plan on taking it all and mix it with some alcohol and K so that hopefully I can go. I am so exhausted by everything now and I just feel so lost and alone. Next time i get my prescription I am overdosing,1
"I do not want to live anymore. I am struggling in my graduation, which will probably lead to a failure future. I do not have friends, really no one whom I could talk. And my mom is the worst part; she has her dreams and want to enforce them into me. Its been since I was a kid, hers dreams became tortures to me. And now, almost 22, she retorned trying to fit me in on of hers dreams again. I am writing this in my internship, and intend to jump on a car on my way back. I do not know if I will have the courage, but I do not want to live this nightmare anymore. Bad english I known Adjkk",0
"Yeah that is about it . I know I have made a comment or 2 in the past I am sure about it but Recently I realized though that I have sorta become an asshole with it.. not too proud of that one. Ill throw things like alright, well I am going to go eat a bullet now or sure lemme just go walk into traffic first into my daily life without even realizing what I am saying or to who (my mother). To me thinking about it and fantasizing various ways to do it have become soothing in its own morbid way but that is no reason for me to throw it out there so much. I have also noticed i have no real inner monologue too anymore thoughts do not seem to stay up there where they belong and just kind of come out without any regard to how others may feel about it. Idk, maybe I am just slowly going crazy. But i do know my inner asshole tendencies have begun affecting my life so i think its time i finally cave in and go to talk to someone professional fml Idk, thoughts??? Lol Suicidal ideation as a coping mechanism",1
"I get these brief 5 seconds of motivation and hope, I can be like everyone else, stable and successful. Then my brain brings me back to reality, and reminds me of how I cannot. Every time I go to apply for jobs on Indeed or try to write down some sort of plan for the future, I just cannot do it. I physically feel nauseous thinking of having to be strong and try everyday. I want it all to end now. I do not want to build something for myself, I do not want to be successful. I just want to be air or a cloud. I do not like being human. Every time I have cared about someone, I lose them because I can become obsessive. My first crush landed me in the psych ward for 2 weeks because he did not like me back. that is what waiting for me whenever I catch feelings again. I cannot take this pain and I wish not to feel it. The bad significantly outweighs the good. I do not want to try anymore.",1
I am so fucking tired of feeling like this. A deep sadness deep into my bones. Exhausted,0
"So I was going pretty good for a while, I had a pretty stable-ish job with a partner I loved, started working on my credit score to hopefully get surgeries or a house or whatever else. I had about 4k saved up in my bank that I saved from scratch alone, as I would been unemployed for quite a while beforehand and rapidly needed to save money. Life was good, or seemingly so - my gf had always wanted to move to Oregon, and seeing as how I had the money, and a job that could be transferred over ( and she is literally my gf who is moving so I got to come with lmfao ) I took it. I got here with no house, I lived in a hostel for about a month which was miserable and afterwards met this pretty cool dude who gave me a place to stay. Unfortunately the system failed him too and he is being deported back to India, meaning for me I now have no money and no house and no gf and no stability. Everything I have scraped by to make my own, to chisel out of the fucking marble rock that is my life has just as quickly collapsed around me and I am left to pick up the pieces. I am about to be homeless, penniless, nameless, and overall worthless to anyone around me save my body. Hey hey me again",1
I was planning on kms before I turned 18 but obviously that did not happen. I am very depressed and confused. I have no friends and I am failing school. I wish I could just disappear. Its my 18 birthday and I am currently crying myself to sleep.,1
"I am severely traumatized and in the lowest throes of depression. I could fill a book with experiences that would horrify the average person. It is truly remarkable that I am alive, and life is something that I hate to no end. This is a trigger warning, because even though I would probably despise you, I respect your membership in a ""moral community."" I am going to vent some things that contribute to my depression. do not read it, straight up. To preface, I am not some 14 year old kid struggling with new emotions. I am 31, and I have experienced pretty much exclusively low points throughout my life, interspersed with extensive, mind-destroying misery that nearly killed me several times. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this. Keep in mind that I do not care about your feelings, and I do not seek validation. I feel nothing but hatred and sadness.",0

"Hi, anonymous account for obvious reasons.I feel so utterly done; I have had enough. I am living in a flat on my own with no-one caring to visit. I have a few local friends who have their own lives which I understand but they choose not to visit at all. I have other long term friends who will never message, let alone call and I am tired. I tried moving here and being happy but with no contact, I just cannot.A few months ago my Mum was diagnosed with cancer, 6-9 months to live and she is currently going through the choice of whether to go through chemo or not. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought that it would break her heart... I am scared this is not going to be enough for me. Instead I will fade away from everyone is lives, apart from the only person who actually cares who now has a timer. I do not want to fade slowly and have no-one even know I am alive. The last couple of weeks after reading a few forums, I cannot stop picturing myself a little older, lying on the floor of a hotel as people walk past saying 'that is sad' and... that is it... Does no-one care anymore?I think I have alienated everyone and I do not know why. Since the original diagnosis in April, suddenly noone seems to actually care. The only person I thought did cancelled plans 4 times in 8 days last week and I think it is broken me but I cannot say anything; if I do I will be alone here. So instead, I feel the need to stop contact but then, that is literally everyone I know, gone...I did not expect any of this. People who I have been there for in the past, just gone.This just feels utterly undeserved and devastating. I have always made way to try and help others; elevate yourself by elevating others but I have been totally abandoned. I am the guy who used to stop and talk to random people and get along but now... If I walk to the sea, stand and cry, people just walk past... I am already a ghost.I am seeking help but could do with anonymous perspectives without judgement. I have got nothing left and it is deeply concerning me.I have tried working out but keep plummeting in weight. I am signed up of speak to someone and tried medication but there is just nothing. I do not know how the world suddenly became so lonely.I am not going to respond to any posts but I will read them all. I need advice/help",0

"I am about to graduate nursing school and I just know in my heart I have made a huge mistake and it is not for me. I have just wasted years of my life and I am so mad at myself for going through all of this. I really do not know what I want in life and I am 35! I was raised in a high control religion, so I was raised suppressing my own desires and wants. Both of my parents committed suicide, my mother when I was 19 and my father when I was 25 and I have just been trying to cope. I thought this career might help but I have gone into it for the wrong reasons and I just have too much anxiety to even see myself continuing. I got out of the religion about 3 years ago just as I was entering nursing school and now I have been cut off from basically all of the friends and family I had. I am just a huge failure and a waste. I have wasted my life",0

I thought that.... falling in love for the last time could help me. I thought this time it would be different, but it was not. I am so sad, quiet, lonely, and shy about it, I am empty, but now I see that... nothing good happens to me, I know that with all my heart since i was a kid, i knew it again today in my bones. yes, nothing good happens, i do not get better.. now i know. yesterday i was secretly so scared that my boyfriend might not like me anymore, buttoday he did it so true. now i know I am nothing. its like many facts about that... in conclusion i do not deserve life: i was not the one bfore, i never going to be.

"I realized that the reason I procrastinate doing certain things is because in a way I do not think the event is real. Like I never tried to get scholarships for school because I guess I thought I had more time. But even with all the time in the world I just do not do it and I think that is because I am so unsure about school and if I am even meant to go. I feel like half my brain is able to acknowledge that this physical world is real but then the other half of my brain is scared and confused and is like I do not want to be here anymore I want this to end. Like when you are watching a bad movie and it makes no sense and you want fo walk out the theatre. I say scared too because this feeling is very lonely. I am a person who is alone a lot and who is independent in a lot of ways - so when I am left alone like in my bedroom I just get such an odd feeling like this world is so unfamiliar to me. I live with my mom and even if I hear her talk downstairs I am just confused. Or if I am not with my dad I just feel confused. I know I keep saying confused because I do not know another way to explain it. I guess its just a feeling of loneliness and wanting to know too much about a concept (life and the spirit) that no one knows the answer to. I guess the best word to use would be that this world feels very dream like. And I want it to feel real, not dream like. I feel unreal and it scares me",0

I finally fucking did it but I get dreaged back in i was actually going to do it once I got on that train the was no going back the was no going back once I left the house ebut uk got forced back in. But I would of been dead by now. And a part of me is happy because my oarnwst do not have to deal with me being sad they can enjoy the life not deal with the death if the child.But then again it is just another life there is an infinite amount of universes/planets where I have killed myself this happen an incite amount of time so this one time it will not make a difference.Sorry just had to get this off my chest.

"I need a new best friend. I need someone who can support me and not encourage leaving me out. I am so broken I have no tears left to cry I am numb I look in my drawer and see all the propanalol boxes and I am so tempted. But I cannot. Everything has came tumbling down on me at once as I have been pushing everything to the back of my head now all my worries have just piled up. I am hanging on by a thread, being 16 and having a medication box its so hard. Everyone else my age is drinking but I cannot because of my anti depressants. My mental health has caused me to miss out in so much I cannot describe how left out and abandoned I feel I cry in my room every night broken. Then I wake up like nothing happened. I was self harm free for 2 months, I was so proud of myself but that did not go to plan I started harming again recently and the worst part is that it does not hurt anymore. I am so used to it now the first time I cried because it hurts now well its just painless, I hate it and hate feeling like this sometimes I wonder why am I still here? what is the point. This right here is where I get my feelings out I am not sure what to do anymore",0
"To give a back story growing up the house hold was very abusive I.e physical abuse, emotional abuse and food was not always given (even when we had the means to do so). I went to college taking 45-60 thousand dollars in debt, basically as a way to get out of the abusive household with no real idea or plan. I am now 24 and know what I enjoy doing as a career path but refuse to go back to school and put myself through further debt. It feels as though I am unable to move on with my life and I am very stuck. I love my partner but I am also sure they would be better off without me. I feel I am too old to go back to school and will not make much if I do not. At this point in time I have given up on the idea that tomorrow will be better. I have chosen to isolate myself from everyone in order to not feel less inadequate regarding myself and to not have them feel bad as its hard to be happy about their achievements currently. Has anyone else felt like this, and if so what do you do? No achievable ambition",1
"I need help i have no idea what to do or who to ask. I am a 17 year old girl who lives with her single mom. Everything was fine about a year ago when my dad was here with us. We had a hotel a restaurant and also an outlet store, I would not necessarily say we were rich no not all actually, we were just fine we were happy. However, my dad passed away suddenly we have no idea what happened and how but one night my mom woke me up and we had to watch him choke and die in his bed. Ever since that day we had to sell our car out restaurant our shop etc. we were left with basically nothing but each other. Fast forward to today, every single day i have to watch my mom cry and pray for help, we have no money and her job is not stable nor does it pay well. I am so tired I do not know if i can keep doing this, I cannot go to college because we cannot afford it, i cannot find a job because I am either under qualified or underage. I am trying so hard to be strong and help my mom out i stopped going out to minimize spending money, i stopped buying things and all that just led to me stopping to even see my friends because they always spend money and i do not know how to tell them that i cannot do that. I feel so left out and alone, i have no one and i just have to do something i know but what? Please I am begging you someone give me advice, anything honestly I am ready to sell my body or become a stripper as long as i can make my mom happy and as long as i can buy her her dream little house with a small garden. I do not care what happens to me i just want her to be happy she is had enough and she is been through SO much. If all that was not bad enough her brother has no job and no money for food and she provides for him too. He took out a loan and spent all his money in a casino and my mom has to pay it now. I am hopeless. I cannot do this anymore as bad as this sounds i need moneyi do not know howLong until I decide cannot do this anymore and just give up. PLEASE HELP ME SOMEONE",0
"I have always had suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager but in recent years things have been bad. The last year has been difficult for me as I was made redundant last July. I live with my mother, I am still a virgin at the age of 31, never had a girlfriend or kiss a girl. I suffer from low confidence/self esteem issues, anxiety and depression. I have also self harmed. I have seen counsellors on several occasions, referred to CBT, taken anti depressants, spoken to the Mental Health crisis team on several occasions on the phone.It still has not hampered my thoughts of killing myself and then feeling worse for not having the courage to do so. Everyday I look in the mirror I turn away in disgust at my appearance and fight the urge to smash my head in the mirror. The only time I feel at ease is when I sleep and am not plagued by nightmares.Is it wrong to feel that though death is permanent at least the suicidal feelings in my head will stop.

"but I have tried every imaginable means to get over it for so long to no avail. I still cannot convince myself that I can live without a life partner. Every fleeting conversation with a woman gives me hope that is immediately dashed. Every time I hear other people setting each other up, I want to jump in front of a train. I even try to stay home and avoid women as much as possible, but that leads to other things that remind me of them.there is just no way out of this. I cannot even kill myself because there is always the carrot of tomorrow, maybe tomorrow I will meet the one, but deep down I know there is no hope, I cannot compete with other dudes.

Nothing grand, just little gestures that meant something to you. I know I cannot cure him by being nice and I do not expect to, I just want to make his day as easier as I can.

"I have never lived a year of my life without getting this feeling multiple times. i feel so disgusted by people looking at me, thinking about me, talking about me, thinking they know me and having ideas about me when they know absolutely nothing. i hate the fact other people can see me. i feel so embarrassed and disgusted by everything about myself. its literally humiliating when someone takes pictures of me or has a conversation about me. i hate the moments when i show any emotion in front of someone else and i hate that i am pressured to do so. smiling, hugging, speaking, doing anything that is seen as things you are supposed to do makes me feel like i am degrading myself.i do not know wtf this feeling is. it comes up often and i do not know how to call it other than i completely hate everything about myself i hate being a human i hate my body and my voice and my personality. i have things i like about myself and they are all trapped in my head where no one even knows they exist, so everything that is pure and not horrible about me is something nobody knows about. i try so hard to look and act the way that is good and clean and represents who i am and i always fail. i can put hours into working on my hair and clothes and they will look dirty and like i put no effort in.there is just something about me that is so horrible and carries this awful vibe of rotting filth. its like i was cursed from the very moment i was born. i need to make money so i can get plastic surgery and then move away from everyone I have ever known and start a new life hopefully having escaped being this filthy creature. i need to change everything to get rid of this feeling. it hurts so fucking much i do not understand why i feel this way and I am so angry that i have to deal with this and no one gets it i want a moment of peace idk if this is normal in depression. i come out of every social moment feeling like I have sinned against myself",0

"I (17) have spent the last school year seeing my school counsellor every week. Honestly, she is the best and the greatest support I could have had, and helped me get diagnosed through all the suckiness of my parents not believing in mental illness. She emailed my teachers on my off days, checked in with me before big tests, believed me. And this Friday will be the last time I see her because she is leaving.My question is, how do I cope? Its honestly devastating, as Ill be losing my main support, and I have grown to admire her as a person. Also, what will I do next year if I have a problem or something happens that she would normally help with? I will not be able to have emergency sessions with her anymore.I know this is possibly all sounding a little bit silly, but she has helped me a lot, and honestly? I just feel really, really sad, and I am scared Ill get into a funk after saying goodbye. My school counsellor is leaving. What do I do?",0

How do some not care?",1
"Okay first of all I start by that my native language is not English, and I am also really bad at telling/explaining.So here it goes.As the title has suggest I do not know if I am living nor existing, I am just here for with no purpose, in the past few weeks, it feels like that I am sitting in the void in an empty room, whatever I do or want to do brings me down makes me exhausted and tired, I try to enjoy the things that I think I like but it just will not do it anymore, everything feels like a chore, or even better said it feels like that I am just a mindless robot, I wake up, go to work come back home, and that is it, even if I try to go outside, it does not feel like living. I have someone in my life that I have feelings for but lately I am asking myself whose feeling they are, as if I would not be me. I am in a constant self hatred, quilt, shame and all sort of negative emotions. I have already written two letters one for her and one for my parents (You guys know what I talk about), and it is just getting difficult by the day to fight against it. I have been trying to get help, but in the Area I am living in is almost impossible to find someone who is available and specialized in the type of therapy I need. It is a constant struggle, and it just feels like what ever I do makes zero sense.I tried to explain it as good as I can, I am sorry if most of you will not be able understand what I tried to write, talking is not my strength at all. But I thank you guys for taking your time and reading it. I do not feel like if I am living nor existing.",0

Seriously, I cannot be a friend; I can just talk about my pathetic existence and how I would love for someone to just save me. I am so far beyond broken.

I feel like it is been enough, but it just will not stop. I hate it here. I miss being happy. I miss waking up and actually looking forward to doing things. I am tired of trying to find safety from my thoughts. I am tired of isolating because I am too fucked up to be a friend right now. Like, seriously, I just want things to get better, but they are not. I do not know why this had to happen to me. I really do not. I really do not know why I had to be one of the people this affects. I seriously cannot endure it. I am empty. I have had enough.

"english is not my mother language, sorry if its a bit all over the placethrowaway due to a pointless fear of someone clicking my profile and recognizing mealcohol, gambling, not even masturbation makes me feel anything anymore. by my own means I have been depressed since 8th grade which makes it almost 8 years by now. I have never seen a future to myself since the age of 14before high school i was kind of a recluse doing my own thing, playing my own games on the computer and not very popular but since i discovered parties and alcohol I have been a main man that everyone invites. since then I have gotten along with everyone not depending on gender, the sarcastic humorist that everyone needs in their life, I have been a shoulder to cry on for males and females and I have always been someone that has given advice to them that they have benefitted from. since high school ended I have noticed that all my friends have gotten some type of lives and I have always been the one who has been included into new friend groups that have formed from those times that have quite not made it yet. but now is the time that these friends have ran out and I am starting to be the only one who cannot move on.I am from quite a dysfunctional family and i am now working a very severe manual labor job that i just do because i could not stay for more than a year in university due to never having learned the ability to study by being able to cruise through high school without any problemsi have no goals in life because everything feels pointless, although i realise that it is not pointless because my life and something that i do could matter to someone but i am really at a crossroads now by binge drinking at the weekends but does not seem a fast enough slow suicide. even thought of becoming an opioid addict because id have a point to wake up in the morning to get my next fix. sounds absolutely idiotic i know, but this is where I am at noweverytime i get together with my old friends I have acted like its all ok and bullshit my way out of it but I have started to drink more compared to them when i see them and its starting to damage the relationship i have with themits probably a shamble and it took a lot from me to write this since and not delete it like i tried to many times during this post.

"I am a gay trans man and have so many years of complex trauma, I hate my job, I feel like no one loves me or believes me or treats me like the person I am, I know feelings are not facts but I am so fucking tired of feeling like this.

I have been gay as long as I have known even though it was something I had to push down for many years and I did not even realize being trans was something you could be but it is, after an occasional bump of not feeling like shit due to life saving shit like Spravato, I feel like my pain is back and I am just tired of having to fight back so so hard. I feel like my life is meaningless but I know it is not. I want to kill myself, not the current self but the old self and finally be the man I am supposed to be.

"alright, so first i have to admit that my biggest need in life is to feel loved. not just loved, but to have someone that finds me attractive and is turned on by me and my body. including my penis. now, when i was younger. say, teen and young adult. i really did not care too much about my penis size. sure i would be a bit embarressed by it and was always one to hold off on sexual activities until i had been with a girl for a little while. but it did not because depression. I am in my 30's now and my life experiances has taken me from thinking ""size is not everything"" to litterally crying more often then i would like to admit over my penis size. I am a grower first off. and at full staff its not too bad i guess. below average but not micro by any means. but soft its less then an inch for sure. in fact. when I am sitting down its litterally inside me. anyway. because of this i have never been much for one night stands or to go around having sex with lots of woman. with the exeption of twice in my life, i have just been a long term relationship type. i have had 4 previous relationships (one was marriage for almost 10 years). and i am on my 5th currently. all 4 of those, i was cheated on. multiple times. my ex wife i had even found that she was telling the other guys that i was small and she did not get turned on my it. taking something i was already a little self consious about, and adding in that EVERY girlfriend i have had has cheated on me. i am now VERY needy in terms of exeptence of my penis size. my current relationship, we have sex once or twice a month and that is it. she says she is just not a very sexual person. but see, we were friends before we started dating and, she used to talk about loving to give blowjobs, and she even had a FWB just because she loved giving them so much she had someone she could just go suck any time she wanted. so i cannot help but feel like its me. like i have an underwelling penis that just does not get her going. my life at this point revolves around my self loathing over my penis size. I feel like the ONE thing i need more then anything i can never have because no girl gets excited about small penis'. the best i hear is woman that say they do not mind it. or that it does not matter to them. but i clearly have never even found that. i do love my current girlfriend and she is good to me any many non sexual ways. and i feel i cannot give my true feelings to her because that might seem like guilt tripping and when it comes to sex, guilt tripping someone, in many ways, is a bit..... well... i cannot think of the word so i will use an example. a guy that guilts a woman into sex because she gave him blue balls would be considered a pig right? so i feel like if i talked about this with her it would be similar. like..... oh you should have sex with me more because i need to feel like my penis size is ok.... i just cannot do that. i do not feel right about it. even if i know in my head that is not my reason. in my head I am not doing it as a guilt trip. that is still kind of too close to the same category. so i sit here. so damned depressed that i cannot even ""take care of myself"" when i feel the urge sometimes. i feel sad and like i will never feel truly loved and desired. you know, let us talk about porn for a moment. i am not one to use it when i am in a relationship. but i had a few years between my ex and my current girl to have watched a bit and really dig around to see what is out there. and i am starting to cave a bit and use it from time to time just because of how in frequent we have sex. but the point of bringing up porn is this.... there is fetishes for basically everything. feet fetishes. old people. fat people. short people. tall people. big boobs. small boobs. ect ect. i mean the list is endless. but you know what i cannot find? a porn fetish catagory for woman that like small dicks. you can find a fetish for woman that like to be pee'd on and deficated on. but not that like small penis'. in fact. the only small penis fetish i can find is HUMILIATION. which is the LAST thing i want to see and just know that its out there depresses me even more. its depressing to think that every woman i have ever been with has been so displeased by it that they decided to go find a bigger one to play with on the side. i tried anonymous video sites a few times when i was single and that left me crying every time. you find a girl that wants to cam with you. and as soon as she see's what i am working with, she either clicks off immediatly, or she stays to laugh and call it small. there was one time that i thought that maybe witholding the information that i had a small dick until the relationship was a few weeks old (or more) was my problem. so when i was talking to this one girl, i waiting for her to bring up sex in the conversation and when she finally did, i informed her i was small. she asked for a picture so i sent her one. she litterally just stopped replying. never heard from her again. like. i genuinly feel like maybe they feel like they have been scammed or something. start a relationship with me. i seem like a good boyfriend. and then bam. small dick. i do not know what to do. i know i should not put so much into my penis size. but my life experiances has caused this and i can no longer convince myself its ok. i can no longer believe size does not matter. or its the motion of the ocean. or that looks are not everything. or that you can make up for it in bed with other things like mouth skills and so on. i just want someone to genuinly like my penis. and i will never have that. small ""member"" causing major depression",0
"Life is meaningless. You go to school, get a job that you never really liked, retire, then die. Sure, you make friends, but they never really listen to you when you talk about yourself, their eyes drifting to a place above your right shoulder. The things you enjoy slowly loose their appeal, and you are just left there thinking and feeling nothing. So I am genuinely curious, why do you even try to get better what is the point?",0

"I do not think I am actively suicidal in this moment. If i really wanted to die right now i could just go to the river and jump off the bridge, but i guess my true preferred method would be to just shoot myself in the head.I have watched a lot of videos in the past of people killing theirselves and it mostly looks horribly painful. I cannot imagine the weight of my own gravity pulling me down only from the neck; were i to hang myself by jumping, eliminating the chance of pulling myself back up, chances are i would be decapitated if not unraveled from a mediocre try at tying the damn thing. And trains? Fuck that. Jesus.A gun though. If i could just get my hands on a loaded gun. I do not let myself. I still have to update my address on my drivers license, I have thought about going to a range but that would just be unfortunate for everyone else there.I live alone. So if i had a gun, even if its for protection, at some point i would probably do it. I would text my neighbor hey, I am really sorry, but i need you to call the police for me and tell them to come over. there is nothing you could have done, I am already dead. But thanks for always having been such a wonderful neighbor. Tell them the key is under the doormat.I have so many letters in mind to so many people. So many saying the same things. Sorry. Not your fault. Etc.But now I am going off on a tangent. I will not do it because i still have my family. My parents live nearby and my brothers away for college and i know how it would affect them.But i guess what i was hoping that someone could answer is which would be more lethal or at least because unconsciousness quicker: handgun shot through the temple or through the roof of mouth?Like i said, I am not going to do it. I know how it would affect those in my life. I do think about them. But i would just like to know.Sometimes it looks so quick, they drop instantly. But other times, you hear their groans even after. Its haunting.Thanks I figure this might be the only place to speak without getting deleted or sent away but well see",1

"I do not want to go home. It feels like being home has turned into a cycle of: bad thoughts creep in - try to resist them - fail - anxious about failing - surviving the night until I can sleep.Because sleeping used to reset my head, but it is not working anymore.I just do not want to go home, but it is not like there is anywhere else to go.Fuckin hell, man, I thought I had beaten this shit a year ago, but here we are again. it is bad because I had not thought about dying in a while, but it is coming back. I am typing this in my car, outside work, where I have been for about an hour now.At least there is this sub. I feel a little bit less lonely reading your stories. Going home is killing me a little bit each day",0

"I figure I will leave a note here and in my note pad app because fuck it lol. I have no one now. My family does not give a fuck about me and I do not care about them. The only person I was sticking it out for is gone and I doubt will come back. We ended on good terms but fuck it, life is and has been silent agony for the last 14 years. All my family that loved me (my mom, aunt, grandpa, first dog) are dead or have dementia (my grandma). No one else gives a flying fuck about me so come the week of the 18th I am going to treat myself for a few meals to a dinner at a local expensive Italian restaurant, and maybe a few other places have t decided yet since I will be all alone that week. I think my last meal is going to. Be steak Mac n cheese and enough wine to get drunk off my ass with so I can get the balls to just hang myself or jump off a close bridge into the river (at least 40 feet from bridge to water). I cannot stand being alone. We had plans to get an apartment together in August, we have a dog together. I really thought we could be together for ever but clearly I am unlovable even by my own family I guess it no surprise. I am tired. So fucking tired of feeling less than others, like I am not worth love or time from other people. My dad and his fiance are getting married around those days, oh fucking well. Enjoy you wedding and honeymoon and all the rest of your summer. Never invited me to anything fun, just assumed I would rather sit out and rot or god forbid spend time with me to go see a fucking movie. Nope. Rather go golfing with someone else at the spur of the moment. You, her and your friends and her kids go wine tasting even after telling me no because it is too expensive. Go fuck yourselves. you have always been a shitty father and a shitty husband. No fucking wonder mom left your ass. I would too if I had a husband like you.Now on to your precious son Matt, oh if only the shit you knew he did to me as a child. He ruined my chances at growing up in a normal house because you let him go off his bipolar medications. Also never though I would put it out there but he molested me when I was 7. So go gloat how proud you are of him some more.Tom. I am proud of you. You were a good big brother and although we are not close. You were still kind to me growing up and I appreciate that even though we are not blood related. I am not angry at you in anyway and I hope this does not affect you. Sue,Joe, Megan. I do not know what happened. I truly do not. We all used to be so close growing up. But then as soon as I hit 18 no contact unless I reach out first. No invites to lake house when you are clearly up there. No invites to holidays or even wishing happy____ unless I say it first. I doubt any of you ever think about me. Sawyer: DO NOT FOLLOW AFTER ME, STAY ABD KEEP VOODOO HAPPY AND MOVE ON. I CAUSED ENOUGH MISERY BEING ALIVE. I LOVED YOU WITH ALL MY BEING AND IF I CAN I will SEND YOU SOME SIGN OF THE AFTERLIFE. THANK YOU FOR ALL you have DONE FOR ME THESE 8 YEARS. you have BEEN MY BEST FRIEND WHEN EVERYONE ELSE LEFT AND I CANNOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW I FEEL. I AM NLT ANGRY AT YOU. you have BEEN MORE THAN I EVER DESERVED AND THE BEST I will EVER HAVE. I LOVE YOU AND PLEASE FORGIVE ME.If I had a loving family maybe I could get through this easier but I guess fate has other plans.I want to donate what can be salvaged off my corpse. The rest just cremate and toss in the lake. Everyone can have whatever possessions I have but I want my money donated to a German shepherd oriented charity or just to the SPCA. IF I fuck up I do not want to be kept on life support. LET MY SUFFERING END.I highly doubt there is an afterlife but I do not want to see any of you there if there is one. I honestly hate most of you now. I was 100% correct when I assumed my boyfriend was going to breakup with me. My date is now set.",1
"I am 20. I have hated myself my entire life, and always figured I would kill myself eventually so I have made zero investments in my future. My friend died a few months ago. He hung himself. After seeing what it did to his family, friends, and honestly what it did to me, I have resigned myself to living. But I still do not want to live. I will not do anything for myself. will not help myself. Because I deserve everything I do to myself. My mom tells me I almost got hit by a truck riding my bike as a kid and sometimes I wonder if I was not supposed to die that day because its the only thing that makes sense. I fell through the cracks and now I am stuck in limbo, unable to die, unwilling to live, doing nothing but taking up space in my home, wasting my familys time and energy. Stuck in limbo.",1

"Long storry short i had a rough childhood and developed depression pretty early on. I was bullied to to multiple reasons, main one Being slightly facialy disfigured. When my father got sick with cancer i was 21 and started drinkin heavily. I continued that for 3 years. Booze killed my pain, but i was also higly emotional about stuff. Most of the folks described me as a good guy. I would literally give you clothes of my back. I even learned to fond Joy in my depression and saddnes. It was all i knew. Till i was put on an ""mild"" ssri. I cannot remember the name because i just did not care at that point in life. Just wanted to stop the booze and pain. Then i noticed i became less emotional and non emphatic. I contributed that to becoming strong because off all the shit i been trough. When my father died i menaged to cry but i mostly felt empty. I was working out and that was my only outlet, only thing i could get any good feeling from. So i decided to quit the meds cold turkey. Back than i did not know that antidepressants can because withdrawls. After about a Month of emotional rollercoaster , suicidal thougts and anxiety i finally melted down in front od my moms and decided i would spend a few weeks at a psyhc ward. Big mistake... They put me on Effexor or Velafaxine and Clonazepam. I am on it for the last two years and i noticed i became a totally diffrent person. I do not longer care about much to the Point of Being dangerously reckless. I gained a shit ton of weight and lost my personality. I also do not have any libido and desire for any kind of romance or even friendly contact. I forgot what Being horny or having and erection means, But what i have is dangerous and violent thoughts. Like i would like to fight with anyone, absolutely fearless. Before all the meds i had social anxiety, was overthinking about how People percive me, was anxious in mans situations and was generaly weak.now i just do not care. I only have some feelings for my mom, aunt and my dog. If i saw someone got hit by a car or some other horrible acident i think it would not even trigger a emotional response in me... Its pretty scarry. I tried to go off them but the withdrawls are too much. I cannot go on much longer Like this. Is anybod out there that understads this mess I am in or have i just became a sociopath. Sorry for the long post i just need to vent out. I am a she will of what i used to be. A vent about depression and meds. Anyone out there feeling Like me. Sorry for the long post",0
"all the hurt and pain and suffering that is going on every day. all the poor animals that are getting tortured and exploited for humans' pleasure, nature, poor ppl in third world countries .. it all hurtsthe monotony of the typical day to day life in cities - work, eat, social media or TV, sleep. especially work taking up SO much our lives.. It makes me rly hate living. I hate all of this. I hate living in a world this disgusting and it even makes me ashamed to be a human, bc of the amount of suffering we are causing to other beings and each other every day.it hurts, and I am sad to say that I find it rly difficult to, in a sense, ""turn myself off"" to these things and live in blissful ignorance, enjoying the ""little things"" like my silly little hobbies and tv shows and whatnot.I simply cannot. I just do not see the point in any of these things...I get that it is my own life and a lot of those things are not within my control, and that I should just focus on what would make me happier.but.. how could I turn a blind eye to all these horrible things while being ""happy""? how could I be happy when there is all these things going on everyday?I cannot stand to live in this worldI want to dieI just want to dieI find it so strange that my brain is always like, I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. when I am not actually like realistically suicidal. like I am not planning my suicide or anything and I also doubt I will ever be brave enough or want it badly enough to actually take action. (probably) so then if that is the case then why do I keep having such thoughts as ""I want to die""? I just really badly not want to exist, I guess. all the ""good"" in this world is nowhere near enough to negate all the hurt and suffering and pain that goes on everyday, all over this planet.I am tired. I do not want to be hereI do not want to.. be I cannot seem to take it anymore, living in a world like this",0
"I feel so stupid and horrible for how I feel today how mean I was to a friend.My friends helped me so much though my depression and got me out to my hips. They were there for talking, crying and advice.But I am angry at them, I envy them I want them to feel miserable like me to understand how much I suffer because of my loneliness and our now mostly distance relationships. (living in different city's)(I live alone since I was 16, I went home for 4 year when I was twenty but nobody cared about my emotions there too, so I moved out to flee the toxic environment and parents. Now I live alone again for like 5 years.I could never build deep connections because I did not had one and my parents and some old friends made sure I learn not to trust people.Making friends was hard and the best thing in my life. I would do everything for them after they were there for me when my family was not. I cannot complain I thought.) But here I am angry at them that they all have a sweetheart in there life, who they can share the problems, beeing there for each other when they are feeling down, someone who cares for me them when they are sick.And I need to do all of this on my own, while having depression, anxiety, sucking at the job and struggling to keep everything together. Now I am lying sick here and wishing for nothing more than someone is here.Every problem is crashing down, how I am unable to have a relationship, unable to manage my job, unable to manage my depression. Crying all day. I wrote so my bad things to my friends blaming her that she does not understand how I feel because she always have her guy. That she does not know how lonley and hurt I am.I mean what can she do. She lives 300km away.Ugh I do not want to be mad, but there is not other feeling today. I am so angry at her and I know this is stupid but I cannot put this envy. I want also someone but I am not able through all the scars and mistrust. Something my therapist said need years to heal after what I gone through. I am nearly 30, I clearly can give up having someone like her guy in my life. And it hurts so much to know it.Damn I do not want to hurt her for something like thisShe is not mad she understands but how can I be so angry at her.Ugh I want this feeling to stop. I want to stop crying. Anger and Envy",0
"If someone tries to give me emotional support, I just feel like a burden, and it does not make me feel any happier if they do. And yet, I think a part of me desires to have other people be kind towards me. I feel like people should not try to help me because it is a burden on them to try and help: and it does not help me emotionally anyways. A part of me desires to experience the kindness of others, and another part of me feels that experiencing kindness will not do anything for me and is not worth the trouble. Any advice for me? Also, I do see a therapist, I just want to hear some other opinions I am confused about emotional support",0
"Friends steal from me and blame me for not trying to contact them. I try to get help but I cannot find any doctors near me. Its like the world wants to reject me.

I really do not see how my non-existence would affect anyone negatively except maybe feeling sad for some time which is normal, but ultimately they would be better off. I just do not see the use of me being here except sucking up resources that others need. I cannot find any real reasons to live so it makes it really hard to help myself.

But I stopped 4 different meds without the guidance of a doctor because I had no choice.The job I ended up taking is scheduling me every weekend, Saturday AND Sunday, so now I have no shared days off with my boyfriend. I have no friends here so now I spend my days off alone.I used to have hobbies, I was perfectly content alone, but now I do not enjoy anything enough for it to be worth the effort. Everything is too hard.I spend my lonely days off mindlessly scrolling social media. I am bored to death but I do not WANT to do anything.. nothing is appealing.I hate working, I hate these days off alone, I hate everything.

"I leave for a week vacation in less than 2 days and I am stuck in a severe depressive episode. Today I have just been so down. I have had no energy, felt but then also been very tearful at times. Hyper sensitive, bursting into tears after my partner made a comment I took harshly and I ran off and hid and ended up napping for 2 hours. Low appetite, ruminating thoughts, passive SI. This is so fucking annoying. I am about to be on the beach for a week and here I am crying and cannot bring myself to even pack my damn suitcase.I tried to get my doc to place me on Wellbutrin 4 weeks ago but they did not want to do it since I have been losing weight and am also on Adderall and Topamax. I cannot take an SSRI due to my poor history with them and I was really wanting to give Wellbutrin a shot. I am just feeling so shitty today. I know this will pass, but the past 5 days have been awful and I really wanted to feel more excited going into this time away. Vacation countdown, but battling a depressive episode",0

I would never snooped his phone before in all this time, but last night it was like an autopilot march to the gallows.I have not even thought about another man in about 20 years. All I ever wanted was him. All I can think about is giving birth and then bleeding myself out. I have been asking the baby to please hurry up so I can stop hurting. Now that is the only thing I want.

"Basically, for a while now i have been starving myself for days at a time. Not because of anything, I just want to feel like shit. I try to justify it with saying it is because i have no control or choice over the food i eat. That of course is bullshit since even though i have always hated the food, i used to eat it.It is a cycle of self hate. I stop eating because i hate myself, which fuels me to hate myself for creating made up problems and that leads to me starving myself and so on.It is impossible to stop and more and more things in my life are becoming this way.My family has been mad at me for ignoring them and being so shitty. And frankly, i do not care.My parent is a shitty parent and I despise them. I stopped caring about what they think. Now i just ignore them and never talk to them. They act like they love me but they look down on my problems expecting me to be their therapist but not vice versa. They keep on saying they are my best friend but all they are, is a middle aged child who birthed someone into a poverty ridden toxic enviroment expecting them to grow up and support them physically and mentally not expecting their own child to be in need of help. One last thing, they keep on making fun of my mental problems and poking fun at them and telling me to just kill myself.Sorry for going so off topic.

I feel like after all the years of depression putting me so close to death, the last time being very close was March, my brain is rotting away and so is my soul. I am afraid my girlfriend is going to leave me soon and does not like being around me. I do not blame her Me and my dad are done speaking, if I see him we avoid eye contact. I have so many problems but the part that makes it hurt most is that it does not matter I am not allowed to be sad or feel these things. I cannot afford to.

She hates me, blocked me and I find that to be understandable but the thing I also hate myself for putting her in that situation. I apologized countless times and did not get any type of closure. I am so sorry to her and the guys reading this but I cannot carry around this guilt anymore I feel guilty",1
"I have just had to cut off an extremely close personal friend because of his abusive tendencies. coming to terms with the fact that hes a bad person has been so unbelievably difficult. i feel so alone now, and I am wondering if anyone else would ever even love me. I have been searching for a lifelong friend my whole life, i moved around a ton and i never got along with my family when i was younger so i never had anybody i could share my life with and i thought i found someone who i could and it turns out i cannot. I have been struggling with depression for a while now and the only person i could lean on pushed me away and hurt me. I am so alone and i do not know what to do. I am not contemplating suicide but i feel like I am dying I am at the end of my rope.",0
"I really do not understand why I find myself here, suicide is not something I have ever attempted, but it is something I have considered and started considering more and more as time goes on now that I have graduated college.The worst part is I do not think I have any good reason to do it. I am successful in a very well-paying career. I am fairly smart and can apply myself. I am not hot by any means but I am attractive enough to have fairly good options on the dating apps (more on this later). I have a loving, if not smothering family (also more on this later), and a good amount of close online friends and some IRL friends that I still talk to online. I have long-term goals for myself that I want to see happen. It may seem that I have no right to be here, and fuck maybe I do not, but I am still absolutely fucking miserable and some days I wonder why I have not blown my brains out yet. Today's one of those days, for some reason.It really just comes down to my inability to form intimate relationships. I do not really date anymore, for me to be close enough with someone and like them enough to have sex with them is rare since moving back home. I also still live with my extremely obsessive parents in a pretty remote area which makes meeting new people super difficult. All of this leaves me feeling so isolated and behind from everyone, and I am terrified to make any change in my life that could somehow fuck me up worse than where I currently am. Yeah I could afford to rent somewhere but what if that ends up making me more lonely while also burning thousands a month?Work keeps me occupied but the thoughts of ""you are never going to meet someone, get married, have a family, be successful outside of working a 9-5 job, what is the point of you still being here, you will never find more friends and just like some of your college ones the rest will disappear as time goes on"" are getting more and more frequent. it is something I have considered",1
"it is hard to explain but I am not even sad enough to be upset. I am...well regularly ready to hang myself, have the instructions handy in case, and just so fundamentally tired.

"Hi everyone... I am a 19f and I have been depressed and anxious since I was around 13. I also have OCD and ADHD. My life has been pretty fucking shit the last year and half or so like everyone else, but the last month in particular has just been throwing one punch after another at me. I have been suicidal in the past, but nothing like this. Despite being in therapy and finally deciding to try meds again (tried 3 different ones at 15 and all made me worse but I am trying another out of desperation), I have never been this close to actually attempting to harm myself. Point is, I know I need help. Badly. What I am doing now is not enough. So naturally I thought I might benefit from staying in a mental hospital. But I have heard and read such incredibly mixed reviews on whether it is actually harmful or helpful. I am in Massachusetts, USA if that helps anyone have an idea of the type of care around me. But I am worried about being disconnected from the world for an unknown amount of time especially while I am trying to get a job. I am also gluten free for health reasons (but not allergic) and have a lot of stomach issues (I am low fodmap and acid too) and I am worried about being able to have half decent food that works with my restrictions. I do not know what they would confiscate from me there so that I can know what to leave at home. I also do not know what I can bring for comfort like my own pillow and blankets? I do not know how much privacy I will get. Things like that. I have done some research, but cannot find much in depth.If anyone could share their experiences especially if they went to one in MA I would be incredibly grateful. Because having to make this decision with very little idea of how it would actually pan out is just bringing up more anxiety for me which I really do not need. Not sure if I should admit myself to a mental hospital or not (TW)",0

I have tried pretty much every treatment/solution you can think of including accutane, and although my face is pretty clear (for the most part), my body acne just does not go away. ever. I have tried dozens of different products, tips, and been to multiple dermatologists and nothing takes it away. it makes me furious to see girls that can wear revealing clothes comfortably and naturally while I cannot because nobody wants to see acne. Its not attractive to anyone. I cannot be intimate bc I am too insecure about it. And it never goes away. What reason do I have to live? my acne is making me want to die",1

I have a bf and a loving family but seeing them no longer brings me joy either. but i want to know if i should visit a doctor and get on medication or should i just wait it out for a few more months. not worth it",0

Life just was not cutout for me, I was an imposter that should have been dead Long ago. Honestly, I felt as if I should not be alive, y'know? I just had this feeling inside me that said ""hey, what are you doing? You should be dead right now, do not you know that?"" I was not living life I was just going through the actions of life. I am not sad. I do not feel bad. I feel nothing. You should not be said either, it is not going to make that much of an impact. Just donate my body to science because it would be easier. I would hate for you to go into debt planning a funeral or cremating me. Also it would be pretty cool to be donated to science, other people can survive from my harvested organs, so it is a win-win for everyone. There is also the possibility of the government using my body for explosion tests or something, that would be pretty cool too. Anyway, I love you all very deeply and hope that you understand. This is not meant to hurt you, it is just easier this way. P.s. do not let anyone Photoshop me into those stupid ass clouds or I will haunt you. Also make sure you all have a good picture for my obituary, or I will also haunt you for that. Sincerely, Hey (suicide note stupid rant)",1

"2020 really amplified the issues in my marriage. My husband finally came clean and let me know he would been hiding and addiction from me for years. My constant loneliness and depression finally made sense- he was unable or unwilling to be there for me while he was using. He started his recovery and we started couples therapy again, but things remained stagnant.On top of all the issues, we were not intimate anymore. He told me he was not attracted to me because I had gained weight. That was brutal to hear. I reconnected with an ex at the end of 2020. I shared my problems with him and he listened. He told me I was beautiful and that my body was perfect to him. I ate it up.. an affair was born.Yesterday my husband confronted me- he would gone through my phone and seen messages with my ex. He was devastated.. packed up and left. I have been a mess. I cannot function, I cannot eat, cannot go too long without the sharp pain in my heart. Our relationship was filled with toxicity, but I want him back more than anything. I feel so lost and abandoned. We face timed last night and the pain in his eyes killed me. I realized I am grasping onto the idea of a relationship that never was. I am so scared of starting over. I hope he reaches out and asks that we try to work it out, but part of me feels that I should not even if he did. Please help- I am codependent and my separation is tearing me apart.

"I(18 yrs. old, M) started feeling this kind of feeling when I was in Junior High School. Every time a certain part of life gets harder, I lose my motivation to accomplish and I am having self-doubts if it is actually worth it to waste my energy to complete something. I feel like I cannot achieve my dreams. its hard to appreciate life and enjoy living.I am Obese, Shy, Insecure and Always Anxious. I noticed that I am easily irritable as the years go by. I will be become a Freshman College student this school year and I am so worried about my future. Its getting hard to wake up. I wish that I could sleep forever, so that I could never worry about the future and responsibilities. Responsibilities. Whenever I was given a hard responsibility, it is hard to meet their expectations. It stresses both my body and mind. Ever since I started feeling unmotivated and depressed, I just let myself go with the flow. The concept of love and romance to me is....nothing. I just..do not care about making a relationships anymore. The feeling of being myself alone is just what keeps me going. I am always having thoughts about why am I still alive?, suicide, someone/something killing me, accidents that will kill me, anything that will kill me. I am always begging to GOD to ""just take me already"" whenever I was having a mental breakdown due to stress, how people( like my parents) are disappointed to me, making a mistake(even a small one). I am so afraid of failing. Every I time i fail, i feel unmotivated, apathetic to anything.The only things that keep me going are surfing the internet, playing games, listening to music and reading books. I hate reading books when I was a kid but during Junior high school, I come to appreciate how fantasy books are. Fantasy Books gives me a feeling of freedom. Whenever I read these kind of books, I always insert myself as the MC, thinking what would if I was the MC. The only things that are interesting to me are entertaining video(I always stream on YouTube), fantasy books(mostly isekais, light-novels). i always wished that the our VR Technology would advance just like Sword Art Online. Create worlds that I want to live in.How to get rid of this feeling? How do I motivate myself to keep on going?

"I just want to be happy and by myself. I never really learned how to talk to girls, but part of me is happy I did not. Both of my past relationships somehow happened, but a part of me hated being in them. I was always paranoid they were talking to other guys, or they lost interest in me. In the end, it did not matter cus they are both exs now. I just like being able to do whatever I want whenever I want. I can smoke or drink as much as I want and no ones going to be upset at me. I can play all the video games I want and I do not have to FaceTime anyone. I can hang out with anyone I want without worrying about beef between girlfriends.

"I feel like fucking Sisyphus, repeating the same cycle over and over again never making a single inch of progress.

As soon as I let one negative thought in, I am drowning within a day. I have been a complete and utter failure this year, moved out so I was not a financial burden on my family. But I am now costing them more than I was when I was living at home. I do not have any reason to feel this way, but I am just so tired of existing. I do not know what to do at this point, I have been struggling with depression since I was 12, going on 7 years now, self harm for about 6. But no matter how hard I try, every single day I think about cutting, or ending my life and I do not feel like Ill ever get a break. I always thought I would be dead by 18 and now that I have made it I do not know what to do. I do not see myself growing old, having a future, I have just always thought I was either going to kill myself or OD.

I trusted people they broke my trust now its difficult to open up or trust anyone, i have built these walls that i want to take down, but each time i break it it becomes bigger and bigger! I have no clue why am I even here and why am i writting this but i definetly need help, the longer i wait the longer I am drowning in my mind. As a kid I was sexually assulted and i have not told this to anybody and the longer i keep this inside me its killing me everyday. when I try to escape reality i get on social media and after i while i end up comparing myslef with others like why am i not making money? what am i going to do with life? That person is enjoying his or her life why cannot I? Why cannot i have anybody to love and after all this when i start to pain a little more i turn to drugs before it was just for fun but now it has become a daily routine to get stoned and numb the feeling.

I am hardly even eating, either I eat twice a day or sometimes even once a day and the best part is i do not even know why am i starving myself to death.

"I was kicked out of my house two months ago. Maybe I left it. I do not know. I got into an argument with my mother and as I was trying to leave my stepfather grabbed me and started to hit me. So I fought back. And my older sister was on his side, she helped him. I was barely bruised but I left because I knew that it would be deadly next time. And I am pretty sure I had no choice, because my mother was yelling about how crazy I was as I left. I first tried to move in with my father. We had not talked in 5 years except for one weekend. But that weekend went well and he told me he loved me and I thought that I was still his child so I thought I could go to him. But he told me he is not an escape. So I ended up staying with my best friend. Next year I graduate, but that is still a full year I have taking up her space. I cannot even get a job because I have no identification. I am going hungry some days because I do not want to ask for food because I know it is not my money and I am not their responsibility. Her mother's boyfriend is an alcoholic. He gets drunk and he yells and gets violent and I am afraid that one day he is going to remember that I exist and he is going to remember that I am trans and he is going to remember that he is homophobic. I do not know what to do about college. I am very good at school so I should get into a good college but I do not know how to fill out the applications with no information about my parents. My school told me I do not have to worry about that for the FAFSA, but they have not said anything about actual college. I just feel so alone. I want someone to talk to and someone who cares. there is nobody I can tell all of this to. My best friend knows, and she is wonderful. But she is not the kind of person to comfort others and that is all I want. It' would be so much simpler to die. I do not matter to anyone. I feel like I have lost any hope of becoming a successful person. I do not know what to do anymore. It would be easier to just die.",1

"Well, not all entirely. I have a few dishes I still like to some extent or a few delivery spots but I am talking in general. Tasting food ranges from uh, its okay at best and wow, I feel stupid for eating this, it gave me no satisfaction and I just wasted money and health.Interestingly, my body seems to like foods I cannot eat out of health or preference reasons: Milk products. Absolutely anything with milk is usually to my liking but I should not be eating it. I am using gluten and lactose pills which help but sometimes do not. At worst I get the bloaty stomach but recently I have not been getting it even if Id eat something really milky. Meat. I am 105 pounds of weight and would like to stay there but without meat I do not feel satisfied. Sweets - my favorite thing to make is a sandwich with chocolate paste and banana on dark rye bread. I have had some people surprised by the speed at which I eat sweets, lol. And they rarely satisfy me unless its a good portion which is not good knowing my size. But here is the catch - often the same type of food product I used to like absolutely tastes like nothing to me. I think this thing with me loosing mood if I do not eat well is from my grandfather. I inherited a lot of his body issues. And as for being a snob, I guess its just my complex of a village bumpkin. Used to be in a village of third world country, then a city and now I am in a bumpkin area of a more advanced country.. possibly having to go back soon.

"To start, I am here because of relationship anxiety. I had posted recently about having immense anxiety about a girl I barely knew. Awesome girl. Very grounded, very sweet. But for some odd reason, chemistry somewhere down the way I had become infatuated rather quick. And then a certain unease crept in that felt like I was screwing up somewhere. within moments I automatically jumped to very negative affirmations that swirled in my head, day and night for the past two weeks. The ones that stick out: ""you are going to fuck this up, you are not normal, she will find out your issues and dip from yo crazy ass!!""Somewhere down the way, I deeply pondered at the last part. Life looking back was rather well....Childhood!!I had parents who had issues in their relationship on their own, let own their own individual demons. I acknowledge that they always did their best to make sure we were fed and had a roof over our heads. But a lot of things I felt I had to teach myself on my own. In the beginning life was okay, but after awhile it got tough for my parents way back. and certain choices were made then that led to exodus from Hawaii to the mainland. Things were the best we could make but they were not ideal. At some point in time, we slept in a car as a family.We never stayed in one place for longer than a year. always constantly moving since I was a kid, it practically never ended until I had gotten a place of my own. It did not with my parents anger issues, mother's narcissism, and my father's drinking and abuse. Still through it all, they stuck it out for us, but I wonder sometimes if that was a good idea...When both of my younger siblings were diagnosed with autism, both of my parents had gotten distant from me it felt. I completely understand, and a lot of it I give myself shit for it. But also my younger siblings have been sheltered too much as well. It was hard then as a kid to tell them that there was a difference between compromising and spoiling. We gave them no structure or guidance. After awhile, I was left with most of responsibilities of watching and raising my younger siblings, which are the memories I enjoy most in my life. Looking back now it was not all bad.The level of abuse between my parents ruined a lot of opportunities for us. Always hurting themselves, us, our possessions, fighting, relocating, separating, getting back together again, rinse and repeat. Lived through toxic before I knew what that meant. Ran away for the first time when I was 11 and went across the county almost. It became clockwork. because of the constant moving, I could never maintain friendships. And on top of that I was scared to bring friends around. To some degree it got to a point where we filed a false domestic violence report on my father (He actually was getting his shit together at the time) to get into a farm program and avoid sleeping on the street. Also a good time, learned Martial arts, did gardening. Another good time.Parents had gotten back together at some point in time before High School. Life was good for a bit, stable. Then the issues arose. I was having issues with my parents then and went out and hung out with the wrong crowd, was partying and drinking all the time, even skipping school. I graduated but barely. My graduation on the other hand, was finding out my mother was gambling addict and also was in part to ruining a lot of our prospects in life.I do not want to hold onto any of this against my parents. Now, they are still trying their best to survive, and they have changed over the years. But lately this surfaced too, and I have not felt well when I talked to my mother about this. She did not know what to say, and I began to be frustrated about it, but I realize now that she was not prepared to handle the issues I was going through, and she was trying her best. Its still upsetting when she does not remember anything she has done wrong. But I need to move on, I love my mother and I only have one. No matter how batshit crazy she is.I love my dad, we are okay, we hang out, have lunch every once in awhile, and he is conscious of his actions. But he still has a lot of work to do. But I am proud of how far he is come. I love you Dad.Adulthood!!! (the super condensed version)Right after graduation was a shitshow. Lost the place, me and pops split. ended up in a shelter for a year and a half. Dad came here from a different country under extreme circumstances I do not want to get into, but frankly, he was prepared for life as much as I was. Went to community college while homeless. Got an apartment with other guys my age from the shelter. Then realized alcoholism was genetic. Fucked off my responsibilities. Split. Went upstate to stay with my mother. At the time I realized she was up to same tricks, which led to a lot of fights between us and eventually she stole from me and kicked me out. stayed with a girl next door, first relationship, then left me for the father of her baby (I was still fucking off my responsibilities then) and subsequently back on the street.moved around from place to place. Met another girl, fell in love, but she had major depressive disorder and schizo. after a year, the relationship took a turn for the worst. She began to be emotionally abusive and always kicked me out. I did my best, but at the end of the day, we have come to terms that she never actually loved me. She went into another relationship a couple weeks later. But I fell hard.Interesting part: COVIDI moved back the other side of the state to stay with my dad. The place he had for me was a clean and sober house ran by a slumlord. Then COVID hit the states. I was quarantined in a horrible place, post breakup, living with my dad who was emotionally abusive. I could not handle it. I got my shit together got a job at the hospital and got my own apartment!!!NOW....Been doing everything I needed to. Kept up with bills, work out every day, eating healthy, drinking less. Then I met this girl. Same birthday, independent, very grounded. And now everything came back. Now my anxiety is becoming debilitating in certain areas. I am becoming more irritable, although a lot of that is from the shortcomings of the healthcare industry. But if this is going to become a thing I need in dealing with this anxious attachment style. I have pushed away my remaining friends because of my last relationship, and I am starting to push everyone else away right now. Either way if you made this far, thanks for taking the time. I know I am better than this and I know I can be better than this. I just wish I did not mess this up with her just to learn. Frankly I just wish things like this did not happen just for a learning lesson. Feels like the purpose of my life is just to be an example. do not be like this guy. I just want to be happy, and honest. I try to do the right thing in anything I do, and I try to help people as much as I can. But why I cannot be happy or trust other people? Why cannot I just be happy?Wishing I could time travel now.....&amp;#x200B;Try your best, because everything else is easy. Always do the right thing. Goodwill will always be paid forward. Finding closure in my crazy life, To pursue true happiness within myself",0
"I do not know if I have any real mental illness since I never have been diagnosed, but ever since my parents got divorced, and my big sibling bellitled me, I always feel very down. I strive to get good grades in school so I can be ""successful"" according to my parents, but now I am thinking that successfulness is not about that, and that it is about happiness. I probably would not be happy working some long job as a hedge fund manager where I get home and barely any time to do anything, so all the money I get would be useless.As days passed my mind keeps telling me more frequently bad things. I tried to kill myself and survived. it is not even what I want to do, because I do not want to go to hell, or be punished , or be in pain, etc, but more and more often, I find myself wanting to hurt myself.Now, most days i do not want to get out of bed and move or do anything. I just want to sink into the bedsheets and then disappear into the ground. Anyone else feel like this? Now, I just feel like lying down on the floor forever",1
People actively avoid me. No one will hire me. No one likes me. People do not invite me to things or acknowledge me. If I tell someone happy birthday with a Facebook post they will delete my post because they are ashamed to be seen interacting with me. I have been bullied my entire life.I do not belong. People are ashamed and embarrassed of me including my family. I am hated or avoided before I even open my mouth. This world will not give me a chance. I am excluded from regular society. People hate me for being autistic,1

"My life is worthless.I have done everything I can, to be the best I could. But demons chase me in my nightmares. In the back of my head, I stuff them into dark rooms in my mind, but their darkness bleeds out and corrupts my heart.I know people are good. I see beauty in everyone that opens their heart before. Friend, family, partner....There is beauty in all, and I pour love. I sacrifice my heart and my life, to give my everything to see others built up. I commit to giving 25% of all income to the helping and building up of others. I carry 5's in my car at all time for the homeless. I almost always stop for the people walking on the side of the highway. I could tell you the names and stories of several of the homeless in this city, because I used to spend my time sitting with them, giving hugs, and rides. I love and cherish others.And I am alone. I have always been. This lastest abandonment is my own damn fault too. I fell in love with a married woman. I would not have, except that her marriage was one in which she was neglected and abused. And I took up the mantle of loving the gorgeous depths of her heart. But the facade came down, and the victim ran back to her abuser. That one is on me.But the only person to actually see me, and love me, and not leave, died after 5 short years.The relationship before, fell apart because she was emotionally abusive. She could not be wrong, would shift blame, and use guilt to avoid having to admit fault over anything serious. When I finally confronted her, she left.I am not a perfect person, I do not hold any doubt that I am my own ball of wax. But I am self-sacrificing and other-focused. I can see and take responsibility for my failures and Absolutely give my life to always bettering myself. My sole ambition is to be the best man, and best potential husband, for the woman I assumed was walking on this earth, waiting for me to find her.Yet all my efforts are for naught. I search and search and put myself out there in so many ways, yet connections are few, and the ones that do form, fade away quite rapidly.My one fear is that I am unlovable. And I am walking down the dark streets in my mind that led to two previous attempts on my life. But the difference between then and now, is I live in a city that you could be shot for just walking down the street at night.Now I spend 17-22 hours a day, just trying to find something to do, someone to talk to, still searching for someone to love my desolate, worthless soul. My heart yearns to leave the dark streets of my mind, and take the last walk I would ever walk, down into darkness. It will not take long now.I do not want to die. I want the pain to end. I walk the path of destruction again.",1
"I just do not know what I can do anymore. I am completely alone. I always have been. I am 17, and have dropped out of school because of depression, and while I have recovered enough to have a job, almost no one who works there is my age. I cannot join any clubs (due to the whole dropping out thing.) Now, all this would not be so bad if I was able to start a conversation with anyone ever. Once someone starts talking to me, I can have a conversation with them just fine, but that rarely ever happens. I have so much anxiety about starting a conversation, and no clue how to fix things.All I want is to not be alone in life, but it seems completely impossible. Loneliness",0
"I have been crying in bed for like the past 3 hours listening to Phoebe Bridgers bc depression wanted to hit me like a fucking truck this morning and ruin my day. I have been struggling with a lot recently, eating disorders, self harm, depression, trauma, and so on. This fucking sucks. I just want to be able to function. I want to be able to shower and wash my hair every goddamn day instead of getting stuck in bed because everythings meaningless. And I want to be able to shower in general without having to use it as an opportunity to cry without worrying about being heard. I want to be able to eat without feeling like a failure. I want to feel like I am worth something. I do not want to have to ward off temptations to self harm every single fucking time something goes wrong. I want to stop disappearing and ghosting all of my friends for weeks because I feel like they deserve someone better than me. And I want to stop thinking about all the bullshit I have been through and blaming myself. I am just so tired of this. I do not want to feel like this anymore, but I do not know how. I have been in and out of therapy for years and its never helped, I have been on an array of meds and its never helped, hell I have even tried my hand at self medicating with some not so great things, and I think it goes without saying that that did not work either. I just feel so fucking hopeless and like this is going to be a daily struggle for the rest of my life and I do not want it. I fucking hate feeling like this",0

"Please for the love of god someone interact with this. I know it is not healthy but I really need it. I have been living and working these past few years in the Hopes that eventually things will be solved. What things you ask? Well I will list them off here really quickly.1. Hate my body, everything about it from my face to my stomach to my dick. Everything is the exact opposite of everything I want it to be and it IS impossible to change.2. I am going to die someday and all I have ever done will be rendered meaningless.3. I do not love things like everyone else does. I do not love real people and the people I do love I cannot be with because they are not real.For years and years I have been living life off of the belief that these problems will have a solution. I have done the liberty of listing the solutions as well.1. Maybe far off in the future I will be able to switch bodies through brain transplant to something I want. Maybe I will be able to construct a robotic body of my own.2. Maybe someday they will make a way to become immortal, or find a way to resurrect the long dead. And I will be able to continue enjoying the life I have loved so much.3. Maybe even further off in the future they will invent a way to travel through dimensions, and I will be able to be with someone I really love.I have believed these things, really I had hope. But I have had it thrown in my face. I have been told everything I have hoped for, everything I ever wanted is impossible. I do not want my life to end, I love it so much. But it is going to end and I cannot sleep knowing that it will. I cannot do anything knowing that everything I have ever wanted is impossible. I cannot live knowing this.

"My boyfriend broke up with me (although he calls it a break). He and his other boyfriend are moving in together at the end of August, which leaves me with nowhere to go and no one to turn to.

That plus two previous suicide attempts, and who realistically thought I would make it to 34?Honestly, the bottle of sleeping pills in my bedside table looks pretty good right now.

"about a month ago they kicked me out. i was venting some frustration (alone, in my own room, without involving them) and i yelled and stuff. and i guess they did not know how to handle it so they kicked me out. they were also going on about how they want to live with a housemate who is friendlier and more interactive and I am too unsociable I guess, and they tried to convince me to move out for my own good. eventually i gave in because it got pretty clear that they did not want me around anymore. I am staying with my parents now and will go to my college dorms in fall. But I really cannot stop thinking about it. I am still not even clear on why they made me leave, they said a lot of conflicting stuff. I have always been bad at relating to other people but this really hammered home the fact that I am never going to fit in anywhere. I am never going to be comfortable no matter who I am with or where I go. not to mention how hard it is to get and keep a job when you are this bad at socializing. i cannot even do a proper interview.

So now I do not see her anymore, and I have a terrible job that is keeping me in physical pain. I got depressed, who the fuck would not?So I withdrew, and at the same time so did she. We had our spats and then she came and asked permission to sleep with someone else. All the self assurance I had in my marriage that my life would EVENTUALLY be okay because I still had her disappeared (I said no).Then she cheated on me. Said that she did not have a companion anymore. I understand that. I cannot forgive her yet, but I understand. Same day I found out though, I find out my grandfather has cancer. I do not have many role models, he is one of them.he is gone now, and I almost left my wife for space away from her. I did not do it. I decided that my marriage was more important than her infidelity. That our relationship was worth being hurt over because we could fix it.Now she still wants to sleep with other people. I feel worthless. That my marriage is not worth anything because some stupid fantasy is more important.I have no friends here. I have some people I game with and some of them know what is going on. I have no family here. I have no couch to crash on when I am hurt.I am just so tired. I think about walking out in the middle of the road so that I am not killing myself so to speak.

I want to enjoy the peace and quiet and at the same time I want to go back to normal, and work on the stuff I like, finish some games, talk with friends...Because it is getting kind of rare these moments my brain just do not go full die mode, I am so afraid to not just enjoy the moment or to do something productive.

Everything I do goes wrong. If I breathe in, some bad thing happens in my environment. Fuck that. My entire life is a failure and I cannot take it any longer. I do not care about anything anymore so I will just leave a note why my entire life sucks. Doubt anyone will read anyway.I am ugly as fuck. I was born too early and I am extremely short. If I eat more than 1 meal a day I gain weight. that is why I am slowly becoming overweight. Even people who pass me on the street call me ugly. I am an adult and my body stopped aging around puberty. Guess how fucking miserable I look. I have not smiled for the last 15 years probably. Most of my friends abandoned me and if I want something from them it is always me to contact them. I do not have any special talents. Had to run away from home to be able to move out. Did wageslave jobs that resulted in permanent back pain and back/bladder issues. Every minute on the toilet is painful as fuck. I spend the entire day in front of my pc and the back pain is so strong that I need extremely strong painkillers that are almost like drugs at this point. When I take them everything feels like I am on a drug trip and I start to enjoy it but I am useless for the rest of the day. Alcohol also makes me feel good but I cannot always afford it. I will never be able to have a relationship anymore because my first boyfriend abused me and locked me in his home, my first girlfriend cheated on me with my ex boyfriend. I cannot even watch porn anymore because PTSD kicks in. Horrible right? And recently I realised that I am trapped in the wrong gender very likely. If I look in the reflection in the mirror I do not feel like it is me. I do not even know what I am at this point. I thought everything would be better if I join uni but I keep fucking up my minor. I am below average in my major and can pull through but my minor fucks me. I failed at least 2 classes each semester and if it would not be for covid I would have already been kicked out. I am now taking a minor class for the third time and I still got 0 points in the mock exam. I fucking suck. I hate myself for going this way. I feel like a fucking retard doing a class three times. And this is supposed to be a freshman class. It will only get harder. My uni however has finally given me the chance to escape this cruel world. I get to study abroad and they pay the tution fee. This is my chance. In 2 months I will fly to a different country, quit all my insurances so you cannot take me back! I will probably cut my veins in a public toilet and die a miserable death. Nobody will find out if I have died because everyone excepts me to be gone for 6 months. My death will never be announced to them because I am in a different country. Because I will burn all my public documents, nobody can identify me. I will be missing in action forever. it is only these 2 last months and after that I am finally free. I just need to pull it off. Just 2 more months and I can finally leave this world forever. do not mind my short rant.",1
"The title says it. I am a young adult, definitely not a kid anymore, and I never had a childhood in a sense that I internalised my parents' helicoptering behaviour that avoided any type of slightly risky situations. I was the best of my class, a really nerdy kid (then the best of my group at college), never had friends in the neighborhood, never actually had just any friends. Never went out to play with anyone, never had any sleepover parties or anything. Being a kid sucked big time, my peers were always so loud and rude and cruel, while I was apparently cold and arrogant and always acted like a know-it-all and an ""adult"". I just wish I returned back and did everything differently. I hate myself for being how I am and for not having any experiences or memories apart from sitting in front of the PC days long. Mom worked, dad left, so no-one could really tell anything was wrong apparently.I was always so focused on imaginary success that I was obsessively trying to be the best in the class (not to gain any actual knowledge, important distinction). Now being an adult, I am expected to get a job by my parents, while all I can do is sit on a couch all day remembering every small bad thing that has happened over the course of my life. I have lost all enthusiasm for working hard and being successful just at the moment I am actually expected to become like that. I wish it all ended, but I know I am too cowardly to take my life, I had an attempt before, basically barely scratched my arms, now my mom blames me for ""doing that to her"" and she complained about having arythmia when she accidentally learned that I did it again recently. So I cannot even let it out like that. I wake up and go to bed thinking about it all, and I do not see any solutions. I do not even know if I am just making everything up bc of not wanting to work and to grow up, I was not horribly abused, neglected or whatever, idk. Maybe I am just trying to find a reason to blame my parents for being a failure. Do with that confession as you will :/ I desperately want to become a child again, but this time, to actually act like one",0
"my relationship is over but we are still living together and sharing a bed. it hurts so badly and i cannot get over the pain. this just happened and i keel thinking i need to get out or escape or get a new apartment, by i cannot stop thinking that if i just kill myself before that shoe drops then everything will be so much easier. i will still have my relationship and my life and my happiness, in theory. but the reality is i just cannot deal with any of this and with feeling so alone. i feel like my whole life has been shattered and the one person i want to turn to is not only the one who broke it but has moved on and left me alone to collect the pieces.my depression was already creeping back but i am so tired. i have been fighting for so long and i cannot keep doing this. i am tired. i do not know how to be alone",1
"Because I get no joy out of it anymore. And I get no joy out of life anymore. It is all too much of a struggle. I have told some stories and contributed some things and they will probably even last a little while into the future. Soon my work will be done, and I will be able to say goodbye. I am an artist with some recognition and my work continues to make money. I think in a year I will kill myself and just leave my work for everyone to remember me",1
"I have been through too much shit to list, but the most important thing is I have binge eating disorder that has gained me 70 pounds which makes me want to kill myself, and I feel zero pleasure from literally anything and have not for years. I used heroin for 20 days straight (no longer using) to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days, and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged. This means no leaving my room, interacting etc for a week at least, and I have two very important family things I am canceling in a few minutes. How do I get my family to push me to suicide? I cannot do it on my own. How do I make them push me to finally do it?",1
I feel like the only way to apologize for my actions is to take my own life. I feel like everyone is against me even my online friends I known for 2 years. I know that they really would not abandon me. I feel like I would be at peace when I am dead I thought the drama was over. I had been drowning in my own sorrow for I do not know how long. I decided to take a break. I cannot do this anymore. Everything feels like a lie to me. I feel like I am wasting away slowly,0
"What do you do when you have no money to afford food or bills because your measly $500/mo ssi check is gone, cannot get a job because disabled, have to live with abusive parents? Have no money for any of my personal bills or a vehicle. I do not know what to do. I need a reason to keep on keeping on. No friends or supportive family, so I cannot ask people to help me out. Any advice? Life keeps kicking me down",1
"I have been fantasising about my own suicide for a while now, maybe 2+ years (I am 15). they used to be more like an idea in my head, like in some weird dream world or in a fictional place or something. and the end felt figurative and it was just like falling asleep peacefully and never waking up.these days they are getting more and more realistic, like in my bedroom with a bottle of pills i know where to get, or carbon dioxide poisoning with the burner in the kitchen cupboard. the pain with ending my life is becoming more and more real, and it keeps appearing in my dreams too.i have never meant to act on the fantasies but last night i felt really impulsive, and something my friend said deeply disturbed me, and i had a really strong urge to harm myself or run away from home or take a bunch of pills, any pills. i think i had a panic attack and i calmed myself down by cutting but it was scary how strong the urges were.sorry just wanted to rant lifes being a bit rough. fantasies are getting more realistic",1
"I got out of rehab not too long ago for alcohol. It was my second time to rehab and I have been in inpatient around 6 times. I quit drinking for awhile but I went back to it. It ruined my relationship and my ex lives in Michigan. I just want to drown myself in alcohol but it causes panic attacks now and I feel like I have nothing. I am drowning by myself. Literally no friends, no one I regularly talk to, nothing. I applied for this job doing something I am experienced in because I have been unemployed for awhile. I walked out on my last two jobs due to manic episodes. Anyway I did 3 days with the company and was suppose to have a second interview. It all went very well. I had all the experience I needed to be a crew chief and I was so excited. I told everyone about it and how Ill be making 80k/yr. I thought it all went so well. I just got an email telling me they are not considering me for the role anymore. I am absolutely crushed. I just want to die. I do not know what to do. Just got denied the job I thought I had in the bag, I have relapsed and I just want to end it.",1
The world felt less complicated when I was depressed and stuck in bed and in my own head. Idk,0

"I am done. I want to end this shit NOW. I cannot take it, I find that the things that I enjoy are berated by others and it hurts. Eh, I guess those things are not really that enjoyable anyway so its whatever. But nobody gives a shit what I think. I get no real support from anyone and its because I am absolutely unvalueable. I am the last person on their minds even though I try to say and do the right things. Nothing works and nothing gets better. Its always the people who I have talked to who end up happy with the last laugh.I will always be seen as potentially dangerous because of the examples of the many men before me. I will always be seen as a loser because I simply cannot compete with the billions of others out there who could easily replace me at any time. I will always feel lonely because no one wants to be around someone like me who mentions anything from this post. do not take what I say the wrong way, I am not blaming anyone else. I am not angry at anyone in particular. Its just about time I stfu and accept that I will always be unwanted. That other people will always have another someone who would they rather be with. That the negatives in life will always outweigh the positives. So no, I do not want to wait any longer than I have to to see what happens in the future. I KNOW my future, so do what you have been doing and leave me alone. I want this to be my final message before I am gone. Know that I am through trying to make new relationships and connections. Know that I am cutting ties with preexisting ones so they will not find out. Know that my parents would not care that much. Know that I have tried. I am done with life's bs, it does not even want me to be alive anyway so why did I bother even reaching out here in the first place? I do not care anymore honestly. It never leads to anything. I am too tired to do anything right now tho, I hope to one day have the courage and energy to have this be over lest I end up being 30 with many more issues. I want this to be my final message before I am gone.",1
It only ever happens when I am reading or writing. It is this numbing escape in which my insecurities and doubts do not exist. I forget the worlds flaws and create a place in which they do not exist. Allas I am brought back to the sobering reality and am left imprisoned by my flaws. When I am away from reality I can imagine a life worth living.,0
"First time poster so excuse my grammar and format...I met my wife about 3 years ago, fast I know but I was so happy. I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter, I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool. I think I need to be medicated...but I just cannot afford that kind of thing right now, let alone set professional help.Anyway...I just wanted to rant/vent...thanks Venting-I lost everything I ever wanted due to my own mistakes",0
"I always feel so potently the difference between what I want and what I have. I know if I could not desire anything I would not be depressed. But that is not possible - that is what drives humans on. So even when I improve in aspects of my life, I am never content as there is always a 'better'. I can literally think back to every moment, every interaction and every relationship and think how I could have done better. Now I am depressed and I can feel relationships crumbling around me as I try to balance them with my mental health. And, of course, most people do not really care about your mental health - they care about the side of you that appeals to then (which is not you depressed). I feel like my life is drifting by and I am just a spectator and cannot affect anything. If I never wanted anything I would never be sad",0
"I am stuck with my family and they are horrible, I do not have any friends, I have adhd and my life is in shambles, I just want to give up on life because everything is fucking ugly and I have immense hatred for the world, there is not a day when I do not feel despair, not a day when I wake up feeling good and happy for another day, I just want to fuck off from this world full of motherfuckers I need a reason to live, I am merely pushing through and fighting so hard to live, I think suicide is the only way out of this suffering",1
"As a brief background, I know I have had depression for many years (I am 21 now) but the last year or so has been constant. I also self h*rm quite regularly (not really badly tho). I know many people suffer worse than me but I feel like I have gotten to the point that I would consider doing something about it to stop it getting really bad. But that terrifies me.I have terrible social anxiety and cannot even tell my mum (she is involved in stuff so it would be hard to discuss things too). But I really want to tell my best friend I have had since primary school. We do not see much of each other anymore since she went to university but she is back home for the summer and I have invited her to a concert and to sleep over at my house after. I think it will be good for me to have some company for once. I trust her 100% and know she would be sympathetic (and maybe she is even had depression too). I just find it so hard to bring things up when I know it could make them feel awkward and I do not want to put a downer on the weekend. But I know if I do not say something now I will never tell anyone. I was thinking of telling her after the concert when we are chatting before going to sleep as you always do on a sleepover. I just do not know how to bring it up or what to say. I do not want it to sound attention seeking either. I am not expecting her to do anything, I just want someone to know. Advice needed about opening up",0
"I have dealt with chronic depression from a very young age, I am currently 31yrs old. There have been times in the past where I though I was as bad as I could get. Felt that hopeless despair and apathy. Rock bottom.The depths to which my depression could truly sink was discovered two weeks ago. There was no catalyst for this change, everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression, that suicide was never an option, not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong. Thinking of family and loved ones no longer steers me clear of this option. This is truly a scary place to be, and I fear I am losing myself entirely. I do not know what I am looking for here, perhaps just a place to speak my peace. Much love reddit, stay strong. My chronic depression has recently transformed into something far worse than its ever been.",0

"So, my birthday is coming up soon, and just like every year, I am dreading it. it is one of the worst days of the year for me. it is also one of the days that I think about dying the most. Not necessarily through suicide but by any means, like, freak accidents, accidental overdose, just anything that will end my life. Nothing ever happens, but sometimes it makes me wonder what would happen if I did die. How would it affect my loved ones?Has anyone ever lost someone close on that person's birthday, and how did the passing of this person affect you and the other people close to him/her? I am mainly looking for people who died by their own choice, but if it was due to other causes you can still comment. I, like many others here, want the pain to end but do not know if I can go through with it if it will hurt those around me.please only post if you feel comfortable. Ending it on a birthday",1
"I was diagnosed with it early in life, but I have always dealt with it. Just as I have gotten a bit older, it seems to have become a more constant, more permanent fixture to my existence.In the past, you could maybe attribute it to this or that, like bad luck or even substance abuse. Or even the loss of friends and/or family or other traumatic events, but I am years-past such events and I have better habits now. Plus, out of sheer necessity, I kind of remobilized myself and even got an excellent job again at the start of the year. Something I am good at, that I can do well. So, I cannot really ""work on"" those aspects anymore. I am legit in all that again. it is like I made it somewhere, but it changed nothing internally.But things I do, none of it changes my utter lack of feeling. My total disinterest in life. No matter the changes I make, things that would be considered (and are) positive, do nothing to elevate my mood and general outlook on life. Whether I am in elite physical condition again or not, or earning good money or not, none of it really helps. It feels really nice to be able to buy something for someone I care about, but every time I get paid, it almost all just goes to my savings. Like, I just have no real motivation or ambition. it is like a burnout or something, like just being so worn out from carrying great responsibility at times, for so long.I honestly cannot think of much to buy, that I really want. One of the last holdouts was video-games. I have always enjoyed them but lately, I do not really even feel motivated to do gaming of my own. Then the other day, a really sweet coworker of mine gave me a really nice compliment, but I just kind of smiled and felt kind of sad about it, for some reason. Like, I felt like it was wasted on me and that she would be better off devoting that energy to someone else.And yeah, I do have unhealthy, self-destructive thoughts that, at times, seem comforting. I try not to indulge them. it is all fairly dysfunctional at times. I disappoint myself here.It sucks too because I cannot give up. There is not one person on this Earth to whom I can run for support. everyone is gone, moved on, or I just blew it with them and they do not want anything to do with me. So, if I do not earn a check, I have nothing. I must continue and it is all just bleak at times, since I would really wish just to go somewhere far away, somewhere dark and isolated. Like a sanctuary for despair, which I hate to say.it is just a reality of my life and it kind of sucks that I have not been able to move past it much, despite accomplishing some great things recently. Rather, it seems more a part of me, more certainly, than before. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Just I would been carrying these thoughts for sometime now. Seems Like I will Never Be Rid of Depression",0

"So an old friend invited me to his farewell party, I normally do not get invites like this but he was going away to another country, to be honest we were never that close because we went to different Universities but I get along well with him. It was a dinner party and there were about 12 people there most were female friends of his girlfriend and like 3 guys, the whole night I felt so zoned out, I felt horrible that I was not being friendly or talking to the others but I felt so faded, the alcohol made it even worse. One of the guys remarked how I barely talked to anyone the whole night, I felt crushed, I gave the usual a xcuse of I am tired but it was difficult not to leave right away. I was the first to leave it felt like I was giving up officially, I came home and cried.. yeah a 22yr old dude cried after a party, I feel like I am just a loser and no matter how much I force myself I will always be a loser, I give up even trying anymore I am tired of it. I cannot even hang out with people, I feel like a broken person",0
I get really angry and suicidal because people see me as inferior to them. Like I am not good enough to be loved because I am seen as inferior in this social hierarchy where people like me are not wanted and seen as inferior to others. This is the reason I am so suicidal.

"I tried to end it all last night but it did not work. I just woke up today feeling high from all the drugs and alcohol I took . I am probably going to jail next month (1-4 years) for something I did not do but my lawyer wants me to accept the plea bargain. I just do not see the point in life anymore. I am only 22 but I just want to die. I have no friends and no hope of achieving anything anymore. I watched my older brother die of cancer last month and wish it was me instead of him. The universe is one fucked up place. Death is easy, unless you fucking want it :(",1
"My wife me the other day that it was tiring trying to get me excited for things. It was half a joke, since she was trying to get me excited for Christmas, but it hurt also. It should not hurt, she is not wrong, nothing gets a rise out of me. I have been miserable doing everything. Work, home, I am just blah about every everything. But hearing it affect her hurt a lot. I was watching Bojack, and Diane started taking antidepressants. I asked her if she thought I was depressed. She said yes. I asked her if she thought it was time for me to look into doing something about it, and she hesitantly said yes. So I do not know where to go now. Do I talk to a Doctor? Do I. Wed to talk to a therapist first? Where do I start when I am tired of being depressed? I am sorry for being tiring",0

Either way my death still will be, me self killed bc of the guilt that made me hate me Another one..",1
"Why is it so fucking difficult to get a job, I have tried for years and I still have no experience. I have been rejected in 3 interviews in this one week alone. What the actual fuck. I am getting sick and tired of this shit. My nonexistent confidence was shattered a long time ago because my stupid fucking ass cannot do a simple task like getting a job. My self-hatred is aggravated by the fact I cannot get a job and I spend most of the day absolutely miserable and wishing I would just not exist. I feel even worse because I paid 7k for a useless certificate that was supposed to help me! Not only that but I have a mark of distinction too! What am I doing wrong? The more I get rejected the more bitter I get. I feel fucking useless.The only thing that gets me through the day is my long distance girlfriend but she is not always around to talk and I do not want to bother her with my problems.

They took away my driver plates because they told me I was going out too much. I am 25 years old and going out a lot to them is me not being home 2 sometimes 3 days of the week. I have to work the rest because I have to save up to pay off my loans. I have been ideating a lot recently and I hate that I am. I almost died when I was 3 at Niagra Falls because I almost jumped into the waterfall. and sometimes I wish my uncle did not save me from the blissful sound of the white noise that would have enveloped me and took away all my future pain. My family is tearing me apart",1
"This is just a rant. I do not have anyone I can really talk to atm. Fun fact when you are depressed and overshare with friends they tend to stop contacting you. Anyways this line I have been riding for awhile is reaching an end. Today I found myself talking to my coworkers of all people about the best ways to commit suicide. Hell it was more of a cry for help I think but what do I know I am not a doctor. Idk the intrusive thoughts are one of the few things that actually give me a sense of comfort anymore. To be frank I might have a year, maybe two. I just cannot keep this up. I do not have anyone in my life and it seems like I am beyond repair. Those are just my thoughts though, then again I am mentally unwell. Like I said I just needed to put this out there because frankly I am sick of waking up everyday. I just want this to be over. Getting some stuff off the chest",1

If I stay alive, they will watch me crumple and waste away doing nothing.If I kill myself, they will be sad in the beginning but it will lessen as time goes on. Maybe even be a relief. Seems like a simple decision to me.Maybe this sounds obvious or silly, but it was a little epiphany to me.Opinions? The lesser of two evils",1

Successful in my career, a girlfriend, new apartment etc. still I am at the lowest I have probably ever been.. I am 21 but I have a plan for how to kms for the first time since I was 17 and I am ""worried"" of how close I am to actually doing it and how easy it would be, but I cannot do that to my girlfriend and family.

He was my best friend/confidant would call him everyday if I was out of town for work. A week after he died I was fired. So I took my dog Suka, sold everything I could and went out on the road. Ended up in Oregon. While surrounded by natural beauty and people who genuinely wanted to know me I just could not as I was in another dimension emotionally. Asjed for help form my Godmother in Arkansas. That was a mistake. Was literally asked by her (a social worker btw) if I was a retarded.... So because I have fucked over my family so many times nobody believes that I want/working on to be better. Back on the road.Ended up in Tulsa. Worked at a call center. Call center helps me get a place. Pandemic happens. Stuck in apartment being yelled at by people on a constant basis. I quit my job. Lose apartment. Asked for help from a cousin. Cousin has a roommate with three other dogs. Said roommate is a veteran. During a family get together with cousin in law coming back from deployment, the dogs get in a fight. Veteran roommate tackles my dog (old Shepard Husky mix) and less than a month later I had to have him out down. So in the last two and half years I lost two of my best friends. I lost everything. I live out of my truck once again. I have reached out to people but it is been a no go from them. One of them is still thinking about it but it is most likely going to be a no. I keep being told that I am worthy of a happy life. But everytime I work towards that the rug is pulled. Or I do something very stupid like quit a job. I am not worthy. The talents I thought I had have dried up. The relationships I thought I had have dried up. My patience has dried up. I am just screaming in a void. I do not have anywhere to go. I have nothing and I feel like nothing. No spouse no kids no dog no life. What am I doing here? I will not call the hotline. I do not want to be incarcerated. Because I am already living in a self made prison. I just cannot do this anymore. I do not want to this anymore. There is no hope for me. Right now I am just trying to decide between the revolver or the shotgun at this point. But I will probably do another self sabotage before it all ends. cannot do this anymore",1

I cannot take care of myself beyond taking medication in the mornings and dragging myself to appointments in the afternoon. I do not know whether Ill starve because I cannot get myself eat or break down from lack of sleep first. Or just speed things up myself.There genuinely is nothing to keep me afloat. I have no reason to be alive. I am not wanted or seen or cared for by anyone. I add nothing at all to the world around me. People avoid me because I am so depressed that I am a burden and annoyance to them. I am so brutally unhappy it hurts, and there is nothing I can do to change it. I am going to die. Depression is going to kill me and I am going to be just another statistic. I do not even care because not a single person will notice I am gone in the first place. I am just waiting for my depression to kill me at this point",0

"Any job I get, I end up working with people who scream at me and bully me until I am forced to leave. I cannot win a freaking crane game and wasted $400. I did not win anything. Oh yeah I do not have a job. cannot get one of those either, even after 300+ applications.Tagged along with my parents on vacation and it rained every single day, the whole entire week. Guess who gets to drive home (2 hours) in torrential rainfall and flooding? Me!Any relationship I ever had, people leave (friends or boyfriends) People dump me and never speak to me again, yet I do not do anything bad to anyone. No one even tells me the reason they up and leave.So nothing in life works out - yes I put in loads of effort - I feel like I am swimming against a dangerous current, kicking, thrashing, trying to fight and make progress but I am not getting anywhere. I have no one to help me, no one to throw me a life preserver. I obviously have no luck whatsoever, other than I do not have cancer but that is probably not far in the future.I just feel so pathetic. I feel like so many other people are skating through life - and yeah they all have their problems - but come on, is not my case pretty extreme? Over 300 job applications and no job? $400 on crane games and not 1 prize? Do I just SUCK at life? Seriously? Am I cursed? Funny one time when I was little, I thought I had an encounter with the devil (no one believes me and I understand) unless it was a dream but how do I remember it so vividly all these years? I hate it all. I want it to end because I am so TIRED. I am tired of trying so hard for so many years and never accomplishing anything. I feel like I try harder than most people who actually succeed. Yet I am just a freaking reject, loser, pathetic waste. No luck in life, nothing works out",0

"I am a trans woman who suffers from BPD, ADHD and severe anxiety. I feel like I just cannot go on. I have been suicidal since my teenage and i have attempted suicide twice. My last resort was starting HRT which made me significantly less miserable but since I am still ugly and my progress seems to have stopped after 2 years, I have no hope anymore. I do not think that i would be ever able to look at myself in the mirror and not want to throw up.I hate that I have adhd and bpd, these mental illnesses have ruined my life, not to mention the gender dysphoria which makes me cry every day. Sometimes i do not look at the mirror for days just to keep my sanity.I just cannot accept that i will look like this for the rest of my life, I cannot accept that nobody knows me as a woman but rather a predatory straight man. Just the other day my father said that I am transitioning to be able to have easier access to women and rape them. As a rape victim who was raped everyday at the age of 7 by my coach and later on by my classmates at high school, its so fucking unfair. I have internalized this fear and when around other women i just feel like I am occupying a space that is not for me and its wrong of me to be there. I am always afraid when I go out since I have been beaten up severely twice in the past and I am always sexually, physically and verbally harassed when I am out. I have lost almost all of my friends to transmisogyny and I am sure I will always be alone. The only people who want to date me are fetishizers who see me as an exotic creature between man and woman. I have never been able to find sb who does not see me like that.Nothing will change and I will always be in pain. So the wisest thing is to end things but i do not have the courage. Both times i attempted I chickened out. I am sure i will do the same again. But i cannot endure this hell anymore either. I feel suffocated There is no place in this world for girls like me and I just want out.",1
"I have been browsing through this subreddit for who knows how long, at least a few weeks, maybe a month.I do not think I have ever posted here though, until now.Anyway, so stuff has been really shitty at home. I have been living with narcissists all my life, and now that I am 18 things have gotten way worse.To spare you all my life story, my mom is an abusive POS and my grandma and to some extent, my grandpa are enablers of her and are on her side. My mom spread lies about me and used her persuasiveness to get an unknown number of people to believe that she never abused me. Or that what she did was not abuse.I have been job searching for 6 months at this point. I have been looking for remote work, due to my location and not wanting to be chained to this area if I want to move, and so I do not leave a paper trail of my earnings/etc in case my grandma opens my mail again. I have made about ~50 USD freelancing, but finding work is hard and sifting through the shitty posts or the ones that do not relate to my skills is taking a toll. I just want to leave. I am living with my grandparents and my mom recently moved back in. She is just as physically and emotionally abusive as she always was. I cannot stand her.My grandma apparently wants me to pay $400 a month in rent when I can find a job, but for some reason could not tell me that directly and passed the ""dirty work"" on to my mom. I wanted to move out before then, so I do not have to pay to stay here and be tethered to this place.But everything I do fails. I have submitted probably hundreds of resumes to remote jobs, only to never hear back 99% of the time, or get rejected. I am starting to wonder why I even try, when I cannot even take 99% of my belongings with me when I can move without my family trying to get into a legal battle over gifts which are my property and not my mother's. Why not just end it and stop my awful contributions to the world so no one has to deal with me again? it is not like I will ever get my dream career anyway. Or be who I want to be in life, instead of staying in the closet while I live with my parent like the rest of the relatives I live with do. Long time lurker.... first time posting here",1

I feel like there are infinite paths infront of me and each lead somewhere but I am to scared I will pick the wrong one like I did with hospo. I tell myself I am trying to take it slow and figure it out so I do not rush into anything bad, But doing nothing makes me feel so empty and voided.

Just hit three months sober and clean from self-harm, does not change a fucking thing.I just want to be numb, I want to go on a huge drug filled bender, go somewhere with loud, angry music and just get so fucking high I forget I even exist.

I am in 3 different therapies, in the Navy (with no support from them), and I am married. But it does not make anything better. The money nor the loving relationship. I love being married to her, but it does not elevate me any higher than the dumpster I feel like I am in. Id rather dream than wake up everyday to taking medication that does not even work, no matter how we switch it up. I try using the tools that they taught me in Therapy but to no avail.

They gave me temporary distractions to work toward, but ultimately I found myself down in the same well I would always been. Summer's halfway done and it is made these feelings even more intense. what is the point of living? I still cannot find an answer. Am I just not supposed to fling myself off a building just because it will make the people around me sad? Are we all pretending to be happy for the sake of others?

All of this to try to make me feel something. I used all the tools I could to set the tone for today. But I just feel empty. I want to feel how everyone else around me feels, but I cannot. The fact that I cannot even feel good on my own birthday makes me feel like a failure. Logically, I know I am not. Logically, I know shit happens. Logically, I know there will be better days. But I do not get to choose when my brain believes logic or not. So today, I am hurting really bad. All I can think about, is wishing that I did not have to be here or feel this anymore. I will not act on those feelings, but it does not change the fact that they are stuck swimming in my head and hurting the hell out of me right now. I just need to get these words out somewhere safe. Where I do not hurt my loved ones for being honest about my pain. If anyone has any other ways or tips to help this hurt less, I would appreciate it. I am not going to, but God does this hurt.",0
"I am 18. I really hate myself. My teeth is decaying and I cannot do anything. No matter how hard I try to clean myself, I still look ugly, especially because I cannot afford extra stuff for my body. It is really hard to fix my diet (sugary and oily) because we are barely making it -- it is unlikely to plan our diet based on the budget we have. I still depend on my parents and our income can only suffice expenses for food and very basic stuff.I failed two university admissions and it really makes me question myself. I used to be good in academics. I wish I joined sports event when I was young and I also wish that I should not have focused on academics when I was a kid because now, all my academic achievements are literally useless.I hate it that I really do not have any skill. do not get me wrong, I have been trying for too long, yet the best I have got is something mediocre, or even terrible. That makes it hard for me to look for a job, and even do freelancing. They say it gets better. But everyday, I am getting closer to ending it all.

"here is the thing with gaining confidence, you have surrounded yourself with people who judge, take advantage, do not actually care, think of you as a joke, and you put up with it because you do not believe deserve better. For a long time I was like that and finally in my marriage it got pushed too far. She took the kids back to our home town and left me in the city by myself for 6 weeks. I told her not to, we fought about it lots until I finally said do whatever tf you want. After she returned was the first thing I told her I wanted a divorce. ""I will change, I will be different..."" The usual except she did not change, and a month later things were back to the way they were before, being a 2nd rate citizen to her family, constantly worried about her being happy first, and always me second. Few months later I began asking for a divorce again, and again, and again until finally she threatened me with the kids ""you will never see them, I will make the divorce a shit show, I will move home with them"" basically using the thing I fear the most against me. After about a year of continuous deterioration, I started to become close friends with girl I knew, we had a connection but nothing inappropriate happened (yet). After about a year was the first time I tried to kill myself, because I could not handle not having my kids and I was trapped. We got in a fight brought on me borrowing my brothers truck to help another friend move out of an abusive relationship (long story, but tldr basically had his truck too long so he freaked, so I skipped meeting my wife for lunch, so she freaked because people only think about themselves). I was intercepted walking to the overpass and hospitalized for a week. Took her 24 hours to visit.) Which is when I found understanding, no judgement, and acceptance in this friend and a relationship started in secret. Few months pass, still asking for a divorce, she takes the kids again for 5 weeks and still nothing moving towards separating and I tell her about my affair. I am done. She explodes, how could you ""cheat"" on me, you will never see the kids, etc etc UNLESS you never see the mistress again (here is the asshole part is that she was an acquaintance of my wife, friends I am not sure, not like they were close) but nonetheless it happened. She said we would have an amicable divorce, 50/50 custody, no bs. I agreed, broke it off, put the mistress through hell, gave it up not have my kids subjected to this. And then nothing happened, 2 months of sending mediation services to her until she finally says she is not going to cooperate. I reached back out to my girlfriend to mend things after barely to not at all talking the last 2 months and things get on the mend.Forward to Christmas, I leave early for work in order to see her, my ex wife packs the kids in the car at 530 in the morning to find my truck there and tells my 7 year old everything. How much of a pos I am, how I cannot be trusted. Acts like she is finding out we are together for the first time and this part I will never get over, my sister and brother are at my house telling her to keep the kids away from me, get a lawyer, fk me up as much as possible (my ex-wife verified this in one of her fits) so she keeps the kids from me over Christmas, I came close enough to killing myself again that I spent all of Christmas in the hospital. Literally the worst experience of my life. That was 6 months ago, she is slandered me to everyone we know, have not talked to my family in months (nor do I want to) and I am completely alone. I have never felt loneliness like this. I have a knife now but do not have the balls to go through with it. I wish I had my guns. Probably could have been over long ago. I am trying to convince myself my kids will be fine, maybe that is the hesitation. there is really nothing else holding me back, the 2 youngest will not even remember me, should not make any difference to them. it is my oldest. I do not want to hurt him but he would me better off with someone who was not such a mess. AITA Just did not want to be with her",1

I cannot move out either, rent is extremely high due to covid and I have no other relatives who want to take me with them.Already made cuts in my arms (not the horizontal ones either) and I am hesitant as to whether or not I should overdose on cough medicine. Something is stopping me despite losing it.My boyfriend is trying to help me and I think I am mainly stopping thanks to him but I see my sanity slowly drifting away. I feel horrible right now",1

New chapter!,0
"I have tried before, failed. Spent a week or so in a mental hospital while on active duty, ostracized and shit on by my ex wife while I was in the hospital. My whole life I had to watch my own back, growing up extremely poor in ghettos and around abusive people hoping my father would swoop in and save me one day but that never happened. Sexually abused by someone I thought I could trust when I was in grade school, I still cannot remember all the details because my brain will not let me, at least that is what my therapist explained to me and idk if that is good or bad. Gave my life and all of my love to my ex wife, only to have constant infidelity while on deployment but I still loved her, she FaceTimed me on my last deployment.... of her viciously punching her womb while in the 2nd trimester with our child. I had to watch her kill our child while trying to beg her to stop, then offer sympathy to her when I found out the kid was officially lost, but I was still the bad person. I would let her beat on me because I thought it was the right thing to take it like a man. My career was flushed because I tried to give her everything, I was damn good at my job too. I forgot how to function and began drinking a lot. I have failed at everything I tried to do in my life, if not at first a bit later. I was in therapy while still in, but after I got out that all went down the drain. Its been almost 2 years since I separated and I look nothing like I used to, a pile of sweaty shit that did not do anything but drink and get high to numb myself. I have been sober for a couple weeks which I should be proud of but now I think about offing myself even more. 9mm to my temple, easy off switch. The only reason I saw fit to keep living was to take care of my grandmother, but she is ok now and does not need me anymore. My mother died last October on her birthday, she froze to death in her own apartment. I was ignoring her because I could not handle her mental issues, what kind of piece of shit does that. She needed me. I am a jobless pos that does not know how to function in society, and I do not think I could ever handle a relationship again. I do not know who to talk to that would believe all of this and not look at me like yeah, okay buddy. I am not even sure why I am writing this. I hate myself more for whining about my problems. I am so tired of pretending to happy.. my thoughts and talking about my issues makes me feel like a crazy person, reality at times seems permanently warped, sometimes I feel like I succeeded and I am just living in some sort of fucked up purgatory. I have never been good enough for anyone, just a waste of space. The stuff anyone likes about me is a lie because I am pretending to be happy. Just a washed up pos vet, I do not feel deserving of that title either. This post is all over the place and I have no idea what I am trying to say or why I am even doing it. What is the fucking point of living, I have nothing meaningful to offer to anyone. I wish someone would kill me so my family would not have to deal with the memory of me doing it to myself. I am tired of living with my memories, so much fucked up shit I can never escape. But I do have signs of liver failure so hopefully that pans out and ends up killing me soon. It seems like just a matter of time.",1

"I have been getting about 10 hours of sleep a week for the past 4 months due to horrible coughing fits. I finally got a second doctor's appointment tomorrow after the medicine from the first did absolutely nothing to help at all. My life has become a living hell and if they are unable to help me tomorrow morning I am going to end my life. I cannot take the sleep deprivation and constantly coughing until I gag or vomit. I will still kill myself eventually even if they are able to help me but if they are not, I am just calling it in now. It may be coming up soon",1
"Hello dear reader, Today I have been staring at the abyss and I feel so drawn to it, I feel it calling my name softly and gently, I feel like I should just give up. To many bad memories haunt my mind and cloud my thoughts, I still remember the first time I got hit. I do also remember being punched for being gay at the age of 13 by older men in their 18's, I also remember being raped by 2 cops when I was going home from my office when I was 21, I remember swallowing a lot of pills when I was 7 and tightening a rope around my neck when I was 9. I remember loosing an amazing friend one summer day because I did not feel like seeing him at all, because how could I explain that I was feeling vulnerable for the assaulted I have lived in the past, I remember how my father stop seeing me because I was not man enough and I did not know how to catch a ball with my hands, I remember walking home when I was 8 during a hurricane wanting to be blown away by the gusts of wind and I remember loosing the man I loved that die during a tragedy. A man that always told me how strong I was even though I do not have the physique he used to have, he was muscular, strong and kind as a gentle giant, still he always looked at me when we wake up as I was ""Hercules"" or some hero of the ancient times and he used to say: ""My love I wish someday I could be half as strong as you are"". &amp;#x200B;I want to jump into the abyss or more like just stop holding on to life, but I do not want to die. I want to live, I want to leave behind my bad memories and my demons and my errors. If you God can read this I still believe with all my heart in you, I also know that you can see me. And in fact you are right here next to me, trying to reach my broken mended heart. It is silly to think that falling into the abyss will solve anything, but I am loosing my strength I have zero today, my heart is aching and my soul feels heavy and numb. I will not quit on living because I do want to deserve a happy ending, I want to be a nice, gentle man. Not a perfect one, not even a happy one. Just one with a future for me to build, I do not dream about travels, love, hope, boyfriends, friends, videogames or anything at all.I just want a second chance please, I will make it count and I will be humble about it. And that is my letter to you dear reader as you I do try to fight my very own darkness to keep it at bay, so that monster will not swallow me and let me still in my bed while my family sleeps on the same house. I have feel so much guilt in my life for being here, for being alive, for being able to breath. While so many people has lost their life due to and illness or an accident or a murderer. So my brothers and sisters out there can any of you help me lit my light because the night is here and I feel my light dimming and dying out, so please anyone out there.Be kind to me and bestow a little of your light so I can traverse this night and not fall into the void.With tears in my eyes, your brother Alex. Today it is my turn",0
I am going through a breakup with the woman I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. 7 years down the drain. I know it is for the better because we are toxic it for each other but I am feeling suicidaleven more than I ever had. I was on the brink of suicide before I met her and she helped me thru it. I have had the worst childhood from being molested and shunned by classmates and family. I felt like she was my rock and anchor in this life but now I have nothing. I am tired of feeling depressed. I am tired of hating myself. I am just ready for eternal sleep. I am not looking for any responses. This is more or less me trying to get shit off of my chest before I end it. FUCK LIFE Helpless,1
I want to die been thinking about it a lot its nothing in my life going too bad at the moment but its just been a constant thought in my head. Id be playing videos games something I enjoy but the thought would come again and again idk,0
"I find it funny how everyone always tells me that if I need hello I should reach out for it, then the minute to reach out for help I am ignored and no one actually wants to help.

"there is a Chinese saying which translates to add oil. it is used as words of encouragement, and is often a response to negative feelings. For whatever reason I always liked it--the implication that the speaker sees you struggling and fighting, and is waiting for you to win. I read through these posts and I see so many people fighting and none of you realize how fucking brave you are to still be standing. How many demons you slay each day like it was nothing. I read these posts when I am feeling down and sometimes it feels like we are all pushing against the current together. Trying to become our better selves. From one broken person to another, I see you fighting, and I want to see you win.",0
I find depression music makes me feel good and cope.Anyone else. ? Depressing music is my coping strategie.,0
"I have probably been depressed for a long time, but it started to get bad over this past year. I would sometimes have really sad days where I felt completely alone, and I thought that after seeking some treatment I would feel better, but nothing has changed. I started on antidepressants about two months ago and I really really wanted them to work, but honestly I feel the same as I did before, and now I am sad that I have spent so long being sad. The only person I can actually talk to is my girlfriend, but I know that if I am always honest I will just wear her down. I have some work friends but I never really talk with them outside just because I feel like it would just be weird. Since I am a remote student I have basically either been at work or at home for the year mostly alone, and I think it is starting to get to me. What do you guys do when the horizon seems like it keeps getting further away? Nothing super bad happened, but I just feel sort of demoralized that I feel this way. Rough patch seems to keep growing.",0
"Well, I guess I am nearing the end now. Sometime within the next 3 years I hope, I will be dead. I have started cutting my friends off and mentally preparing for when it comes. After all, if I have nothing to fall back on, then I will just attempt again naturally and one of those will be my last.When I try thinking about actually killing myself, a million thoughts run my mind. What happens after? Where do we go? What will my family think? Especially the uncertainty after death, is keeping me alive. Maybe we reincarnate, and maybe I will end up luckier than this life. I am supposed to live until 80, yet how am I to survive that long if I cannot even think about living to see adulthood? 4 years until I turn 18, but everyday feels like an entire lifetime of pain, I am supposed to live 66 more years of this?None of it feels worth it, I have become so lethargic that getting out of bed to eat has become a hard task. Nothing feels necessary, at least for my life. Even if I had some kind of prophecy to fill, what do I receive, what is the point? Is it the journey, could it be salvation? Because if this is the path they gave me, it better be some heavenly reward.Sometimes I wish I could not have the power to reason, to think. But I think the life of an animal to be even more monotonous and bland than my own. So I am stuck between being able to reason and think about my thoughts, but having a vivid and unique life; and having an almost mindless and empty life. Though that does not mean an animal would care, they just do what they are meant to, survive. Sometimes that is what I wish I can do, like at a flick of a switch. Isolate and live as if I were only living to live and survive, not having to think. Unfortunately, that is not a life society sees to be useful or productive, so I hope to be reborn as an animal of the sea. While it does not matter what I think now, I would like to be born as a dolphin as opposed to a lion, the ocean is vastly mysterious and unexplored; land is mostly explored and uninteresting(to me).My death will probably be a while away, but it brings me peace to plan and prepare for when the day comes. For now, I guess I am sticking around. That is all, Thank you. Isolation, planning, and life after death.",1
"I think I am sad. I do not want to die, but its terrible being alive. I am so sick of it, but most of all, I am truly alone. Other people have people, and that is what life is all about right? So there is no life without the people. I am crying and I do not know why",0
"I had plans. I wanted to go to college. I believed that if I would study hard, would get good grades, then I would go to a good school. I do not know why but I always believed that being a good student would be enough. That it would get me a scholarship. 'do not worry about money, just study hard' said my parents. They were wrong. All my classmates and friends went to college last year. I did not. I am a weak person. I looked for a job for a year and now that I got it I want to quit after just a week of working. Standing for 8 hours straight is really hard. I do not know if it is because I am fat or because I am used to studying and reading and not using my body. Maybe just because I am lazy. I work in a fabric and every time I walk past machines I got these thoughts about just ending my life, about jumping into them. No matter how much I try to stop, my head is imagining ways my body would get destroyed by these machines. It scares me. I am afraid that one day I will actually do it and someone will get hurt. For a year or two, I have been thinking about killing myself but I always have found a reason to stay alive. I even started writing stories again. It helped for a while. Not for long. I have talked to my mother and my friends about it, I have talked to a fucking psychologist. But I still feel so lonely. At one moment I want to get help and find a way to earn some money and live the life I want to. But then I realise that it is not going to work out and I want to just end it all. I am sad and angry and hurt but I do not know why. I am trying to find a reason to keep on living. But I do not know for how long I can do it. I have no idea why I am writing it. Maybe because I just want to tell someone about how I feel. I do not care. Title",1
"that is the worst. I tried to tell them about my huge mental struggle. At first, they were a bit supportive, but after a while they told me to stop complaining and get my shit together. I remember the day when I tried to tell my mum how deeply unsatisfied I am and she stopped me with ,,Enough complaining! Just do sthg about it.'' Well, after that, their impression is that things got better. I moved back to the dorm, so they do not see me often. They sincerely think I solved my problems. However, the reality could't be more different. I am totally losing it and planning my suicide. In one moment I am researching for suicide methods and in the other my mom calls and I respond with the lies I have prepared - how university is better, how my job is better, how I feel okay. And this is the worst feeling. Lying to my parents all the time. On the other hand, I cannot tell them the truth - they are fed up with it and have no means to help me. They would't understand. The worst feeling is lying to my parents that everything is OK",1

"I have been battling constant suicidal thoughts in the last month, hopelessness, I even started seld harming. Suddenly, my mother who previously had a downplaying attitude to it, changed and now she started listening to me and caring about me. I finally vented out all my anger and suffering.Now I am not really feeling better, rather feeling numb and isolated. Maybe Its a bit better, since I do not think about suicide that much, or self harm, but I am basically just on autopilot. I sit down in front of the computer once I gathered the energy to get out of bed, and keep playing, or watch youtube, all day long. I do not even have time to think about anything, I honestly do not know how I am feeling.Is this a normal part of depression? Maybe I was stupid and faking depression somehow, id this should not be like this? I am so fucking confused about my feeling and thoughts, I just want to flow away Does this mean something?

"My thoughts amount to nothing ore than an attempt to intellectualize my own depression and suicidal tendencies, and if I had anything of real value to say it would be in a university and note a suicide note on Reddit.com so you should not take anything said here seriously. Id like to return to a time before I could process stimuli, a time long before I could recognize that I could process stimuli. Suffering is a quintessential characteristic of life. Endless strains of boredom are riddled with doubt, insecurity, and disappointment, and this is tolerated all in the pursuit of rare instances of euphoria. Id rather cease to react to anything at all, to forfeit my awareness of my thoughts, feelings, ambitions, physical pain. Id rather not have been born at all. Id like lose consciousness",1
"TW- Sexual AssualtI SAd my friend and I feel absolutely disgusting, I am not asking for absolution nor does my POV and context of the situation excuse what I did. I am asking what I should do as I cannot live with the fact I did this especially as I was already suicidal.I went out with friends and invited a friend I met on a dating app that I had known previously and was in town visiting, we got drunk and since she drove I told her she could stay at my place, prior to this night I had recently reconnected with friends after disappearing for months during a mental health episode and things looked up for once.This Is where I completely fuck up and I cannot believe I did this. After drinking with some friends at my place we cuddle and put on a movie, we were all over each the entire night prior to being drunk too, she specifically told me she did not want to have sex because she was going through a lot and recently attempted, I genuinely wanted to respect that and not make her uncomfortable so at this time I accepted nothing would happen although I did hope in the back of my head something would. We were cuddling and she told me she would take off her shirt because it was hot, I told her I understand and that I did not want to make her do anything she did not want to (although in the end I did). She then said that that makes her want to do it more (have sex) and I insisted I did not want to make her do anything she is uncomfortable with I should have stopped everything here in retrospect but given I was also intoxicated but its not an excuse. She layed on me and I played with her chest we then told each other some pretty vulnerable stuff like how I am a virgin.She said things like I cannot believe someone as handsome and amazing as you has not been with anyone etc. I told her I have a lot of trauma that made me shy around girls. I am not entirely sure what happened next but we made out a little and she ended up laying over my legs on her stomach I assumed she wanted to watch the movie. I began touching her more aggressively and took off her underwear the entire time I did not realize she was passed out asleep I thought she may have closed her eyes because as I touched her more intimately (but never putting anything inside her) she started to breath heavier. In hindsight should have not took this as consent. I stopped to get up, and saw her eyes were closed so I put a blanket over her it still did not click what I had done.She then asked a couple seconds after tucking her in why she had no underwear. I immediately realized what I had done was not consensual I started to apologize the best I could while intoxicated. But she was still half asleep. After apologizing profusely and waking her up she became very empathetic telling me that it was okay and she will not tell anyone and that I did not know she was asleep. I tried to tell her that it does not matter what I did was fucked up but somehow ended up with her embracing me and encouraging me to talk about the trauma I mentioned to her earlier so I did it was weirdly therapeutic and I was so confused because I just did something horrible to her.She ended up sobering up and to my protest she drove and I bought her food and told her how sorry I was agin and if there was anything I can do let me know before she dropped me back at my place. I stupidly texted her after not sleeping at all that She should let me take her on a proper date because she said she wanted to see each other before she left town I know I am a stupid idiot but I texted her that, she obviously declined and I knew she felt differently than when it initially what happened as she was probably sobering up and processing what happened.I told her I understand and that it was selfish of me to ask. She then sent me a longer text later in the day and it was that she felt violated and that I took advantage of her which I absolutely did. Despite that She told me that she genuinely thinks I am a good friend and hopes I thrive one day and get help but that she has to block me for her own mental health. I replied with a really long apology that I hope was sincere and understanding but it did not go through as I was expecting.I am not sure what to do now I have been a mess the entire day, I feel so fucking horrible for what I did its eating me alive. I was already pretty suicidal and had a really bad view on myself but I am not sure how I can move forward from this as I feel I do not deserve to. I did something I cannot forgive myself for and Ibe already been Suicidal for a while. NSFW",1

"I have not been in a worse state ever I am in high school the best time of your life but I have just been miserable Time has been going by so fast I have no interest in what comes next like at allIf I could just sleep for the rest of my life that would be ideal in all honesty I just want to be ten feet underground The problem with killing yourself is that you could survive. Imagine having to life the rest of your life in a state even worse then now. Say you survive, would you know better to finish the job, or would you just suffer?Everything has gone downhill since that year. I had a large group of friends that year who all cared for one another. We looked after each other. We had similar interested. It was fantastic! I had a phenomenal teacher that year. Our class was so close. You could chat with anybody. It felt like a miniature family. My family did not fight every day back then. There was an influx of video games to play. Content I enjoyed (both television and YouTube) was at a peak. I actually enjoyed playing Basketball.I had motivation to get out of bed. Lastly, have not been in a relationship since 2017/2018. Have no interest in it. The worst part about all of this is that I did not cherish it as much in the moment compared to now. How was I supposed to know it just got worse? Everything has gone downhill since 2017",1

"So I am 24 in a pretty shitty spot: just failed university after already having retakes, poor, barely any family, stupid, cowardly , no relationship or sexual history- and due to a selection of physical bad hands, anxiety and bad social skills that does not look to change any time soon- and simply zero work rate, years of procrastination and depressive symptoms so future career prospects are in the gutter as well. I have always been confident I would never kill myself because of how it would affect my family members, but as the perspective of my situation has gotten more clear due to the stress of university I have borderline fantasized over it, I have known for years now on what I need to do to improve my situation but never had the discipline to stick with my attempts. honestly I know realistically I will never amount to anything or start a family and feel worse as time goes on, being a fuck up at 18 is fine you can fix it and have a good youth and future, fuck up at 30 I presume is soul destroying let alone being alone at 50.

"M 17. I hate myself. The first thought that comes to my mind when I wake up in the morning is ""I want to die"" or something similar. School is going back this month here and I am already expecting my suicidal thoughts to be stronger than they already are, as they always have been. I usually do not get bullied but I always get ignored. If I stopped going for weeks, no one would notice or care. I have never had close friends, except for one - and this one betrayed and left me a few years ago. I just wish I could be happy or be dead. I would much rather be happy, but that seems to be a reality far away from me. I do not expect help from strangers on the internet (I do not mean to be rude), I just wanted a place to express myself. I am really just waiting for me to turn 18 so I can dig myself into alcohol to try to be a little happy, at least for a short time. Suicidal thoughts, loser life",1
"I am definitely depressed as fuck and I am to pussy to waste my parents time telling them. Its getting worse everyday, I slept for 12 hours today and had 7 hours of screen time. None of my friends invite me anywhere and seeing them on Snapchat makes me even more depressed. Even when I do go out I am not myself which is prob why they do not want to hangout anymore. I thought summer would be great but it fucking sucks and school sucked just as much this year. I want to tell my parents, but I am such a pussy I know I will not. I know everyone is going to say tell your parents, but I literally cannot and I do not want to tell anyone else. I barely have energy to get up and eat food anymore the only thing that makes me go somewhere is my part time job which sucks ass. FML. I wish I could just have fun fuck my life. I want to drink alcohol, but I know that will only make it worse so I just sit in my room playing video games, which I do not even like to do. I am a bitch",0
"Long rant warning.I feel depresssed. After a 3 year break from school, i decided i want to make a change for my life, to pursue a career as a nurse as i have always wanted to be on a medical team. I fall behind on my studies so i ought to look for tuitions. So now i have a new tuition teacher, he is efficient, had cultivated lots and lots of A score students.I am always making mistakes, its hard for me to understand what they are saying and the teacher encouraged (to me it is *preasuring*) us to interact with him otherwise we will not be allowed in class ( online classes). I do not know how to answer, my national language is not as good as the others, so i might be blurting out gibberish.He is straight foward and always say that i am wrong. It is a normal and rightful thing to say, and i do have to know if i am doing it right or wrong, it is his job, but my depresssed mind kept interpreting it as disgust because i am older than other students yet am still far behind. When he speaks, to me it is very hurtful even though it is beneficial or normal reaction or rightfully or some positive shyt. I felt that my depression, sadness and broken heart are irrational and unjustified. It is really hindering me from my studies and possibly future job, i have anxiety and just the thought of every thing concerning my studies or my teacher are making me soo sad and heart broken.What do i do? Should i go see a doctor? But my hospital is in lockdown because of the covid outbreak inside it. Should i take a break from my tuition? I do not want to be seen as a coward and run away from my problems, i also want to be one of his successful students. If i were to persue in nursing, there will be much more harder trials than my teacher correcting me. I am falling apart, me falling behind on studies is really making me depressed and despair. I think i could mention to my tuition teacher about my mental illness and take a break again from the tuition until maybe the doctor sorts me out. What do you think? Sorry for the rant. Grateful but feeling sad because of my teacher, any advice would help.",0

"I have been some form of depressed with anxiety for 25 years. Some times are better than others but its always been there. I have managed all this time by distracting myself. Finding something to look forward to. Obviously last year was a struggle. 2021 brought very little optimism with it. The Jan 6th insurrection, in my mind, is only a minor precursor of what is to come. Something that I have seen coming for what feels like my entire life- climate change, political and social instability. Against my better judgement, I have a child now, who is the most important person in my life. But I cannot shield her from this. she is too young to be vaccinated against COVID but were expected to carry on as if everything is fine now. I love my husband dearly but he needs my attention all the time. Hes manipulative but I do not think he realizes it. I work from home but my boss is going to make me return to the office at the end of Summer and I do not want to. My mom is dying from cancer. My closest work friends wife is dying from cancer. My sister died of cancer seven years ago. My dog is getting to the end of his life. I have no friends and terrible insurance. I am struggling to find the reason I keep pushing on. I find no enjoyment in anything. Work is beyond stressful and my job is pointless. The stress and anxiety it causes is affecting everything in my life and my health. My husband does not make enough money to support us and I cannot take a pay cut. I just feel like the check he would get from my life insurance, after I end things will solve all of these problems. Struggling to find the reason to not pursue this path. 25 year battle is rearing its ugly head",0
"Hello r/depression, 21M here, I have been meaning to create this post for a few days but have spent sometime collecting my thoughts before I proceed, my primary objective with this post is to see if anyone can relate and whether what I am feeling is 'normal' or something more.For some background, I was a relatively happy child with my most fond memories being around ages 10. For some reason around this age is permanently burnt into my mind, so vivid where as everything else is quite vague. If I really think back this is most likely the last time I felt true happiness in my eyes, just after my father &amp; mother divorced so my mother, brother and I living together. Not that I personally feel like this had any major impact on me, just something to mention also.Up until 2017 which was my last year of high school things were okay, nothing that would really stand out. Just going through the motions like most teenagers I suppose, by no means was I a social butterfly or anything but I had a few friends with whom I would play WoW with after school / on weekends.February 2018 is when I can pinpoint the first time I felt the feeling of malaise. I remember it distinctly, sitting on the couch thinking ""wow this is really strange, maybe I am just tired. should just get an early night"". My family had gone on holidays and I was home alone so I narrowed it down to just being a bit lonely.\## There was some more background I was going to add, but I do not want to bore anyone and understand this is not a therapy session. ##Fast forward to 2019 / 2020, I started feeling this malaise more often maybe once or twice a month for a week or so. It sounds bizarre but I could feel it coming, my eyes start feeling heavy and I can feel pressure on my forehead. I would not say I feel sad at all, I just feel nothing or emptiness. My father passed away in 2019 and I felt nothing, so much so I felt obliged to put on an act so other people would not think I was a psychopath.Still at the time, it was not too hard to deal with as it would go after a week or so, October last year they seemed to become more intense and longer lasting. To where I took up smoking pot again to help, I work and have a lot of study outside of work so I stopped as I knew deep down what I should really be doing.As I see it now everything is so pointless, I do not enjoy anything anymore the only thing I really have to live for is my family and even then I do not really communicate. I just spend all my time inside my own head, an eternally one sided dialog to try and help with loneliness &amp; emptiness.Even when I feel something, anything it puts me into a bad mood. Last time I can recount is walking past a KFC and the smell provoked some sort of feeling and then again I feel like shit. I do not even bother hanging onto anything for hope anymore, while studying I took a long break from gaming. What got me through was the thought of playing again, once I got there no enjoyment.I think sometimes life just is not for me, not everyone can enjoy or find value in everything.Is this me being overly sensitive, I understand there are people who have it worse than me but I just cannot shake this feeling of emptiness, loneliness, indifference, hopelessness.. I do not even know how to describe it, I am supposed to live for another 50 years, I just cannot see it happening. Is what I am feeling 'normal'? How do I proceed from here?",0

"Seriously, Idk if ppl are dumb or if they are too listless to understand others problems. So let us go: being an adult does not solve anyones problems. Do you all really think that being 18+ solves ppls problems ? Plot twist: IT does not! If the person was a difficult kid, a difficult teen, what makes you think that adulthood would bring solutions ? that is pathetic. Ppl like me that grew up in poverty for years are supposed to magically have a nice life after being 18 ? Ppl are too fucking naive. I hate my life and I will always do unless it becomes better. Adulthood does not solve anyones problems. Stop with this shit.",1
"I am a loser and a failure who was handed countless chances in life and I blew all of them. I am 26 going on 27 and it feels like I already have one foot out of the door. Even typing this seems pointless because it is clear I am going to be dealing with depression and wanting to kill myself for the rest of my life. I used to care so much and want to become something, whatever that is, but there is just too much goddamn pain. Now it just hurts to think about he life I idealized for myself, and instead will spend it wasting away until I succumb to some sort of illness. Either that or I will kill myself. I am a mess up and a failure and there is no way to redeem myself. I am just so tired and want to go to sleep forever, do not want to think about the dim reality of my future and how I fucked everything up. Wish it was not so hard to leave though. No ones words can help. I feel myself slipping deeper and deeper into a void that no one can help me escape from.",1
"Does anyone else feel like they are constantly waiting for that one thing to give them an ounce of joy? ie that one clothes delivery, that one new episode, that one takeaway that will provide some kind of happiness for a couple of minutes. Then it fades and you are waiting for the next thing to make you feel something. Is this it? Do I need to rely on superficial things to make me feel remotely happy? When I cannot find something to make me feel that way, I feel like I am literally just waiting to die. I cannot believe I need to spend the rest of my life waking up, working, thinking of what to have for dinner, and trying to find little things to bring me some short-lived joy. How mundane. What a sad little life (Jane. Enjoy the money I hope it makes you very happy etc) Waiting",0
I feel unstable and unable to be on my own at the momentThis week has been bad for me. I am suffering from a lot of trauma and for some reason its all surfacing this week. I scratched my roommate severely during a panic attack in which he was helping me. Its a huge scratch and is going to scar. He called 911 because of me. Last night I had suicidal thoughts and could not be separated from him. I have slept in the same bed as him for the past week. I cannot be away or else my mind wanders and last night I was feeling suicidal. I am so terrified my girlfriend is going to leave me for literally no reason. Were happy and love each other. My therapist cancelled our session today because she is sick and I feel like that is the only thing that could have calmed me down. I do not know what to do I feel unstable and unable to be on my own at the moment,1
"My medication got doubled a few weeks ago and it really helped lift my mood, but now today I seem to have hit bottom again. The urge to self harm and wishing to be dead have come back strong as ever. Plus I keep thinking about my ex I split up with years ago and I miss his company, not him but the closeness we had, he was the only person to ever know the full me &amp; there is been no one since. Not sure what is suddenly driven it back this bad but I feel like writing it hear might help a bit as I do not have anyone I can talk to. Sure I have friends but I do not want to be a burden on them as most of them have their own problems or the other ones do not understand/ understanding enough. I guess I am more venting than anything but I am so frustrated that after doing better for a while I have plummeted and there is no reason for it. Anyone else ever get that? Feel so depressed today after weeks of feeling better.",0
"Pog, if you are reading this, I am probably dead. About 9 months before my oldest brother was born, I did the maths on my parents ages and it worked out that my mother was barely 16 at the time, whereas my dad was almost 34. Which is pretty fuckin creepy. This also predates the solemnization date of their marriage by about 6 months. As a kid, I was basically treated like the favourite child, fuckin royalty by my mother. Which is not a good thing, honestly. She pretty much treated me like a toddler until I was about 13, shielding me from everything, i.e. sex, kids that were not my colour, etc. She also did some really creepy and gross shit, like forcing me to wear nappies, showering with me, to a very creepily late age. Its probably why I act so immature and childish, I literally do not know how to grow up. I am always going to be an annoying fuck :DDD She also started going on real weird power trips, like screaming about how I should know my place over the smallest things, and buying sticks to beat us with :)))Anyway, cos I was treated like a favourite child, it caused my four siblings to fucking r e s e n t me. I remember one time, when I was 8 and he was 17, my brother kicked me fuckin hard. He had to move out for a few months. I was told the reason why is cos the police were investigating that thing, turns out my sisters made false rape allegations against him. My other brother also told me the entire family breaking down was my fault (This was when I was 7 or 8, its probably why I apologise for fuckin everything. I do be ruining everything )Every day, my dad used to come around. My parents got divorced cos my mum wanted to get a job and not be a stay-at-home mum, and my dad got pissed the fuck off. He lived in the second house we had, my mother kicked him out and got the first house in the divorce proceedings. They fought every fucking day, a couple times it got physical but most of the time it was just yelling. During one of their shouting matches, I remember my dad shouting something that he only came every day for me, because my other siblings are old enough to go see him whenever they wanted. I felt hugely fuckin guilty cos it was literally my fault that everyone had to deal with these fights cos of me, so I eventually moved out in 2017 because I hated the feelings of guilt whenever he came around. That shit backfired anyway, because I was seen as the fucking enemy by my mum, as if I betrayed her side of the family when I just wanted the fighting and shouting to stop.Right after i left my mum, my uncle (head of Maths at the school I went to) got me a school therapist who was actually just his mate telling me by Islamic law I should respect my mum and go back to her because otherwise I will go to hell. I reported him and he got fired, but it left a sour taste in my mouth, I fucking hate therapy now. shit I do not remember the dates for.Finding a picture of a young girl (like, a toddler.) in a swimsuit hidden on the family computerMy brother putting my mother in a headlock, and almost fuckin choking her out.I also have a feeling I was nonced on as a kid, because I seem to have the symptoms other victims have, ie. repressing most of my childhood memories, hypersexuality from a VERY young age, and a fear of males in general, to be honest.I just feel like an accident. it is less that I want to die, I just wish I was not here in the first place. Taking up space, annoying people, making tons of mistakes, hurting people I care about. At this point I self-harm because I deserve the pain. Even as I type this, I am marking up my skin, scratching my wrists and my torso. It stings, but I cannot stop doing it.I try my best to be a good person. I give food to as many homeless people I can see, I try to be supportive and caring, the kind of friend I always wish I had when I was suffering. But I cannot help feeling like its not enough. I am not enough for anyone. All I ever wanted was to make people smile, to help them as much as I can so my existence is not a complete fucking waste.But I keep fucking up, I keep hurting people, I keep on being a cunt. I do not know how to fix myself, and I am starting to realise I cannot.I just want to know why I hate myself so damn much.I am sick of being an outcast, all I have ever wanted is to fit in, to be normal. But every time I look in the mirror, no matter what I do, all I can see are my parents, and what they fucking made me. I need to force myself to remember Ill always be alone, instead of getting my dumb fucking hopes up whenever I meet a new person. Because they will abandon me sooner or later.

"Hi all,I have had depression since I was a kid. I have a long family history of bipolar, borderline. It was talked about and my parents have mental health issues, but the only thing I was ever treated for is ADHD.In the past, I used to have pretty bad GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and had a lot of panic attacks. I would also have some really severe points of depression where I was pretty debilitated for 1-2 weeks, but I have found for the most part my more severe points of anxiety/depression have diminished.I do have some substance issues, mainly drinking which is not a daily thing but once i start i cannot stop, just heavy binge drinking. I did used to use quite a bit of c\*ke which was a big personal and financial issue, but I have curbed that for the most part. A few of my friends actually had an intervention with me about my drinking, when I get past the point of no return with alcohol I get extremely depressive and just talk about dark stuff in my past and just want to take any and all drugs. My friends were basically like every time you drink you do this and its too much for us etc, we cannot deal w this and you need to stop. so severer depression recently has manifested itself more in substances than in my day to day.however, my day to day is meaningless and empty. I do well at work because its the one thing I am a perfectionist about, but the way I live is so depressing. I have nothing to look forward to, I wake up, go to work, go home, watch tv, sleep. Sometimes have friends over for drinks.I cannot take care of myself, I can barely maintain personal hygiene like showering or doing laundry, i have garbage all over my apartment. I have no energy or motivation to do anything. Something traumatic happened to me about 5 years ago, since then I have gained 100 pounds just with binge eating.I cannot even look at myself in the mirror, let people take photos of me. Before I had insecurities, but I still wanted to be seen. My friends do not even invite me out for day activities because on my days off I am in bed till like 5pm.I am an artist, that is the only thing i care about. i have not been able to make work in almost 2 years because the burden of it feels like too much. I feel like a fraud, like i do not even know where to start.I am not majorly depressed right now, I have been there where all I want is to die, but its more just like day in and day out meaninglessness. I dissociate a lot, always going through the motions and i feel like I am wasting my life.I am really uncomfortable with doctors, i have not been to one since 2012 lol because of a bad experience. Overall though I can barely take care of myself so scheduling appointments is something I have been delaying for years.but for those in a similar situationon antidepressants, ssris etc -has this helped you deal with the day to day? I know i should make a lifestyle change and put more effort into being happier, but it just feels so daunting. I am wondering if beginning with a prescription will get me to the point where i can begin to address the areas of my life i need to work on. pls share your medication experience/how it impacted you! i feel like its the only way for me to get somewhere because i feel like I have been completely stagnant. will antidepressants help me, or do i need to make a lifestyle change?",0
"I thought depression was something that could go away again, but now I am starting to realize that it probably never gets better actually - the best you can hope for is a zombie-state-life on medication where you cannot feel any euphoria from movies, music etc. When you get older you just lose your ability to feel profound emotions from stuff? I am only 22, but i feel like i have already experienced this decline since i was 14-15 when i started to feel really depressed. it is been 7-8 years now, and the only thing that made life worth living for me was smoking weed and being high 24/7, which you can only do for so long. Now I am back to being sober because weed was driving me completely insane and was having panic attacks everyday, and i feel completely depressed every single day wanting to kill myself. I cannot even get on medications because i accidentally told my doctor about my former weed habit, so they want me to be 6 months sober before prescribing any medication. I just wanted to ask in here, does it get better? is it a real thing, or is it just a myth.Otherwise I am ready to kill myself honestly, because I am not going to fight a losing battle any longer. Does it ever get better?",0
"I have always had the thought of killing myself. Ever since I would have to say 5th grade. But as they say, when those thoughts coming into your mind at such a young age they are not serious. I think this is what started my suicidal thoughts though. Having them brought into my mind at such a young age and then not being properly analyzed. It was more of a brush it off thing. So now I sit here at just 25 years of old recently.. things may have gotten better slightly before high school ended. Then as soon as it was over.. the downhill spiral seemed to accelerate x15. Right now I would not mind me passing at literally any given moment. From where I sit I do not see any possible way to create an incline for myself. A little more background is I used to be a drug addict. I worked the clinic program instead of the 12 steps because personally I find some of the steps total horseshit (not all). But with that being said as of the past month Id say I was at the last third of my treatment. And I got to do what I always do Fuck it up. I used and I hate myself so much more now. There was no point in going on the stupid 2 week bender that I did but now that I did it. I have backtracked myself 8 months. Do you know how devastating that is. To me Its almost enough to just say fuck it because to have that possibly happen again I would be wasting my own lifealong with the others who genuinely tried to help me along the way. So I guess the shortest aspect of this post is thatIm lost and I am ready to give up Soon?",1
"I am still here bc some people want me to be here. But they will not do shit to help. Just expect me to be alive and suddenly be well.

Bc nobody wants to fucking deal with me, they just want me to be around bc I do not fucking know why. Bc its morally wrong to not care? Idfk I have been attending therapy for half a year and nothing fucking changed. Its even worse. Everyday is an emotional roller coaster of negative emotions and just cannot take it anymore.

"I am a 26 year old who lives somewhere in Latin America. I am quite well economically, I have a job in technology not affected by the pandemic, I am physically healthy.Many people I have met across all ages told me I am very intelligent. I can learn anything I put my will to, and I am typically complimented at work. I can speak various languages as well, and had some breakthrough achievements at work. I was lucky enough to have a good family that supported whatever choices I made, and I could travel and live in Europe for a little more than two years. Some people think I am good looking and interesting, I was able to have a healthy sex life in my youth with people all over the world.Many people would kill to have at least one or two of the things I have described above...Funnily enough, as cheesy as it sounds, I feel like killing someone too, myself. Or rather, I would like to stop existing...do not worry if you think this is a suicide note, I am not going to do anything yet.I have made a pathetic attempt before on my life some years ago. I was not in any life threatening situation, but I called an ambulance and told them I had tried to commit suicide. Trying to commit suicide is a crime in my country. As my perfect luck would have it, the police chief assigned to me that night saw me as a very desperate and lonely person, and wrote off my attempt as a cry for help. My parents came to the hospital, the police chief evaded his responsibilities, and I was able to get out a few days later. I went home as if nothing ever happened, I still have large scars on one of my wrists, meaning that this event will chase me forever.Some days I forget that scar is there. Some days I look at it but do not even pay any attention to it. I do not cover it with long sleeves, but I always have that scar facing my body, so other people will not see it.But it will always follow me through the rest of my days.A couple of years ago I returned to my country. I had been in Europe studying at an University as part of some program. Ever since that day, I have done nothing but work. I am thankful for the work I have, and I am climbing the ladder very quickly and I will be able to easily find a job anywhere in the world.However, I have no friends. No one I can a friend. All my relations now are just acquaintances from work. I have a very hard time being sociable. My depression has made me completely boring and unable to relate to anyone, or have a normal conversation. I have misophonia, so the sounds that people make give me a strong painful reaction. Think like every human sound is the sound of nails on a chalkboard.I do not have any hobbies. If I do feel like doing something, it most likely is something I can enjoy by myself. I try to avoid social interactions as much as possible.Due to the pandemic, I was able to move back with my parents and work from home. I live in another town a few kilometers away from work and I can save more money for investments, but I have no social life at all. The relation with my family is null. Just the bare minimum and the essentials. No love or emotions allowed.Just as I move everything from my house and finally move in with my parents, my coworkers decide to start hanging out regularly. They meet at bars and have a drink or two. I should not really care about this, but it has really affected me.Is it a hard coincidence from life? One of those motherfucking facts of life? Or were they always waiting for me to move away?In any case, my emotions right now would not have been different. I feel betrayed, even if I should not feel like so.The coworkers are young like myself, and while I am above them in the ladder, I always saw them as my equals. I spent many hours helping them, educating them on work topics they did not feel comfortable enough.One of them is a girl I have some feelings for, but she does not have the same back. However, she wants to stay friends. She noticed that I am not feeling well, since we do not talk as much through text chats on the phone.I may have ruined the ""perfect image"" I am always showing to the rest of the world, and to her as well. If there ever was a chance that me and her would hook up or something, I do not think that is possible anymore.One side of me wants to give them another chance, maybe if I ask, we can all meet and drink, and share nice stories! Maybe I can rebuild the chat I had with this girl, and who knows what could happen.The other side of me wants to destroy this relation, never come back to the office, never chat with them again, break my promises with this girl, and escape as soon as possible.If you think this sounds very childish, it is because I never developed how to control my emotions. I am very sensitive to things that people say or think about me. My emotions are stuck in pre-teen mode.I do not know what is this feeling I have right now. They are all negative. I feel betrayed, angry, in despair, saddened. For the first time in a long time, I have been just lying in bed doing nothing.From this little slip in my emotions, I can turn self destructive, and the short or long relations I have had, destroy them. Which in turn, gradually transforms the slip into a downfall. But hey, it is not all that bad. In a few months, once the pandemic calms down and I am fully vaccinated, I will be able to go to Europe.I have told my bosses about my idea, and they are in support, and even offered me the chance to work remotely from there. Get some money on the side while I find a more suitable work option. it is all going to be all right, correct? Except, the same things that happen to me here in my country, have happened in the previous times in Europe, and will absolutely happen again. The exact same things I wrote above, happened in my country all through my childhood and further. It happened on my first trip to Europe. It happened when I returned. It happened when I went back to Europe, and now, it happened again.When do this shit change? Hahaha Just got to survive for a couple more months, and everything will be all right.... correct? When do this shit change?",0
This is the last year of my life. I can feel like everythings about to come to a close. Darkness is closing in and the curtains about to fall. I can tell its almost over,1
"I am so miserable with my life. I feel so alone and depressed. I feel disconnected from my family, I feel like no one cares, I am sick of it. I am sick of having mental illnesses that make me scared to be alone and clingy and codependent I am sick of having to go through various coping exercises to deal with small issues. I am so sick of it. I want to have a normal brain and normal reasoning naturally, I do not want everything to be a wheel of mental torture anymore. I want to be normal so badly but its so hard. I feel so lonely and do not look forward to anything anymore. I just want this to be over, I have never felt so low before. I used to be able to find good somewhere but I literally cannot anymore. I just wish it would stop I am not sure how to do this anymore",0
it hurts too much to go alone may someone please keep me company before i go,1
"I am 23 and I have been battling with depression since 2008/9 but was not officially diagnosed until 2018 when I decided to finally get help. For the longest time I was terrified because of the stigma behind mental illness. I did not want to be seen as less than just because of my depression. There is so much that has contributed to my depression that I do not know what it is anymore. Between being bullied in school and at home, to growing up in a violent household, to being sexually assaulted at 17, to the loads of bullshit my father put me through then leaving and not having anything to do with me, and so much more, its all been bottled up so much. All I want to do is isolate away from family and friends. I do not want anything to do with anyone anymore and its hard for me to hold a conversation. I am surprised I have been making straight As in college (I am working on my second college degree) and a 4.0 GPA with all of this going on but to me that does not help or validate me in any way. I feel so lost and I feel like suicide is my only way out, but I cannot do that. I have a 2 year old daughter who needs me to stick around and the ONLY reason I have not attempted to take my life in the last two years (I have had failed attempts), is because of her and only her. I just do not know what to do anymore.. I am losing..",0
"I do not have energy for anything I enjoy. The thought of doing something I enjoy gives me so much anxiety and guilt. Time flies by so fast I feel like as soon as I wake up the day is over an hour later. I wonder where my whole day went. I feel so worthless and overwhelmed. I am functioning only enough to keep my kids and myself alive. I want to feel alive so much. I do not feel anything at all, sometimes Ill feel overwhelming sadness, that is it. I feel love when I talk to my kids, but one has autism and one has adhd I often wonder if they really do love me or if they love me only because I am all they have. Any advise on how to be alive and feel alive would be appreciated. Thank you Feeling very alone in this world.",0
"Hey guys I really do not know how Reddit works so I am giving this a try. Never thought my first post would be on something like this. Not sure if it falls under depression but its been hard to keep going. I am not thinking of suicide or anything crazy but I have recently fallen into the mentality of what is the point? I am 21 years old I have plenty of friends even a girlfriend. I used to love going to the gym every day and now it feels like a chore. Everything I do feels like a chore. Recently I have been thinking that I am just doing all of this to get a good paying job work a 9-5 and call it a day. At the end of the day I am just going to die eventually, could be tomorrow or 60 years from now. I cannot really talk to my parents about it because they tell me you have friends a girlfriend and a job you have nothing to be sad about When people ask me what is wrong, I do not really know what to say because nothing in my life is worth being sad over. From an outside point of view my life is great, but its easier to tell people I am fine than explain things. I do not really know what I expect to come of this post but typing it out has helped me out a bit. Thanks for reading. New User",0
"Okay so something suddenly, seriously suddenly, happened to me 2 nights ago. I was minding my own business, and was lying down, about to go to sleep, when a sudden felling and sensation of foreboding, as if I am going mad, sadness, came over me. It was so uncomfortable that I woke my paremts up, fearing that i would loose my mind and hurt them or myself.My parents are very supportive, and loving and i am the apple of their eyes. The feeling of foreboding did not go, and i continued to feel that sensation. My mom kept an arm around me, and I tried to sleep. I did sleep eventually, tho it was not great, but still, it was sleep.The next day i hoped i will feel okay, but then it did not go. Thoughts of wanting to harm myself came, when i literally do not have anything bad happening in my life, in fact, i was jolly and happy before the sensation. But i must say, that i was binge watching on crime vids on yt, where they discuss the criminal cases of people, and it did not affect me much, until the sudden feeling.Now, 2 days after the sensation, I no longer want to harm anyonez but yes, intrusive and poignant thoughts of arming myself are coming to me, and *do not* want to act on them. When I do not try to think about them, I am alright, but when I do, these symptoms come:Wanting to kill myself (i visibly try to shove this thought as i have no reason to do this)DiarrhoeaIncreased heart rateSomething, body shakingWanting to sleep a lot (which i like to avoid as then the depressing thoughts come back)Not wanting to speak muchUnable to concentrate/distract myselfI think i need professional help, but its too costly i guess i should speak to my fam about this, who have been very supportive of me. They will understand and try to help me. But if a psychologist or therapist here can please give me some advise on what to do, i would be very grateful.Peace and love. Is this a sudden depressive attack?",0
"Hey kind people, I randomly came across this sub and something hit me. I have been struggling to adjust after moving to a new city for the past few months, wake up tired every morning even if I go to bed early and sleep most of the day when I am not working or have school. I have zero motivation to do anything I used to enjoy. All my future plans and the things I was working hard towards just do not really mean anything anymore I just feel lost as hell and feel like I am in a middle of a life crisis. I had a break up and a year ago and it really affected my self esteem. I start univercity next year but really does not want to go there this miserable because I know it will affect my studies. I was wondering if it is depression because I can count how many times I have been happy the past few months and I really hate how I feel most of the time, I use day dreaming and weed now as a way to escape but every time reality hits harder. Thanks for listening to me ranting! Depression or just unhappiness?",0
"Its been years of depression. My upbringing was beyond fucked at some points. My last 3 bedrooms have looked like a fucking dump. One of which I have to have clean in 3 days, so I am far beyond overwhelmed right now. My mom went to prison and I have not seen her in well over a year because of covid. My life is a mess, I am in my early 20s but I have the work ethic and mentality of an 18 year old. I smoke weed, I binge drink, I do pills. I am not suicidal, but I would not mind dying that is for sure. Its amazing how much life can throw at you at once. I do not understand anymore.",0
"What do you do once you have become a terrible person as myself? The manipulator you swore never to become? When the few who love you are the ones you have fooled? I am an awful person. I have no feelings for one who loves me, but rather play along. I say empty words to everyone who values me. Love you too when I cannot find it in my heart to love anything anymore. Is it apathy? Maybe. Will I be missed? Likely. Missed as the person they thought they loved. Missed as some veiled liar. Ya know, they will have never seen it coming. It will be nice to be gone, false face and all. they would miss me. I will not miss them.",1
I have lost pretty much all of my friends. My boyfriend has just stopped interacting with me and blocked me on everything. I am going into year 11 and I still have no friends at my new school I just feel like a ghost 99% of the time . I have heard at least 11 people at my school saying racist shit. And loads of other stuff. I feel like killing myself but at the same time I do not want stuff to get worse for my siblings because of me. I do not know what to do anymore I am done,1
"I have depression and general anxiety and need a job that does not leave me by myself the whole time but is also not too fast paced and stressful that I get overwhelmed. It kind of seems like to me that when you ask for both of those things they do not really combine I would rather not be doing mindless tasks, as they really let my mind wonder making me kind of su\*cidal and dissociate. I am just so stumped on what to do. I want to get back out on the world and start living again but I do not know how to work around my depression and anxiety. Therapy and Medication has not worked so I need to do the best I can to at least get to a basic level of functioning again. I guess it is also worth mentioning that I am 19 and have like 0 interest in any field at all. I am really just looking for something I can get started on right nowHelp is really appreciated! cannot find a job that fits both depression and anxiety. Feeling stuck and need some suggestions please!!",0
"Yo! So, as the post says, got the coppers called on me while texting the crisis textline. Soooo the suicide hotline CAN track your location and apartment number. 6 fucking police officers knocked on my fucking door and I had to boldface lie to them, giving my preferred name and a dead number. Now to be fair, I am extremely exhausted of living and did some...questionable things, but I did not FUCKING MENTION THAT? Regardless, they came, I pretended to have no idea what was going on, but they took my \*fake\* name, real last name, DOB and dead number. Will they come back? I hope the fuck not. I am. So tired of trying. I am not trying the hotline anymore. I am just petrified they are going to come back. Got a nice lil team of coppers called on me a few nights ago when feeling low",1
"I am exhausted, with this obnoxious fucking pulse in my arm and with everything that ever represented me. I am supposed to turn 19 on the 30th. it was supposed to be the best year of my life. i promised myself. sick of living with constant anxiety, episodes of rage, extreme mood swings, obsession with drugs, and too many others to talk about right now. i have a full work week ahead (7 days) and I am tired. i do not want to show my face at a place where I am badgered by assholes about 10 extra cents on their purchase. i rarely get a day off anymore and while that is not the point of this post, I am completely spent with everything. the fucked up dynamic of my home life, my empty friendships, my mental state which most likely would never recover even if i did slither down to a hospital or a psychiatrist. i believe the world is only designed for certain people that accomplish certain things. you must be strong enough, you must be persistent. I have tried. and I have fantasized, for a long time. truth be told i doubt I am even strong enough to just finally get this over with already. i do not care if this comes and goes, i cannot cope anymore, i refuse, I am done. I am sorry everyone. knowing me ill probably be back, i really fucking hope not though. this may be it.",1

"that is it. I do not have friends. My last friend got away from me when my depression got really bad last month. One by one drifted apart from me when I was suffering.I never had a meaning for any of them. I feel alone. I wish I could obsess over something and not care about being alone. But it hurts. I wish I had someone to talk about random stuff.I am on antidepressants right now and the dose was increased so I am feeling a little numb, not as depressed and suicidal as I was last week.I do not know what to do.

I am delaying the inevitable, and I think honestly would be the best time to take myself out of this world. Anything I have attached myself to, or put work into has been a dismal failure. I do not see things getting much better for me.

I am not insulting anyone here, but for me, I am here for pity, and to feel like what I am doing is normal and okay. its not. I am 17, i do not want to waste my life away. I have wasted my teens years by almost never photographing myself, letting my teeth yellow, and isolating myself. i might reform this account into something better. i do not know, i just feel good. i brushed my hair and teeth, i washed my face, did laundry, cleaned up a bit, and I am about to take my sleep meds and hopefully rest. i want to make friends today. talk to the coworkers that I have convinced myself hate me. wear nailpolish and makeup that i like without being worried people will comment on it. i doubt the suicidal thoughts will go away without me talking to a professional, but I am just going to try to get better on my own terms, step by step, until i can convince my dad to let me see a doctor. ill try to be optimistic the highest day I have had in a lifetime of lows",1
"I am happy to be 21 now so I can drink myself to death everydayMy whole life never seemed to be great. My parents beat me and forced me to do things I did not want to do. I was the introvert Asian kid in school and got bullied a lot. It seems like growing up, I developed a very bad temper and I let negativity build up inside me for too long. I took drugs, committed a handful of crimes and lived a careless social life in high school because I needed to feel alive until I am not anymore. The first time I became suicidal was at age 12, and just got worse until after senior year. Every time I have finally achieved an intense relationship with a girl, I am head over heals until I am hanging by my neck with the world crashing down. I was kicked out of the house after graduating, so I was living from door to door at friends houses, probably people I should have stayed away from, then I met a girl. I decided to join the military to provide us a dream life together, but things just did not work out as she slept with my best friend and a guy next door in college while I was in basic training. While stationed, I got into trouble a lot and had no motivation to stay. I tried to commit suicide but I was revived and sent to a mental facility. Somehow I got back on my feet and the military gave me a second chance and since then, I have been improving. I need to stop looking at the past and trying to go back to it because in the end, I will feel like shit. Ill try to hit up old friends and they will not be interested. Honestly, any close friend is like family to me. And it sucks to not have anyone or anything to grow up with.Man.. time goes so slowly in the military but everyone else back home has changed significantly. I see my ex with a baby who is 3 years old now. My old friends have a whole college life completed and I am here, now, thinking of them from 4 years ago like it was yesterday.I do not know how to socialize with anyone anymore man.. I feel so fucking alone. I really am just a piece of shit World turning upside down",0

"I am just going to leave this here because it will be too long a read for most, but to those that do read it thank you for listening.My family has always had a difficult time in life, my father died when I was young, leaving my mother a widow with two young children. She worked two labour jobs to keep us fed and pay bills, as we got older we helped as much as could financially. Ill skip every detail, but a few years ago my sibling had made some poor decisions and it literally bankrupted my family. We lost everything, we were living in motels/hotels, I have even slept on floors of my friends, I have starved on occasions and its been tolling on my family. As a disclaimer we are a family of three, we do not have family or relatives to help us out, we had no friends because nasty rumours had circulated about my family. In no way do I blame them for making the mistake, I accept my situation, but recently its been too much for everyone.Then it happened the strongest woman I had ever known broke down, I have seen her cry on occasion due to my sibling and I arguing and it makes my mother feel like a failure on top of all that is going on, but today was like no other. I had always been depressed and when the times got too hard for us, I am so ashamed of myself, but I actually suggested that we take our own lives. I know its shocking and unfathomable, but we were all we had and I could not see the pain and suffering any longer. They said no obviously, but today my mom said she was ready to go because she does not have the will and spirit to keep fighting. To what she said we obviously denied her and told her it would be ok, but it took a lot out of me to hear where she is mentally. Were not suicidal, just tired of the situation because if you can imagine the worst case scenario, this is what it is. We have barely any money, no credit, no car, and currently in a bad housing situation that could end with us being evicted at any moment (home of my mothers half brother and his toxic wife). The backstory to that is that he had a heart attack and no one to care for him, we were asked to look after him, his wife wanted him dead so were at odds over that. Our current financial situation does not allow us to move, no credit to top it off. We pay for food for the whole household, another 4 people on the weekend, gas for the car you name it. Oh how I wish I could tell the whole story, its incredibly sad. The saddest thing happened today",0
I know they may isolate themselves from friends or even family. But romantic partners too? Should I just give mine some space? Is it common for people with depression to stop reaching out to their partners when going through a period of depression?,0
"I just want to type this all out because I truly do not know what else to do right now while I sit here contemplating everything. Basically TLDR; my wife has now given me an ultimatum of being in a poly dynamic or we split up. I love her so much, and she had alone given me so much more meaning in life when I met her and made me such a better person. I do not want to be without her no matter what that means but I want her to be happy too. Earlier this year she had been talking to an online friend about the idea of being with him and wanting to and started talking to me on the side bringing up what if we opened our relationship up and went through a lot of emotional and devastating talks about this and I was horribly depressed for months and even suicidal. Eventually she stopped talking to him at all for other reasons and I went to a psychiatrist because I have always had pretty severe depression but did not want to take medicine for it and had finally broken down and wanted to try it as a last resort type thing, like what if it really did all come down to a chemical imbalance. This surprisingly worked with no downside whatsoever and we talked more and more about the possibilities of being poly and I did a lot more researching and talking to people I knew who were in that lifestyle and agreed to give it a shot and thought that I actually did want it and it would be ok. I had been dating a girl for a little while and we have done sexual stuff and she was kind of dating this guy and they had not done anything serious. I noticed that when I did stuff with the new girl it just did not feel great for no reason whatsoever and I kept brushing it off as me being anxious over this new lifestyle. Yesterday my wife had finally told me that her and the guy she was dating did sexual stuff and at that moment, the one that I had thought about so many times to try to prepare myself for and thought I was for sure ok with, I absolutely broke down and told her that I cannot do this. None of my experiences with others have been good and I still cannot truly fathom how people can live this way. I just want her to love me and everything go back to the way it was before. Today while at work she sent me a wall of text essentially saying that I was the problem and that she is going to continue being poly but in the same breath saying how she loves me more than anything which makes zero sense. But it came down to we either stay poly or we split up so I do not see how she could love me more than anything but still prefer to divorce. Anyways I told her that I guess we are going to divorce then because she basically made the decision already but I truly cannot live on without what I had before. I truly felt like I was in heaven being with her all these years and was ready to tackle anything the future had but now thinking about being without her I am just ready for the end. I would love to do something that was more peaceful and painless like the exit bag method but it is now too time consuming and I want to be done soon. And if you read all this way through then understand that I know this has been all my fault for agreeing and getting involved with it and breaking down after hearing her. I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this, I promise, I just want out and she can live her life happily. Also, also, I know I have posted things in here before and obviously I got through them, majority having to do with the earlier in the year issues that went away and I got on medication, but this is different. Things are actually ending in my life and I cannot deal with it. Anyways, I think this truly is goodbye. I think I am finally going to do it (long story)",0

Went to the doctor and told them about my mental health issues. They put me in lexapro. I was always so scared to tell even anyone about my mental health and it felt good to finally do something about it. I am not out of the woods yet. But maybe I am on the right track I finally did it,0
"I hate myself. I do not take care of myself because I hate myself. I do not know how I got like this. Maybe my parents did not teach me its important to love yourself. Maybe the strict Christianity shoved down my throat made me think I have to make everyone else happy instead of myself. do not be selfish. Love thy neighbor. Maybe it was the years of physical, sexual, and mental abuse from my ex. you are just as worthless as I am. No one will ever love you. That is stuck in my brain forever after hearing it every day for years. But I did not care about myself enough even then because I let him do all of that to me. So it started before that. Why is my brain wired like this? Am I destined to kill myself? Sometimes I believe I am. I give out so much love but I cannot love myself. Why? I do not know how to love myself.",1

"my name is nissa jones and I am 18 years old (my english is not great, sorry) . currently, it is 11:44pm as I am writing this. when i was 6 years old, i had sex with my big brother (he was 10) and it continued till i was 12 years old. i used to idolize my big brother a lot and did everything he said even though i knew it probably was not ok. when i figured out what we were doing was wrong and i did not want to do it anymore, he used to bargain with me to have sex with me by saying ""if you \[do something gross\] you can play with me"", or ""if you do this i will draw"", etc, etc. i did it and it made me feel dirty and guilty every time. i was not able to tell my parents and I am still not able to. he still lives with us and everyday it feels like i have to peel my skin off me, i really feel so dirty and disgusting. I have been homeschooled all my life, i have no irl friends, i have no one to talk to except online friends but even they are not around. they do not care if i feel this way. because of this I have resulted to self-harming to where it turned to tiny scratches then bruises, then cuts, then both, etc. i had a boyfriend online but talking to him is like talking to a wall. he was there, he bought me things. it was nice. until it was not anymore. he is a good person but my mind is not in the right place to be with someone so loving and it makes me feel guilty for dragging it so long and making him feel like it is all his fault. i really am a terrible person. i recently got a job that i was excited for but today was something bad. i was working with my coworker carlos and i asked if he wanted to be friends and shook his hand but i did it too long and it was so awkward. he made this weird look at me and it was the same look my brother had. it was gross. i felt gross. i went to the bathroom and i cut myself over and over i always wear long sleeves so no one knew. I have thought about suicide for a long time but each time i had a bit of hope things will get better or things will turn around, you know, classic sayings like that. things never got better, things never will get better, and no one can save me. i can only save myself but i cannot even do that, so what is the point? I am making this for just one ounce of hope from anyone because truthfully i do not want to think this way... i just wanted to be normal and do normal things. I am overweight, my skin is so dark and dirty, everything around me is dirty, my house, my dogs, my room, everything. everything is so filthy and gross. I am so filthy and gross. my parents do not care for me or how i feel neither do the people around me. i thought maybe if i died they will finally see me for who i really am. and maybe they will. goodbye suicide note",1
"I do not feel myself alive for a long time, no matter what i do. I have no desires for suture anymore, and no desire to continue this worthless and painful travel forwards. Nothing to live for - I have none of those reasons to live which you all read a lot in posts and on websites. My thoughts are about death, my night dreams are often about death. I have no desire to go further with life - to plan something, to do something, to dare... I am tired of it.I hope I will find strength to end my life this Summer. Then I will have peace and rest finally. I almsot feel that I should have killed myself long ago",1
"Hi everyone, My situation was really cool, I was happy boy until being 16-17 years old when I discovered my biological sex is different than mental sex. Wearing woman clothes, makeup, doing things like woman makes me really happy and feel normal compared to being in unnatural male body.Unfortunately, noone around me, can understand this.I had many friends before, now I am talking maybe with one or two, mainly about stupid things.Everyone else thinks I am weird even my parents, who make fun I do not have girlfriend and look more like woman than man. Idk what to do, I would love to make full transition, but it is really expensive and risky. I do not have anyone to talk about that and besides moments being woman( wearing sexy clothes, makeup and getting attention), I am constantly sad and often crying. I do not even know any girls with I could talk about feminine things like makeup and fashion.What do you think I should do with my life? If anyone would like to talk with me, it would be cool ;) I do not know what to do anymore",0
"I think I am autistic. I am tired of trying to diagnose myself because my parents did not care to. I dissociate all day. I do not want to be alive anymore. Autism comes with a huge stigma that I do not want and cannot handle. But I do not think I can continue without help. Which means getting diagnosed, or going to therapy, or something. I cannot tell anyone. My mom would never believe me. I cannot even think straight. I am so depressed. I want my life to be over. I do not want to have to fight my way through life anymore.

Nobody get me out of there, outside of the close family they do not even believe me, my own grandmother blame me for my own abuse and talk like her son of 70 year old is the victim or his daughter of 16 year old. 10 years like this of developing mental illness because of this asshole and now I do not want to stay at this place that never been a home to me and who will help me? Who? I rather die. I do not want to keep living just to be fucked over by people because that is all they have to give me. I do not want to be alive because being alive mean being vulnerable to suffering and I do not want to suffer anymore. I have enough to try to live. Life obviously do not want me and I am tired to try. I wish I never been born",1

"literally everyone i talk to now lacks so much fuckin empathy and it depresses me so fucking much. the fact that you can get away with shit for being good looking or whatever is horrible. and that people will support you because of that. NOBODY cares how you look, how young you are, and if you think its funny to do dumb shit, you are a horrible person. what makes me angrier is the fact that there are people on this earth waiting for the world to collapse, as if its a good thing. humanity is fucked, grow up, do not hope for shit to get worse, get off your fuckin ass and actually do something. anyways, that is just a random set of thoughts in my head, that is all. what the actual fuck happened to having empathy?",0
"By all rights, I should be an adult, I am 23 ffs. But I am Bipolar, anxious, and terrified of the family I am dependent on. Lying is my defense mechanism, my way to ensure that even though the future will probably suck, I can at least sleep for another night. Ironically, when I tell them the truth, I am told I am a liar, an attention whore; I am the paradoxical pathological liar. One of my major lies, something nobody else really had any business knowing, is on the cusp of being found out. In all likelihood, this will be the final straw, and I will be cut off. I cannot say I would blame them, nobody wants a family member who constantly has problems. I suppose the best way is to just accept it, and take whatever happens next. Between a rock and a hard place, the only option is to be crushed.",0

"How do I figure out if I deserve help. I mean mostly deserve a therapist's time to work with a patient. Do I deserve their time regardless of the money I pay them? I just have too many questions for them.Also does it sound illogical when I say that I do not want to take deep breaths and calm myself---because that means ignoring the anxiety, and treating it like something that is overreacting, that needs to be fixed. Treating the anxiety as wrong/not okay. I thought you should treat the anxiety as a friend and live with it. Not shush it from the conscience. Thanks. Do I deserve help",0

"I do not know who I am talking to, but sorry for so many posts lately. I have been more active on this sub in the last month than I have been on all of Reddit in years.I think I just need someone to say this to while I figure things out.I have been dealing with suicidal ideation for almost 15 years. I can tell anyone the story of how when I was 12 years old I realized that dying would not bother me, but that is not what this is about. My life since then has always gone impulses, brief periods where I will be okay and productive, followed by increasingly longer and darker cycles where I am down, sad, depressed, unreachable, easily offended, and just generally not the kind of person I ever pictured I would be. And, because I have been dealing with this for so long, I know how to handle these periods, and I have always managed to cling through. I went through a really bad one a couple of years ago, which actually led to my first-ever post on this site, but I made it.But this time feels different. It started a little over two months ago, and drastically got worst a couple weeks back. Something about this does not feel like the norm, where I will think about ending it, imagine what life would be without me, and eventually snap out of it. Something about this feels more serious, more accepting. None of my old methods are working. When I try to make lists of people who will miss me, I said come up with list about how they would react to hearing killed myself, and cannot find anything that is motivating me to stay. When I try to think about everything that I be giving up if I were to end my life, like the show arcs that I will never get to finish, or the paintings I will never get to lay to canvas, none of it is enough to make me want to stay.Nothing is working. It scares me that I have reached this point of acceptance, because this does not feel like a hypothetical wondering of what life would be like if I were not part of it. I am starting to feel an acceptance seep into my bones, and I worry that I am not going to make it to my 28th birthday next year . . . Which has been my goal since I was 18.I do not know what I hope to come out of posting on here, but I guess I just wanted to be able to say to someone. I do not have any friends or family I can talk to you. do not get me wrong, I do have them, but none of them want to hear my problems, and those who do one understand it. I am not saying it is definitely going to happen, but I am saying that I am getting really scared, and to feel alone, and I think I know what is coming, and I am not sure what to do.Does anyone else know this? Have any of you managed to find your way back? Because I am at the point where I am deliberately taking long lunches on the roof so that here soon I can 'slip' and leave this place without anyone having to know that I chose to go.I am so lost. I Hope I Make It To The Day I am 28 Years Old",1
"Its been a year since I left college due to a lot of shit happening in my life. When the pandemic first began I resorted to online classes. It was not so bad at first. And I was going to continue in the fall 2020 but in the past years summer my grandfather died. It was hard for me to process all of this. I could have kept going but I choose not to.Deep down I really want to be someone in life. I want to continue with my studies and be successful again. I was a straight A student when I first attended community college and graduated with top honors. After transferring to uni my first semester there sucked. I was struggling despite my efforts, the advisors did not really cared what classes I took and even misguided me on the classes I was not suppose to take, etc. I left that school because I knew I was not happy so I left and went back to my community college to make up for my poor performance. That was all before the pandemic began.My depression has been holding me back. I do not know who I want to be but I am willing to work hard again. Even one of my old teachers who I keep in touch with agrees that I should dust myself off and move forward with who I want to be. How do I figure out what I want to be and leave the past behind? I quit school over a year ago due to death in the family admits the pandemic. Am I failure to leave school behind? Could I ever go back and figure out who i want to be?",0
So. Gf leaving me. Practically already ex but looking for another place to leave before ending officially for good. No job. Nothing good really happening. Considering going to a psychologist but cannot feel like that would happen since I am usually depressed when it is good but at least now I have lots of reasons to be depressed about. Still hanging. No pun intended. Just feel like there is no actual reason for me to mind dying or to continue alive. I do not feel alive.Just wanted to vent a little. If anyone reads this please write anything below...just to know that someone out there is reading. I will probably look for a good psych...I feel dragged to the ground more and more...and do not want that I want to be cremated. Not really suicidal ...but yeah?,1
"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",0
"Struggled immensely with Bipolar last year, specifically between July and December. After that, things had been good and I was doing well in life. July this year, and around the same dates surprisingly, my hope has plummeted again and depression is taking over. The reason is my career. My undergrad is in a niche background, yet not something which has no jobs whatsoever. I was willing to shift to a somewhat generic field for my masters ie management. Hailing from India, I have seen insane competition and quite a lot of suppression as well. In India, the most popular choice of degree (let us not take the name here) has people who have no motive behind this degree and literally try their hands in every single field where there is money and ease of jobs despite the relevance. This makes it so much harder for passionate people of that field to succeed. Henceforth, I have been quite entailed in constant depression and anxiety, only enhanced by my mental illness. I have a lot of ambitions, and its a rather courageous move in India to follow your own path. I now feel scared that I might not even be able to survive my parents and will have to struggle for peanuts of money. A rather small hope still pertains yet I am sure it will die soon, and with it I as well. Exactly after one year again, suicide seems like a good option",1
"This will be my 5th therapist. Idk how I can ever be normal again. On paper, I really am a crazy person. If I were smart enough I would program me a bot that can act as my therapist. I just need someone to tell lots of shit to and occasionally talk back. Therapy is tricky though because each time they hit a wall with me and I can tell they have lost all interest and they run out of things to say and just bs. So it always ends the same but I need someone to talk to and at the same time I just want nothing Think I might need therapy again but it always ends the same",0

I have been trying to work on myself the past months. realized that it was so hard to start a conversation and trust another human being. it was so hard to establish a connection or a relationship when you had first hand experience of many years long lasting ones that just suddenly cut you off after one mistake. to be honest i am still trying to forgive myself for what happened. what am i saying? I am saying thank you to reddit. thank you for suicidewatch for being an avenue i can release and people can comment. life really does not get better but you really do move and eventually heal.life is meant to give you crap, the way you handle it is the key to true happiness. i will come back with updates on my feelings in a couple of months. for now, i hope you whoever is reading this is safe. life does not get better, you get better",1

"Idk why I still bother to reach for help when i know nobody can truly help me. I suppose it is just better to get it out of my head. I seriously feel like I might act on my thoughts. My mental health has declined dramatically and I find myself losing control more frequently and for longer periods of time. I have made plans and they are always the same plan. it is just a matter of having the right combination of circumstances active at the right time for me to act on it. I have reached out for medical help but the truth is, nobody will really do anything unless you are about to act on it that very second you call or until it is too late. I get into strange headspace where I do not really have control of myself and that is when I act strange and am likely to act on it. So I will not ring anyone or ask for help in those time... which makes it more scary because i do not truly want to die. There is nothing i can do. Sometimes I think maybe I should stop trying to help myself and just let it happen because I am sick of being stuck where I am right now I do not know why I am writing this",1
"I had a test today that has been on the schedule for three weeks. I studied and studied and stressed over it to the point where my period was late for 7 days which has never happened before. It was all I could think about. After the flight (it was a flight test, in the air, I am an aviation major) when my instructor told me hes not passing me on the test, the disappointment I felt in myself was so immense. It took every thing I had not to burst into tears while he went through the flight and detailed every single thing that I did wrong. I tried so hard for this test, everybody I talked to about it said you will do great! you always do! you got this! it will be amazing! and I think that is another reason it hit me so hard , bc I was so fucking embarrassed. I do not fail things. The whole time he was talking I just could not stop the thoughts of how worthless and stupid I was. It just kept repeating itself over and over in my head, his mouth kept moving saying the reasons why I failed and my brain kept telling me that I should just kill myself there is no point in trying so hard if this is the result, I wanted to hurt myself so so so bad. For some reason there is a sharp blade in my car and a few weeks ago I discovered that its very effective in making myself bleed. Its kind of like a scalpel? Again, I do not know why its there but it is (I think its like an eyebrow shaper or something my sister left in there??) but anyways it was basically all I could think about. When I left, of course, as soon as I got in the car I could not stop the tears from falling, any sort of negative feedback from a parent, teacher, colleague, etc always hits me so hard. I HATE being critiqued bc I am a perfectionist so there is usually nothing to critique. But anyways I kept myself from cutting somehow, the scars have been adding up and I do not want anybody finding out, there is only so many times you can blame it on the cat, or a branch, or the dog, whatever. I still had to release that disappointment in myself though so I ended up slapping myself a lot which ofc made things worse. and my face still hurts. Lol the amount of times I almost flipped my car on the highway tho on the way back to my apt, man Ill tell ya, it was difficult to not. My dog is the only reason I am alive I swear, thinking about him was the only thing that kept me going. When I got back I cried some more then fell asleep next to my doggo. I still feel worthless and the thoughts are terrible in my head and I wish I were dead but here I am venting to random strangers on reddit bc I feel guilty thinking about how my family would react if they found out I was dead. Its not fair that I am alive right now, I do not want to be, so why do I have to suffer for the next eighty years. I think deep down its why I chose to become a pilot, so I could kill myself easily if I needed to. If my family were all dead, god, I would jump off a bridge so fast. Anyways, moral of this story which is my life is think twice before you fail a student or tell someone something bad about them, you do not know their frame of mind and you may just be the reason they needed to kill themselves. This is not even a fiftieth of all the reasons I want to die, but the fact that just failing this test which I can retake btw, triggered me so much, I just do not want to do life anymoreI have a head ache from crying so much its so weird I almost never cry but lately its been happening a lot more. I think my body and will are starting to give up on my mental state so its not holding the tears back any more idk idk why does crying feel so terrible",1

So if god is so much loving as he claims to be why would he create such an horrible place where we all have to kill each other to survive? Plus why is life so cruel for so many of us? This system only favor a few at the top and the rest are thrash basically. And look who are the richest people alive. All of them are assholes who built their fortune by exploiting dirt cheap labor in under developed countries. It feels like the only way to come on top of the food chain is to be the ultimate asshole. And the last thing, if we somehow disagree with this system and do not want to be part of it, the only way out seems to be suicide, which is a very painful and traumatic way to end it. So most of us hate this place but we stay alive because suicide is very painful and traumatic. And really who knows if the pain stops after death? Because that is another thing... we do not even know why we are here and what is next. Are we in Hell?",1

I do not get why good people who have lots of other who love them have to get unlucky and die in a car crash or something. Why cannot I just get unlucky and die in an accident so I can just be gone. No one will remember me it does not matter. Why cannot I just die,0
"I have been struggling with depression for my whole life and I have never had a girlfriend.I can suspect many reasons (but I do not really know the true answer) but the bottom line is it is never happened for me...I have never had the timing/luck to catch women when they are available...they are always taken. I have heard all ""the right person will come to you when you least expect it"" and other such nonsense...I do not believe in it...I am not that lucky.it is very hard meeting someone when you have depression/anxiety disorder. it is so hard to get the kind of confidence that women demand, and/or risk rejection and get the little esteem you have blown away. it is even harder to put on a fake display of pretening to be a happy version of yourself when deep inside I am screaming. And to keep doing this all the time, everytime.For those of you who have (or ever had) a gf or bf at one point, how did you manage to find yourself in a relationship? It is such a curiosity to me. I feel like I am missing out of what others describe as such a 'rich and fulfilling experience'...which adds to depressive state that I have never gotten there. But still, I would like to know. How did you get the courage to ask him/her out? How did you make it work? Question for depressed people who have (or ever had at some point) a gf or bf.",0
"I have squandered most of my opportunities in life and i feel like a loser because I am. I was a high school athlete and I was a very social person growing up. Now, just turning 30 I have dropped out of college/university twice and only have a diploma in music production which makes me extremely overwhelmed and anxious anytime I even attempt to make anything. I was in Human resources last year and missed one course on my final semester so i never graduated. I hated the curriculum anyways... bunch of cucklord social justice bs... I am kind of at the end of my ropes now though. I am 30 years old and feel like a huge loser. I moved back in with my parents who are constantly trying to get me to move out again and telling me to go take school or another program that i have no idea if I should take or not. Life is slowly falling apart around me. My parents are getting older and life feels like it is getting worse every day. I am in Canada and cannot even buy a gun to die. Part of me does not want to die because I do not want to fuck up everyone else's lives around me but nothing seems to help me get better. I am starting to lose faith in myself and my ability to move forward. The only friends who i occasionally talk to drink alcohol all day and smoke weed/play video games. They are complete losers. I used to do shit like this but I do not want to do this shit anymore. I feel like I have no idea how to get better. I am tired and exhausted and things just are not enjoyable. Medication also does not seem to work for me. I get bad anxiety on antidepressants and yea... I also used to experiment with a lot of mdma and smoke a ton of pot over 5 -10 years ago when i was first in University and I think that might have fucked me up as well. Life just sucks man... I legit have no clue wtf to do anymore. I am 30 and probably should be taking a job working at starbucks... fuck. I wish i had some support and any advice for someone on how i can turn my life around.... Fuck... I have also tried stopping watching porn and doing that and I think that definitely helps. I really hope life gets better for me. I have a hard time even trusting any people anymore because I have had some fucked up experiences with other crazy people who used me and took advantage of me. I am not sure i can recover I feel like I have squandered all my opportunities in life and I am ready to die. Just turned 30 and life seems pretty pointless for me now",1
"Everything just feels so hopeless. The days are all blending together. Two weeks passes in the blink of an eye and I still have not left my apartment, still working from home,still broke. I spend every day doing the same thing. I hate my at home job so much when I am through with work I either sleep or just stare at the ceiling. I have no joy anymore or any will to engage in my passions/hobbies. My most exciting outing the pst few months was getting a tooth pulled. I do not leave my apartment because I have no friends and anything I need I can get delivered. My job is basically to be a verbal punching bag since I work for a corrupt company. I have spent many nights longing for a friend willing to check in on me or come see me. No new messages, read one week ago. I have just come to accept no matter how hard I try I will never have friends. If it were not for my boyfriend who lives with me I would have ended it a while ago he is the only thing that takes my loneliness away even for a moment. But even he has no clue what goes through me head every day and I am getting worse. Time is standing still",0

Its the weekend and everyone celebrating tonight only I got home from tiring long hours work ready tosleep but the people downstairs have to make money and celebrate so they have this festival outside my room. Loud booming sounds and I cannot sleep giving me migraine lies lies lies the fucking complex lease I signed told me not till many months it will be festival. Damn right not but it means it will be 20 times worse that this.As I sat in the toilet feeling defeated. I got too depressed and just began crying how I hated people and the way they inconvenience me and yet I equally hate myself more that I want the butcher to use the cow gun directly in my forehead. Why do I even matters.I hate myself so much and I am too old and tired I am too afraid to die yet when I think of it I have no life. My life has no meaning. I having nothing to live for day by day by day I routinely do the chores repeatedly and I just want the day to end and then have to do it over again but for what.I do not have family at my age I am too old and I am even infertile soon or now.I am never going to be normal I was never normal.I was brought to the us illegally and that fucked up my life over and over. I have so many problems in high school but because I am illegal I cannot tell the reason for my problems.Because well get deported. I am now a us citizen but fuck it all. My life has not changed one bit. In fact its too late now all my hopes and dreams.I should have just drank the bleach and let them euthanized me. The nurse almost killed me before too much anesthesia I could not breathe I should have just let it all in and die.I should have just died. I do not know what is the point of my existence.I love someone who cannot love me.She is the only reason and she does not even know my existence.I do not know I really do not knowIm so stuck in the mud.I say I do not wait for storm to pass. I wait for the storm in this sinking boat to take me with it.Fuck me for being a failure.I wish all these are just nightmares and when I wake up I am already dead. Its just me,1

"I was diagnosed with chronic depression when I was 8, since then its only gotten worse. I am 19, hopefully soon to be a sophomore in college but my grades were so bad last year that its up in the air whether or not I am keeping my financial aid. I just got kicked out of my student Microsoft account so I have to call them tomorrow, if they tell me its because I lost my financial aid I think that will be it for me. I am only alive for my dog, at this point I know he would be better off without me, he just does not know it because I am all hes ever had. No one, friends, family, professionals, takes me seriously. I am numb most of the time now, I do not think I can really feel positive emotions for more than a few minutes when I am sober. I got my EMT certification but I want to move away before I start to practice, I wanted to get my paramedics before I left but if I lose my financial aid I cannot go back this semester. I do not have nearly enough money to leave this god forsaken state and I just got fired for something stupid so its not like I can save up. I finally worked up the ability to call a psychiatrist and they hung up on me when I was put on hold and no one has called me back almost a week later. I am spiraling, every night is just distracting myself from downing my pill bottle. I do not want to keep going, the only thing keeping me here is my dog and the fear that what comes next could be worse. This life has nothing for me, even if I end up making something out of myself Ill never be able to enjoy it. I do not recognize myself, my eyes look dead and I can barely eat. I am mostly living off of water and green tea water bottles, I do not have the energy to leave my bed more than an hour or two total everyday to pee and exchange a few words with my mom or grandma. I am just waiting for something to push me over the edge, it was not getting the repressed memories of my molestation back, it was not getting fired for the first time, it was not getting hung up on while trying to get help, I feel like its coming soon and I am too tired to keep asking for help. I am not planning on living past 29 unless I can find something worth living for, that gives me 10 years but I know I will not make it that long. I have no one that loves me besides my dog, hes old so he will not be around much longer either. I know for a fact that when I find his body Ill be gone before the end of the night, I cannot exist for myself and there is no way Ill ever find a dog good enough to replace him. I do not know why I am writing this, maybe its just something so no one can say they did not see the signs after I am gone, maybe I am looking for support or understanding, idk. Maybe I just wanted to talk. How am I supposed to keep going when I know it does not get better?",0

"Hi all,Let me introduce myself. I am a 22y old male student. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder back in 2016 and since then I have been on meds ( antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizators ).Lately, I have been without will to study and I have been feeling really lazy and with some intrusive thoughts that are common for OCD. As of today I have been smoking a pack or more of cigarettes a day. All of what I do during the day comes down to eating and smoking and sleeping. I do not feel happy with my life. I may lose my scholarship for university and I only did one exam in two months. I am worried is this may be a sign of depression?Thanks to all who read and reply! Is this depression?",0

"So I have been a long time reader on here and I figured this would be the best place for help.So about four months ago I started feeling aloof, I guess you would call it, but I have been feeling worse and worse. All the things that used to really make me feel good now just kind of feel like chores. Never really feel like leaving my room. I am 28 this month and I am not sure if I am just feeling down or if depression is what I am experiencing. I have had periods like this in the past but I have been told there is no reason for me to be depressed and usually I take it on the chin and keep walking forward because that is ""what I am supposed to do"". do not really have any real friends so any advice would be much appreciated I could use some perspective",0
I have an odd thing going on. I never have any motivation to do very much but now I am currently very suicidal and also motivated to follow through. Just out of hospital and wanting to do a better job of it next time I try. I do have people in my life to live for but I do not have any hope for the future. I think the people I love would be better off without me they just do not realise it but would when I died. I need help,1

"Been struggling for 10 years with depression, always somehow managed to function. But it is coming back stronger than ever. I just feel so tired all the time and nothing brings me joy. My plants died, my instruments gathers layers of dust and instead of enjoying a game I sit in front of my Playstation and stare into the black until it is time to go to bed. Not that I am able to sleep but I am allowed to lay there.I feel empty. I just started changing my life, doing things I had been waiting years for and now that I am able to do this - nothing. Just nothing. I somehow wish my house would burn down. Or a car would take pity on me while I cross the street. I do not feel strong enough to make a change. I am a loser that cannot be grateful for anything and I know it could be way worse. But that is not making it easier for me.I am just deadly tired. it is coming back and everything's too much",0
So I have been struggling with depression for some time. Last year it hit a head when I actually attempted suicide. The problem is that one of my hobbies was rifle shooting. I even had a custom made $1000 rifle I assembled myself. I am a rather skilled marksman (markswoman?) but obviously having guns around is dangerous for me. I ended up selling my guns to a friend. Now my question is a similar but safer hobby I might be able to take up. I am thinking of getting back into archery but I wanted to make this post to see if anyone else had other ideas for a safe hobby like rifle shooting. Want to keep my hobby.,0

"My safe option was always by drug overdose. My moms a doctor so that should be easy. Nuh-uh, not easy at all, do not recommend. Its been 3 days and I still feel like shit, my hearts beating like crazy and I can barely move without getting dizzy. I did NOT sign up for this. I want to kill the pain not because it. I thought I was just going to sleep then not wake up. Well I did wake up and now I have diarrhoea. Are you kidding me? Most of the other methods are way too painful and dangerous if I do not succeed. What I took was supposed to be lethal for an adult and I am barely a teenager. Goddamn immune system. I probably will not try for a while, I do not want to feel like this again. I hate this. Why is killing yourself so damn hard",0
"I do not want to bore anyone with the details of how it came to this, but two friends of mine turned on me in a truly humiliating and nasty way using something I never actually did as an excuse (they said I fat shamed an actor's girlfriend- I did no such thing, I have struggled with EDs myself, I do not do that shit to other people) several years ago.This was traumatic and frightening, it just cane out of absolutely nowhere. They accused me of manipulating then by saying I felt suicidal, that I was fucking mean and horrible person. Just imagine being flayed alive while people scream insults at you and you get the idea.The only reason I never killed myself at that time was because my mum was recovering from some major surgery, so I moved back home for a bit. But none of this has ever truly gone away. They were able to keep track of my movements, which perplexed me because I blocked every account of theirs I was away of.Tl;Dr one of them had an account I discovered by accident. The one she proudly proclaims herself an MD. A doctor took part in this bullshit. 1I also found out I was not the only one the main/head bully had done this two. that is what motivated me to expose her and warn others......well, that plan failed worse then a second hand condom. Nobody wanted to know. They did not care. She was nice and polite to them, so I must be a liar. It really does feel like fucking high school. Everyone loved the main bully too...until she finally fucked up and they kicked the shit out of her. It just makes me feel I have had enough. The world is cruel, does not give a single shit about any of us. My dad is trying to persuade my mum to kick me out (even though he does not live with us ffs). I have nothing and nowhere to go. it is really feeling like the end of the line.Apologies for incoherence, I took a load of codeine and valium before writing this so it may make no sense.

I have been writing suicide notes to my family and friends for months. Every time I do I have meant it. I have written my last one. I have said what I need to. I am actually ok with dying.

"I have been wanting to leave this world ever since I was 13. I am 25 now and every year since then it is only gotten worse. It first started when I was 13 and realized I was gay and even then I knew what that meant. I knew I would be hated, despised by society and viewed as a subhuman. And I know that even more today. That remains the biggest reason why there is no hope for me. I am not going to change the world or society, if I were to end things, it would technically be a moral good since I would be ridding society of someone they think is an ""evil, subhuman, satanic, degenerate"". So there is that, and that alone is reason enough. Then there is the fact that I am a fat, ugly pos, basically an incel. Never even had a friend. Have worked stupid dead end jobs, cannot get ahead financially. I am a total failure and have succeeded at nothing. And sometimes I do not think I deserve to. Wtf is the point? I am already 25, cannot change most things even if I wanted to. I have 1 serious attempt in the past and it came very close to succeeding but i really do not want to risk it again. Idk why society wants to hate people then not even provide them a safe, reliable, medical option to leave this place. Feeling like leaving for 12 years",1
"I am a straight cis male, but I am sexually submissive. I do not feel as though my sexual interests make me not a real man or anything, but they make me extremely frustrated because I know that sexually dominant women are more or less non-existent. If you search femdom or Dominatrix on /r/AskWomen, you will be meet with how women feel about female domination; the overwhelming majority of them say they would have to immediately break up with a male partner who was into Femdom. The only context in which this exists is with a professional Dominatrix, and even most of them when interviewed admit they do not get aroused by their work at all.Women sometimes flirt with me at bars and are confused when I show no interest in them, but really I am just trying to protect them from forming a connection with me, only to find that I am sexually submissive. I am a decently attractive guy and extroverted with a healthy social life, but I am terrified of women because I know they will be terrified and turned off by my sexual interests",0

"In my early thirties now. Born with bilateral cryptorchidism and I do not produce male sex hormones.

Psychiatric problems throughout my twenties, did not week help until I was 25. Bipolar, ptsd, depression. Like I said I am in my mid thirties now. Poor as hell my entire life. No one is REALLY helping. It all just seems superficial. I know I have had good friendships but currently all my friendships are absent or not really conducive. I do not see a future where I am happy and thriving. I am on vrylar , lipitor, and testosterone. Doc wants to put me on Prozac. I do not want prozac. I just want my material conditions to get better.

"let us face it, there is very little good in the world. The things that keep us going is just some false hope that things will get better but they do not get better. The world is a cold place, one where nobody gives a fuck about you.. Nobody truly understands you, we are alone inside our heads, trapped in a prison of torment, a merry-go-round of hell.. The only reprieve is from drugs, but the price for that is more future torment. it is like a sick joke.. To believe otherwise is just burying my head in the sand. it is comforting to believe in positivity, but it is also comforting to believe in fairy tales.. I cannot live and I cannot die. I am barely carrying on. Every time I start picking up the peices, life knocks them back down again.. After years and years I have come to realize that this is my destiny. My only fear is that death brings no respite, only deeper versions of hell.. To ""see the positive in things"" is delusional..",1
"I just want to know what its like, just fucking once. I have gone my whole fucking life without it. My dad hit me more times than he hugged me. My mum did not give two shits about me, tried to kill herself 3 times before I even turned 12 just to prove that point. And that is not to mention all the other shit they both put on me. Never even had friends growing up, moved around too much, just did my best to assimilate with new groups by wearing masks and leaving them behind just as quickly.Only ever had one friend in adulthood. Think she did care about me for a while, but I fell in love with her and she did not feel the same way. Between that and my constant mentally ill bullshit, guess I scared her away because she is barely spoken to me at all for almost 2 years now and I have not seen her in just as long.Never had a girlfriend either. cannot imagine it would be anything but a total fucking disaster and I do not think I can handle losing someone I actually care about because of my own bullshit again. Tried using shit like Tinder but it fucking sucks. Besides, I know I am not good enough for a relationship so what the fuck am I even trying to accomplish by asking women out? Sex is just fucking pointless to me at this point so I really do not know what the end goal is and I just stop bothering.I know people say you have got to love yourself first but I do not know what the fuck that feels like because I have nothing to go off. Feels like I am caught in an endless cycle of cannot be loved till I love myself and cannot love myself until I learn what being loved is like. Its fucking torture. do not even think it fucking matters anymore, think I have lost the ability to be around people anymore anyway. cannot handle it. Every time I have tried to make myself be around people or make new friends I just get fucking agitated with everyone and want to be left the fuck alone. cannot even hold down a job anymore because I cannot speak to the public on a regular basis without doing shit that gets me fired. People just aggravate me and I do not know how to fix that. Medication does not fix it, does not do fucking anything, neither does therapy. Guess there is no solution.Just so fucking sick of being completely alone in the world, having to do all this shit by myself every fucking day, with nothing ever getting better or easier. And its a fucking catch 22 because the longer this shit goes on the harder it gets to be around anyone, the worse my truest issues get and the more I realise I am probably always going to be fucking unstable to some degree and Ill never be good enough to have relationships and shit because I have got nothing to offer but chaos and self-destruction. I just wish one fucking person loved me",0
"# Freedom is an illusion. Money buys an illusion of freedom. To me I define freedom, doing whatever you want without suffering non of the consequences...but the way this system has been designed is that there is one group controlling the other.Whatever social group you associate yourself with. If you do find freedom, eventually religion will find a way to steal it by breaking the law so they can run a story on you or sending someone from the darkweb to steal your hard earned money so the big media companies can run a story on you on how deeply flawed you are and how perfect they are.Women control the world and the internet including the darkweb and deep web and I2P and the entire financial market.You are a slave so get used to it because women are crazy and men are stupid. why you have no freedom",0

"I have think I have become delusional. I honestly and truly believe that everything bad that has ever happened, all of people's suffering, all the negativity, all the death and the suffering, all the problems in our society and our nature, all the toxicity is my fault. I still have enough sanity left to know how stupid such a thing is. I tried and tell someone this and they just said to stop being overdramatic and silly. Well guess what. Silly is all I fucking am. it is all this stupid low IQ post from a low IQ dumbass is. I do not know what the fuck I am even looking for anymore, absolutely fucking nothing makes me happy not even self harming because I just know everything I do is completely fucking pointless. I am a blistering sore on everyone around me I know all I do is bring forth negativity and yet I cannot even rid them of me because for some damn reason I think at least someone in my family will grieve for me. What should I do if I kill myself will the suffering around me stop or will it just be another stupid action of mine that causes even more suffering? Help me.",1
"I have dealt with depression pretty much my whole life, I am 34 now. let us get some basics out of the way: single, manager at an office for a bank, short enough to be self conscious about it, and just getting sober from weed.I am trying to clean the house because mom is visiting soon, but damn, I can barely do anything because nothing at this moment seems worth it. that is a familiar feeling, but it is hitting hard. I know I will work tomorrow, but when I am done... maybe exercise (that is not a big deal to me, it is more of a habit now anyways), but otherwise I just cannot function.I was supposed to be productive because weed was making me guilty for not improving my life, which needs it... but now I am not doing anything and I am completely sober. That depression is hitting hard again and I am trying to not numb it. I cannot say weed is a factor here, but I am thinking it is definitely one of them. Now I am feeling guilty again, but without the substance to block it out. I will not go back to drinking casually by myself (thank you green for helping, I admit that), but... shit man. Quitting green should not be this hard. I have cold turkey addy abuse before, and even then I was getting brain shocks from that, but those have ceased long ago thankfully. Scary shit.I cannot get out of my head that my 34 year old life can be fixed. I compare myself to everyone and just talk myself down about it to a terrible fault, but I just want to be happy and achieve my goals. Now I am back to scratching that spot on my head, dreading tomorrow.it is not like I am stupid... in some sense. Got the degree (yup, psych), dropped out of grad school, got a real estate license and personal training cert basically on a whim (both expired because I hate the selling). So I start and give up rather easily. My dream is to become an author. I know, overdone, but I cannot help it, I enjoy making a world and spooky stories and that is what makes it a dream, to at least live off that. Whenever I get someone to read something, I feel like I am forcing them to give me compliments, so now I have not touched my laptop (except for paying bills) in almost a year. I cannot continue this life in this state. In this state of having customers yell at me over the phone, constantly beating myself up, and knowing that tomorrow, I will not be able to improve. I would appreciate some input, or something nice? Ha. I am sure if you are reading this, you have an idea of why I am writing this. But it is not healthy. I take 20mg fluoxetine, but I cannot feel it. When I went up 40mg I felt terrible, so that is was not good. Anyways, thank you for letting me get this out. I cannot convince myself that my life will get better, and that is making me believe nothing is worth trying.",0

"Why does she keep me around? Like I do nothing but eat away at her life and put her through more pain. She means the world to me, she is my best friend and I love her so much. I would do anything for her, but I cannot actually do anything right. She smiles and says I am doing fine, but I know its a lie. I annoy her with my constant whining and downer attitude. I am too clingy but I cannot help it. She cannot bring herself to tell me to fuck off because she knows I cannot deal with it, so she sticks around and puts herself through it. She hates me. I am not stupid, I can see it. Does she talk about me behind my back about how much of a pain I am and how she wishes I was gone? I do not know, I hope not, but I know I have done nothing to have her sing my praises I wish I was gone too, I did not ask to be born in the first place. I want to just disappear and have no one wonder where I have gone. Then again, why would they? Hell, if I could, I would just hit fast forward. Life is just me waiting for whatever random occurance kills me. Unless I grow a set and hit stop instead. Would anyone really care if I did? Would they even bother with a funeral? I am probably worth a ditch in a field somewhere. Cheap, disposable, I serve my purpose and die. that is what my life is. there is nothing good waiting for me, nothing worth hanging on for. Everyone else is doing so much better than me, and they deserve it, I am happy for them. I am the trash, the bottom of the barrel, I deserve nothing. let us face it, all my ""friends"" probably think I am stupid. They can see through my act, I am just a pity case. I am the tag-along, the loner that gets the sad boy treatment. I want to tell them, have them know how I feel properly. I want them to read this. I want them to know that its nothing personal, just sometimes I do not want to live. But they have got more important things to worry about, I am nothing meaningful to them. I feel bad, no disgusting, that all my feelings get pushed onto the shoulders of one woman who really does not need it, and probably does not care. I am ugly, my hair is horrible, my body is skinny and gross, my nose is bent, my eyebrows are too thick and messy, my voice is whiny and pathetic, everything is disgusting. I shower everyday just so people can bear to be around me. If I am not going out, I will sit and fester in my own disgusting smell. I can smile, I can laugh. Hell, I can have weeks where I feel... okay. Not happy, I do not allow myself to do that anymore. If I feel even the smallest glimmer of happiness, I shut it down. I do not want to be happy, I do not deserve it. I am flat, in some state of ""non-mood."" I exist. And for some reason, I woke up that morning. that is all. No matter how badly I plead with myself, my body keeps on going, it just will not stop. I want it to, so fucking bad. Why the hell am I writing this? Just to be some kind of edgelord? it is my birthday this month, 22 years of existing, I am supposed to be excited, but I am not. I do not deserve that. Why would anyone want to celebrate me? I have done nothing meaningful, nothing productive. I am a fucking parasite. I do not want to make it to 30. So I have decided that I will kill myself the day before my 30th. Why bother living any longer? Your body starts to degrade at 27, it is given up trying to fix you. So why? Why bother going on any longer? there is no point, you are just prolonging the inevitable. So I will just exist till then, plenty of time for something to kill me beforehand. Hell, why not kill myself at 25? Make it easier on myself. But I suppose I have to give myself a chance, not that I want to, but self-righteous twats will not let me give up. I bet they enjoy it, making me keep going, making me doubt myself on wether or not I choose to stop living. I just wish I was gone. Fuck my family, fuck my parents for having me, I hate them both. I wish I was just another stillbirth, just like my brother, Matthew. I bet he would be doing great right about now, why did I get to live, but he did not? it is not fair, I would trade places in an instant. Selfish assholes, both of them. I do not want them anymore, I do not want any of my family anymore. Fucking disown me, please, stop pretending I am worth a damn when I am just the failure. that is it.

"My life used to be ok. Friends, university, life was good. It about ended there after I was diagnosed with mental illness, dropped out and proceeded to waste 7 years until now.I never felt the same, people never used to look at me the same.I recently had a child with a woman who I honestly do not have the emotional energy for.Mom died who was like my best friend.I have been contemplating suicide for the past few years every single day. Through all the years the only thing that kept me going was belief in my capabilities, but now I honestly do not feel like I want to live anymore. I have lost the drive that once resided in myself. I have given up on my fantasy of success. There is nothing that I want in this world anymore. I am pretty certain that nothing will ever make me happy again, no matter how big or small. I think I have been completely hollowed out.Perhaps a last ditch effort can be made by running away, living on the street and turning back to substances. Perhaps it shall invigorate something inside of me again, but I honestly cannot see the point of trying. I do not see the point of having to live anymore.Even though I picture killing myself all day, I cannot put those around me though that. I have just been living with this hole inside of me, getting emptier as each year passes.I feel terrible every single day that I have to subject those around me to my sadness. it is hard because I know they try and are there for me trying to pull me out, I just cannot see any possibility of it happening anymore.I am sorry Empty",1

I do care a little, I just am do not feel well enough to structure it. That takes a lot of energy, which I do not have. I used to do martial arts and exercise all the time ( but It did not cure my mental illnesses, it basically worked like medication ) dojo in particular made me feel like I was important to them( which I had never felt before in group settings ), but because of Covid and personal issues I was booted out because I left for 3 months. I keep trying to work out again but always fail, I hate when people say just do it WELL I DO AND I cannot FOLLOW THROUGH.

"I stopped seeing my therapist last march because I really started feelinf better due to the lockdown. No pressure, no nothing. It was like heaven.

I received my RN NCLEX results yesterday. I passed. I am a licensed registered nurse now. I have spent four years working my ass off for this. The problem is that I am fucking tired. I am 22 years old. I have been diagnosed with depression since 15. First time I tried to kill myself I was 12. My anxiety will not stop. The self hatred will not stop. I am engaged to someone who I think hates me half of the time. Someone who does not seem to think I am enough for them. And they are all I have. I am scared to death to actually be a nurse without supervision. I hate my body. I barely eat because of that. My body hurts constantly. My bones ache.

"Wondering about mental health (depression?) Advice/comments welcomed and appreciated.Preface: I know I cannot get an actual diagnosis from this site, but I would really like to get peoples opinions/thoughts on this. I am just going to dump a bunch of information here, and I am sorry if its too long. I am going to treat this like a rant, so it will not be organized.Over the past couple of years, I feel like my mental health has been declining. In 2019, I started spending more and more time alone in my bed, and its continued on to this day. I have been passing it off as laziness (Ibe been a lazy person in general for quite a while), but I think its more than that, because I used to only have short periods of laziness. In other words, I used to have occasional lazy days, but now every day feels like a lazy day. I sit on my bed, watching YouTube, listening to music, daydreaming, and checking my apps. When I am not working (I work part-time), I mostly just do these lazy activities.I also currently have a lack of hobbies- probably related to laziness. I want to pursue hobbies and interests like I used to. I want to spend time doing something I enjoy. But, I just cannot get the motivation to. I feel like I cannot get the motivation to do much, even low-effort activities or tasks. My lack of productivity and hobbies has led me to think very negatively about myself. I feel like I am skill-less, talentless, boring, and useless. Its a vicious cycle: lack of motivation = not productive = more negative thoughts. I have also noticed that I am not excited over things Id normally be. For example, I recently went on a short vacation, but I generally felt bored throughout it, when normally Id be anxious and excited to do things. I felt like I could not get excited. Aside from COVID, nothing huge has happened in my life recently that would typically evoke depression, so its hard to pinpoint where this is coming from, and that is frustrating. I also do not feel too bad (its like a constant meh with occasional dark days), or mentally suffocated, like people with depression have described, so I am not sure. I sorta feel like I am overreacting or being dramatic. But I am also quite concerned.To summarize: I am constantly lazy, I am not productive, I have lots of negative thoughts about myself and my life, and I feel like I am in a constant state of boredom and indifference.

"(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. ""Work on your self esteem"" or ""You sound insecure"". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities",0

I do not know if this is the right subreddit but I am just looking for advice.As i said in the title I am planning to kill myself nothing is going to change my mind but I was wondering what I should write. I guess I am just asking if I should be truthful or not. Should I tell my sister and brother that the jokes they made killed me a little by little should I tell my parents that a big reason of why I killed myself is because of the things they have done. I mean would you want your loved one to be truthful in their suicide note or would you want a generic I love you so much but my demons were bigger. I am going to kill myself by the end of summer break that means in about one and a half months. I was thinking about my suicide note and I do not know what i should write.,1
"I grew up wishing I would been aborted instead of adopted. My adopted mother beat me, sometimes so badly I could not walk. I would pray at night for god to make me never exist but those thoughts and prayers would just get me beaten again. It took me awhile to realize that monster would wait at the door and listen in and then come back in and beat me again because I wanted to not exist.So I stopped saying that audibly but I never stopped thinking it.I met my birth mother about 20 years ago. I met my birth father only about 2 years ago because I was lied to initially about who he was. I get why she lied, she was raped and did not want the family to know if was a friend. She should have aborted me.I thought somewhere along the line of doing life's usual things that I would find it has meaning. So I got married, had kids, got dogs, etc.What I have found is that the desire to have never existed never goes away. Life does not ever seem to have more or less meaning. I never feel more or less. Not even beating cancer when I was 19 did it.To be honest, about the only thing that I ever \*really\* cared about was my wife and family. She told me about 8 years ago she does not love me anymore. I have lost my mom, dad, brother, I have no one left and I cannot get over this anger at my kids that my wife and I had a great relationship before kids and then it ended. It had to be doomed, but it was great while it lasted. 8 years of living knowing your wife does not love you. I am still here for now because I choose to love her even though she does not love me.I stopped taking care of myself about 8 years ago. I am going through life doing the motions that a normal person might do but I am not normal. I should have never existed. In my dislike of living I fear that I am hurting those around me. Not physically. I can just tell. I feel like everyone I know would be better off if I was gone. Maybe they could find happiness if I was not stopping them. Just never should have been here",1

"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them.Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden of having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to falsely hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",1
"A year ago suicide was not even an option, I could never imagine myself even self harming but now, now it is seems like the only option. Everyday I have to put up this persona or a cheerful girl who does not have a care in the world, I laugh, I joke I do everything in my power to make people think I am ok and it is not even for an admirable reason like 'i do not want to burden them' it is because I am a fucking pussy and would probably start crying. I am so fucking lazy I have not brushed my teeth since God knows when, I only showered yesterday because I went out with my friends today and I have been going to sleep at 6am and waking up at 4pm. I am so fucking lazy that sometimes I do not cut myself because I cannot bring myself to get up. On Sunday I am going out with my friends and maybe afterwards I will end it, I might as well make my last memories fun. I do not know why I am sharing this, perhaps a small part of me wants people to tell me that I am worthy or something I also do not know how I would kill myself but I will figure it out I will be leaving soon",1
I bust my ass day in and day out for my wife and kids. Bills never end. Food is always needed. Car repairs are random. Now since she is been put on best rest bc of a high risk pregnancy an is bed ridden I have had to take multiple days off of work. Bc of that I was fired. So guess what that means. More late bills. No food and no repairs. I am sick of this shit. I am trying to progress in life but I cannot bc of shit like this. I am tired of being broke and struggling man. Why is adulting so hard??!,0
I am just so tired of living .it feels like a burden. Having told my partner about me thinking about it and her not caring does help me to realize perhaps it is time to move on. I want to disappear,1
"I just wanted to tell all of you that you are wonderful. I will be okay please do not worry I just need somewhere to vent right now. I am sure Ill be fine in the morning when I wake up but right now its not. I know I should close my eyes and go to sleep but Id rather stay awake and think of everything that is wrong in life, in the world. So here I go, closing my eyes as I cry myself to sleep for just one more night of many to come. I just wish I was not so alone. For me Its worse feeling alone when you know you have people you can talk to. Goodnight you beautiful human beings. I love each and every one of you. I am not okay",1
"I am 20, soon to be 21 and I just cannot handle life. I have been sleeping a lot lately. I go to bed at around 10 pm, wake up at 8 am and then go back to sleep at around 11 am or 12 pm. I then sleep until about 3 to 4 pm, and then the cycle continues. I have barely any money left and I am relying on selling some of my belongings in order to get money for my phone bills and food. I quit my last job due to the fact that I just did not have it in me to continue working in that environment: in an environment in which I felt like I was treated lower than everyone else working there. They did say that I was a good fit for the job, but I have a feeling they were lying, or they did not talk to the manager that oversaw my tasks at work, who I am pretty sure thought I was an idiot.. I am starting to believe him. At one point, it was functioning depression, but its not anymore. I eat poorly because of my depression: I eat way too much food: especially bad food. I went into town yesterday to get my meds, which only took about 2 hours. I came back and I was exhausted. It makes me think how I was even able to keep a job in the first place, if I cannot even go into town to get meds without being tired and fed up with life. The meds in question are anti-psychotics and anti depressants, since I hear voices and have delusions from time to time and have depression. Besides that, I have a hard time being a ""responsible"" adult. I put things off either because I am too scared of the outcome, or I just do not care enough to do it. I have been taking my meds on time and they helped for a while, but they do not help anymore. I just do not have the energy or the care to keep going with this life anymore. Sad part is, is that my life is not even that hard. I cannot handle life",0
"Considering how bad I was during the new year, I am lucky I made it this far, but I think it is time to go. I feel empty rn and when I do not feel empty it is complete agony. I am sick of going day by day thinking it will get better, thinking maybe this will be the day I get help, when I really know that I am never going to get help. Unless something drastic happens, I will never get help. I am not capable of it. I do not do things unless I feel pressure to do them, and even my worst suicidal thoughts I got used to so I do not feel the urgency anymore. Maybe if my professors put ""call the counselling center"" as a graded assignment I would do it. But as of now it is not going to happen. I am going to kill myself one day, so why not tonight. Maybe if I survive I will get the help I need. And if I do not I will not have live with this stupid brain which seems intent on making my life as agonising and exhausting as possible regardless of how good my life is on the outside. Adios",1

"I live with my dad and he does not love me, hes been threatening to kick me out since i was 12. I am still under 18 for a few years so i cannot even move out yet. I told my mom I am angry at her for leaving me with him and for even giving birth to me and she compared me to my dad. my siblings all moved out a long time ago and barely talk to me. Noone ever helps me. I am tired of being told to stick around for a while and it will get better. I am tired.

"A bit of context, I am FtM transgender and in the closet.Over the past few weeks I have been growing more and more depressed and dysphoric, leading up to a break down. As much as Id like to say I am typically stable, this happens every few months, and just like last time, I did it in front of my friend. The two main things that caused this to happen was my realization that I am not happy, I have not been happy in a long time, and that I cannot be happy as a girl. (Part of this hit me when I had a vivid dream where I discovered that I was not a biological female, and everyone just accepted that. I did not need to come out, I did not need to explain or justify myself, I was just genuinely happy.)I texted my friends yesterday saying that I am not going to be active in our group chat because I am close to snapping, and they found this really funny and wanted me to go on a depressed and manic rant (something I have been known to do very well when I am like this). This pissed me off because its clear that they do not actually care about my well-being, and that they just want me to say something funny. Because I was so isolated and left alone with my thoughts, I started harming myself. I was clean for months but the stress of everything made me relapse. Shortly after this I texted my best friend telling him everything that happened and how alone I am. Hes cisgender and is not depressed, so he does not understand what I am feeling, but hes always there for me. I was crying while texting him, telling him everything I did and everything I was feeling. He did not know how to react, and it was clear that he was just concerned, but he just stayed with me. He said that he did not know how to help, and I said that just being here and making sure I am not alone is helping a lot. I told him that I was afraid of going to sleep, because I cannot handle having another dream where I am happy just to be met with my miserable reality. He stayed up with me until 1:30, when he told me I need to sleep and that he will not let me destroy myself by staying awake all night like I wanted.It took an hour for me to fall asleep after that, the entire time all I wanted do was harm myself again, it was the only thought going through my mind and its still the only thought in my head. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my best friend being happy to hear that I stopped, so I have not done it for him. I broke down in front of my friend (tw self harm)",0
"I remember being 13. Constant morning wood. Full erections. Could masturbate whenever I wanted. Over the next few years I noticed that my erections became weaker and that I could not ejaculate as easily. Got my first girlfriend at 16 and I realized something was wrong as I could not get it up. could not ejaculate. Nothing. We broke up a few weeks later. She told all her friends that I was gay. was not nice. Other than a few wet dreams, I have not orgasmed since I was 15, nor have I had an erection.I am now 31, and over the last 16 years I have tried everything. Endocrinologists, neurologists, urologists, cardiologists, everything. I have had every blood test and everything is normal. Something went seriously wrong during my pubertal development. No one knows what. I have tried every pill, every cream, every urethral tablet, every penis injection, every pump, every ultrasound therapy, and every band. I have taken anabolic steroids, serms, sarms, and dopamine drugs. No change. The last resort was a penile implant which became infected and had to be taken out. The doctors are unwilling to try another one given the likelihood of infection. It does not matter anyway, as my penis was still numb. So now I am left with a shattered, fibrotic penis. I cannot even pee standing up because my pee hole was ruined.So here I am. A 31 year old who by some definitions is still a virgin. I had a second girlfriend at 25, and the only sex we had was oral for her benefit. That lasted 6 months then she left me. She said were not compatible, but the only arguments we had related to my inability to have sex, so I think it was that. I am pretty sure she was cheating on me. I did not really enjoy the relationship anyway, as I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen, and it was very frustrating to not be able to have sex with her. All I wanted to do was hold her down and fuck her silly every second of the day. I could not fall asleep next to her because I could not stop thinking about all the ways I wanted to fuck with her. It was a huge tease and I was honestly relieved when she left me.I am going to kill myself. I will not say how or when, because that will get this post removed. If you think its stupid to commit suicide over a penis that might as well not exist, try this. do not masturbate, have sex, or orgasm for 6 months. do not touch your penis at all. See how horny you get, and how every thought in your head is related to how much you just want to have sex. Then realize that you will never be loved by a woman, and even if you were you would wish you was not because she would just further add to your unquenched libido. Live every moment wanting something you cannot have, and hating yourself for being unable to have it. Sex does not seem like much until you cannot have it, just like water does not seem like much until you cannot have it. I have never and will never be able to have sex with a woman and fall asleep with her in my arms. That thought alone is enough to make me kill myself. This is mental torture. I have tried everything to fix my penis, including some treatments not even officially indicated for erectile dysfunction and genital anaesthesia. I have given it my all to fix my life, and now there is nothing left to try. Its hopeless. I hate my life. I have sacrificed everything I can in the vein hope of being able to have sex, and to have a normal relationship. Or at the very least being able to have a fucking wank so I can relieve some tension.I am very proud of myself for sticking it out this long. I think anyone else in my position would end it before their 20s. But this has to end. I am truly unhappy. I was born 100 years too early. No doubt they will be able to diagnose and fix what was wrong with me in 2100, but by that time Ill be dead anyway.If there is any silver lining here, its that an elevated libido makes men aggressive, and aggression makes the act of committing suicide easy. I am done. Goodbye and good riddance to my shitty life. Not going to bother with a suicide note. Hope you all manage to fix your problems. I am unable to have sex. I am ending it here",1
I been gone for a while but life is back up to its bull shit I am so tired of being alive the curse of life continues I am back,1

I do not even have a good reason for it I just do not enjoy life. My mental health just keeps getting worse and I just want to stop feeling like shit all the time. I want to die,1
"Not sure if I am allowed to share the link here but it is called 'How to recover from depression' on youtube. It contains a very thorough and well-reasoned perspective on depression, its multitude of causal factors, the effects, the need for a unique treatment plan (not just meds / talking / exercise) that is based on the causes of your individual depression. it is made me feel slightly more in control, slightly less prone to believing my negative thought castles, and slightly more hopeful. Overall I feel significantly less depressed right now, after over a week of full on black dog mode. Highly recommend giving it a look. Watched a video that lifted me up for the first time in days",0
"I just lost my job, no one in my family suppports me or know what are things i like and enjoy to do. I try to start getting back onto something but their insults or smirks or scoffs are just too much. Things i got used to ignore but already piled up.I cannot do something for my mom or my dad. My mom wants me to be this person i do not want to be and just looks sad or disappointed or just trying to hold her temper whenever she is interacting with me or whenever i avoid the conversation when she starts to insist what she wants again. I am living with my brother and his family but got to live with this atmosphere where they are itching to throw me out. I have been in a series of interviews for the past 2 months but cannot get in a goddam job. I do not eat and go out of my room that much to avoid whatever i am doing wrong in their eyes. I feel trapped. I was alone in the house earlier and i sat at the bathroom. the shower hose is made out of soft plastic, long enough. the height of the window is high enough. I sat there thinking how would i look, how long will it take till they find out? whose going to see me first? Can they tell that since i got here i have been suicidal? That they have been interacting with someone like me? That it would be too late when they finally piece it together? That when i finally went out for a hike, they did not see anything but a dangerous and reckless waste of time. No one even ask a picture or asked how was it. Fuck. And now i am spiraling to this feeling of nothingness, of emptiness and that thought that the only rational thing to do is just end it, because there is nothing really different in me being here, feeling nothing to being not here, feeling nothing. What i really want is actually simple, that someone would genuinely care. I am way deep in the rabbit hole that validation seems inappropriate anymore or any sign of response is pity or i tend to negate anything or mistrust anything because they will trap me. I just want to be left alone nowadays and i do not know what i am really here. This sounds like a rant, I am sorry to whoever got as far as here. The only thing that stopped me is the thought that i cannot let these people live in the guilt of thinking it is their fault even if it is all mine.

My own father does not even want me. I am mean and terrible to people. I push them all away and most of the time they leave me. It shows me how unworthy I am. I just want to sleep and never wake up.

"I wake up every morning wanting to die. Its the first thought I have. Recently, I have been fixated on a gunshot to the temple, but sometimes its a noose, other times I imagine jumping from the thousandth floor of a Trump tower. These thoughts and urges are obsessive, intrusive and uncontrollable. While mornings are the worst, I have to contend with these thoughts throughout the day everyday. I have to actively fight them on a near constant basis. Sometimes physically. I have stopped myself an inch short of plunging a kitchen knife into my abdomen. I have almost thrown myself onto the Trans Canada highway and I came pretty close to jumping off a few bridges. I have attempted suicide several times and have been hospitalized over ten times. I do not think about the future much, but when I do, I catastrophize. I worry about homelessness, car accidents and cancer. Living in survival mode makes it difficult to have dreams or goals. I am living day to day, hour by hour, just trying to hang on. I am grumpy, bitter and short tempered. I can scroll Facebook for hours upon hours because it dulls the pain. I sometimes watch CNN all day to cope because its absolutely mind numbing. I isolate and its hard to leave the house. I barely sleep and have difficulty feeding myself. And this is all when I am not depressed. I am usually depressed about half the year. But my suicidality is not limited to my depressive episodes. Suicide hijacks my brain regardless of mood or emotional state. When I am depressed, thoughts of suicide are a response to deep hopelessness. Suicide seems like the only way to end the endless suffering. When I am not clinically depressed, I am still suicidal. These thoughts and urges are intrusive and impulsive. They both come out of nowhere and replace all shades of negative emotion. Instead of feeling irritated, I become suicidal. Annoyed? Suicide. Disappointed? Death. There is no middle ground. Its all or nothing. Black or white. Live or die. This has been my life for the better part of a decade. there is not much help for people like me. Antidepressants do not work. Nor do most other types of medication. And the hospital makes me feel worse. There is a lack of empirical data to suggest that hospitalization reduces suicide risk and it may actually increase the risk over the long term. Besides, the best advice emergency room doctors can give is to distract myself with activities that I enjoy. The only problem is that I have not enjoyed an activity in years. Or they suggest calling a friend. I ran out of those years ago. The only real treatment for a person like me is dialectical behavioural therapy: an expensive, involved and complex treatment that can take years to complete and master. I have dropped out of three such programs which is another matter altogether. DBT teaches you to manage inevitable suicidal thinking. When you have borderline personality disorder suicidal ideation is just something you may have to learn to live with. It is important to note that not everyone with BPD experiences chronic suicidality. However, 10% of BPD sufferers will die by suicide. Most people who complete DBT will learn to manage these thoughts and eventually get better. I am starting DBT again this week. Things will be different this time. I am ok. Read to the end. I am ok.",1
"Talk me out of this sentiment and give me your logic- be brutal. I think Id be so ideal and such a good because of death than an apparent suicide. But that is assuming Id get sick enough and deteriorate , otherwise $hit- I guess Id just add physical pain to distract from the emotional one. here is my concern: Are unvaccinated people only a risk to themselves ( excluding being around those who are unable to get the vaccine abroad young kids) or is this a false claim? Do I pose a risk to others? I would just not travel maskless or in large groups but what are your thoughts on this. If there is a chance that an unvaccinated person can die, Id like to take my chances BUT",1

"maybe I am just not made for life. people abandon me. i have no best friends. i used to. my day is basically to wake up, eat, be on my pc only watching youtube videos, eat, go do whatever i need to, eat again rinse and repeat. then i see people having fun, having relationships and just enjoying life. and yet here i am. frequenting pubs, drinking alone until i can barely stand...i thought maybe i can quit my bad habits once i got with my gf. i trusted her with my life. now she does not even want to talk to me anymore. then again, I am responsible for her not wanting to talk to me. i fuck up every relationship or i ghost people. yet everyone says to me that i have a life ahead of me, I am 17, i got a whole life ahead of me...what is the point? what is the point of going to college, having a job, coming to an empty house, drinking until you cannot stand and going to work the next morning. if i talk to my parents, they belittle me or mock me. what happens after death anyways? sometimes i want to take the risk, hoping it would end my suffering but it does not. maybe my fate is sealed anyways.

I am going through a nasty breakup, i really loved her but she did not feel the same way sadly. my friends do not talk to me anymore, I am just a burden to them.

"Anything positive will do! I am very tempted to just give up. Ironically the trigger was posting on Reddit; but I have nowhere else. I have all I need to die. I was planning on it but I managed to get myself out of it, but again I have ended up back here. Probably my own fault, though was not helped by how negative most spaces online are. I want to die because there is no point. I have wanted to die for years, I have attempted plenty of times. I finally found a reason to live recently in that I am trans. That realisation gave me hope, but that is long faded. Its years on waiting lists, its the stress of fighting my corner all the time. Constant abuse online. No one in my life understands. I wake up and I see a man. An ugly pathetic man. It does not feel like me, and I have to go through the day colleagues, and strangers seeing me as a man. Dead naming me. All because nobody understands. The constant hate in the media, on social media, even at my university! Then I think is it even worth it? What if I do not pass, what if being a women is not enough? what is the gain from continuing to live? The only reason I am reaching out is i made the mistake of convincing myself I could cope. I wish Id never done that, wish Id given up long ago. I have written this in a rush at work, sorry if it makes no sense. I am used to people ignoring me.I know I am not worth the time. I have been told I am selfish and attention seeking. So that is probably all this is. Need help! Plan to die tonight.",1
Every time I mention that I want to kill myself or that I want to die to people that are close to me I am always met with the there are better days ahead! Think of all the things you have not experienced. I do not know but a part of me just does not care. Like yeah there are beautiful places to explore and countries I have not yet been to butat the end of the daytheyre just countries? they are just places? they are justexperiences? I do not know how to explain it. Its just I do not care anymore. The only thing that is holding me back is my family. And maybe that makes me care but I just do not care about myself. I have not cared about myself for so long and it makes me not care about dying or anything that happens in my life. I just do not want to live. I wish I never existed. there is nothing I want to live for,1
"I get this constant nagging feeling that I am just born wrong, or something about myself makes me the least interesting person to exist. I feel invisible. I feel lost. I feel unmotivated. I feel extremely lonely with no one to express or confide in. Despite how creative I try to be or how much I try to learn, I keep failing and keep getting increasingly brain-dead. Despite how thankful I try to be with what I have in life, I do not feel happy, fulfilled, or satisfied. My goals and purpose are dissolving. I feel unnoticed and unguided. I constantly imagine myself being shunned when I reach out. I feel detached, and completely helpless. I wanted to grow and always stand apart from those around me. I have always wanted to become the most interesting person in a room. I thrive on social life and love people and try to be my best version amongst people. I try to look my best without forcing myself to be conventional. I try my best, yet I get miserably opposite results. I try my best, yet am able to attract nothing. I feel extremely lonely and un-purposeful. I do not want to live, I am tired of it all. I feel like shit, with no one to talk to. I feel like giving up.",0

"I had a girlfriend until yesterday. I would wanted to start casual, but she made me fall in love with her so quickly. She moved me into her home when I was at my worst, pulling me out of my abusive mother's home and promising to help me. Telling me that even if we did not work out, I could still stay with her. Knowing I was terrified she would leave me because everyone always abandons meFirst thing in the morning yesterday, less than a week after I moved in, she told me we were breaking up and I had to move out. I vomited from stress in her driveway as I packed the car but as with everything in my life I was alone. I will always be alone. I thought if I could just hold on until tomorrow, I would be okay. Just distract myself. But its tomorrow and it is not enough. I wish she would fucking killed me instead, rather than have someone I barely know leave me on my horrible mother's doorstep. Every fucking second all I could think is I would rather fucking die than keep living with this pain. Knowing I am never good enough and I never will be.

Why did I have to be born into an abusive household. I am done pretending I have had a great childhood my father was a prick shit fuck and left me with issues that caused me to never have friends and he gets away with it. He left the fucking country so he does not need to pay child support so we everyday struggle for money. And when i feel like everything is going well i get reminded that we had touched me a little boy whenever my mum was out and my sister never helped. What the fuck did i do wrong? I try being there for others but because of how I behaved in school people hated me. I just wanted to be noticed or to have some little power in my life for once. I ended up leaving school too early and was dumped by the education system as they did not want to help.Not that anything matters now i just need to vent typing this out helps in a bizarre unusual way. I am too worried to go to therapy. I was under cahms when i was younger and all they did was worsened things and betrayed me so therapy is possibly worse. I do not want to be diagnosed with anything i just want to believe I am normal?. I had a girlfriend for a year believe it or not i still wonder how. does not matter she used me and cheated on me because again i must deserve this for no particular reason. I am done venting now sorry for that. Why me?,0
"I do not use reddit at all but I just wanted to share what I am going through and hopefully someone can take time to read this and reply because I do need some type of support from another person. I am 19 and I have always had underlying issues like anxiety or this impending sadness that I have always pushed to the side growing up as a teen because my parents have never even talked about mental health. I even was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but my mom has a huge stigma on mental health and told the doctors I am just a kid. I thought it was normal that growing up I would get extremely nervous before doing anything/simple tasks. I also would get distracted so easily and was never able to sit down and do work at school/home. My mom was also emotionally abusive at times and would rarely hit me but when she did its over things that she should not be putting her hands on me for. Thinking about it high school was a dark time for me but at the time I did not feel that bad about it until it caught up to me after i graduated. My mom is a great mother but she has never listened to my opinion and has always kept me in a box. She was a helicopter mom checking what I do all the time and this led me to have little to no social life in high school. Also my highschool was so sick and twisted I could go into a whole other post about it. I kept telling my mom to take me out of that school but of course she never listened and forced me to go to a school with only about 200-300 students. The students all acted way younger than there age. The seniors would act like 6th graders and it was just such a weird and confusing environment. I am very angry at my mom but I do love her immensely so When I turned 18 that is when a lot of my issues caught up with me. I was unhappy and unable to even speak to people. My anxiety became worse when i would start shaking before even speaking to somebody. I started to notice that the friends and the people i knew at the time are not what I am looking for in friends. I do not know if that is my depression making me think all my friends are not people i want to be around but regardelsss i pushed everyone away. While going through such a horrible phase my 18 year was hell. My mom thought i was changing and being cold when in reality i was just really really down. She made me feel bad for the way i was feeling and still does till this day. I had no social life or any friends because i pushed everyone away. One positive about my 18 year is i finally found my passion but i wish i discovered myself earlier. I also have zero idea how to start. Now I am 19 and my anxiety and depression have become debilitating. I quit my job and I am in my room all the time with no contact with ppl besides my online friends (i was in my room all the time in high school too). I have now become distant to my family and i feel so distant from everybody. I have daily intrusive and very sad thoughts 24/7. I am already getting therapy but i feel so bad at times. I right now cannot imagine myself having a job or going to college. It almost seems impossible to me. I Also judge people so much and think that I am above others in my head but i truly know its because I am unhappy with myself. my mom is extremely judgmental too so its hard for me to do things i like without her judging me. I just need someone to talk to, Ill try to reply but i might forget i even wrote this post or be too nervous to reply. I need advice about my my mental health,social life, what I am interested in, and about my old friends in which i pushed away out of both my own choice and my mental health. I do not know where to get started. Just need to speak about what I am going through (Long post)",0

"I have my first new therapy sesh in a half hour and I am hoping it helps. I moved back home to my parents basement last summer after going thru severe depression from my first ever relationship ending. i feel really guilty because i said and did horrible things to make my ex feel the pain i was feeling and lost the great friendship we had because i wanted so badly to keep him interested in me- just to make myself feel like i was worth something. or to distract from how meaningless my life has always felt. I am a gay almost 25 year old from a big city and i had a good network of people in high school who still live here but they are all straight and i do not relate to them much. were not close. before moving back home i lived in my college town (another big city). most of my friends there were straight too and i felt different but i had closer relationships with them. since high school I have been deeply depressed and dissociated from my life so much i just showed up got the grades and graduated. no college professors to write letters of rec for grad school. credit score sucks. stuck in a dead end job here that i do a terrible job at because it feels pointless. it requires me to go into areas of the city that have shootings every day so I am always on edge that ill get shot or carjacked. it also sucks being the only gay person in a straight male dominated space. I have switched jobs every six months or so since finishing college 3 years ago so my resume looks too bad to get a cool new job. but i also feel like working in this strange capitalistic society is a waste of my time here on earth. i feel that there is so much i could accomplish but i have no avenues to achieving them. i now have an expensive ass car note so cannot quit my job. i am afraid ill never be successful, have my own place, live a life I am happy with, fulfill any purpose. i fight suicidal thoughts daily. i feel so alone and hopeless and idk where to go from here.

"When I was 15 years old I 21 year old man from my church. He was one of the youth group volunteers and therefore, I did not find it odd when he started reaching out to me online. It seemed he was worried about me as an adult and I thought he was trying to sort of guide me into the right path. He would constantly tell me how smart and how beautiful I was. When I was 16 he and I started messaging every day. He would ask about school and ask about my parents. I would complain to him about my parents and instead of giving real advice, he would feed into it. ""Yeah, they do not understand you"" while making it clear that HE understood me. He made me feel so important and so special. By the time I turned 17 and he was 24, we were in CONSTANT contact. We would message all day while I was at school and then when I got home. I did not do homework and I stayed up til 3 on some nights just chatting with him. When I got my license he began making sexual advances. At first I tried to keep him away but I wanted to be wanted so badly. He told me that we were supposed to be together. He told me he loved me and he told me I was perfect. He would have me tell my parents I was sleeping at a friends house but I would be sleeping at his house instead. One time he convinced me to try alcohol, telling me ""It will taste like candy"". When I did not like it, he tried to get me to drink the whole things but I would not. He was genuinely obsessed with me. He admitted that he was keeping boys my age away from me whenever he could when I was 15 and 16 years old. He told me that he was always looking at my social media, including what I watched and commented on Youtube. There were a couple times I tried to break things off with him but he just would not let go. This went on and off for 6 years until it finally ended for real. I was 23....and I realized that I was around his age when he started things physically with me as a Jr. in high school. I pictured myself with a high school Jr. of 17 years old and I felt sick to my stomach. It messed me up really badly. I did not know what a healthy relationship was. I never really progressed emotionally the way I was supposed to; like I was constantly just stuck at 17 years old. I wanted him in jail. He BELONGS in jail....only he does not. 34 states the age of consent is 16, including my own. It is LEGAL for an adult of ANY age to have sex with a 16 year old high school SOPHOMOR! In most states, you can even have sex with an actual child...as long as you get married. Guess what? it is LEGAL to marry a child in those same states, as long as you get parental consent; WHICH PARENTS GIVE ALL THE TIME. This is literally happening in the United States and it is just fine with everyone. I am messed up forever, going to trauma therapy, and our government is telling me that nothing bad happened to me. Because at that age I was considered to be equipped to handle a grown man, feeding me alcohol, telling me he was in love with me and promising me that he was going to solve all my problems. The same age girls were all obsessed with Twilight and learning how to drive. I was not old enough to buy cigarettes, or alcohol, or voted....but I could have sex with adults. do not get me wrong; I do not think I SHOULD have been allowed to buy cigarettes or alcohol or vote....but HE should not have been allowed to do the things he did to me. I feel like I am going to vomit. I hate this world. I just want this world to change",0

"My parents divorced when I was like 5, and I would have visitation with my dad. He would always take me around with girls he met off Facebook to try impress them and by chance their own children (if they had any). On weekends that he would not drag me out with him to meet the women he would talk to he would take me to the park or something, but he would never actually play with me. He would stay in the car chatting with women, I would practically have to beg him to come play with me only to be ignored. he would often even prioritize the womens children over me in order to gain their favor, its so hard watching your own parent treating someone elses child the way they should be treating you. he would always make empty promises, like coming to my 6th grade promotion, or my 8th grade graduation, or any important event in my life. I have gotten to the point where I have accepted that he will not even be attending my high school graduation (currently a junior). His emotional and mental abuse has stuck with me and affects so many parts of my life that it is so miserable. Its extremely difficult for me to keep close friends especially one that I guess could be considered a favorite person. Because my brain will twist the slightest hint of drifting apart into oh they are replacing you they are leaving you because of how I perceive if my dad can leave anyone can. I recently had an episode with my best friend where I felt as if I was being replaced and went into a self destructive state where I SH and ghosted them because I did not want to get hurt but ended up hurting them. My brain can twist things and make me overthink the smallest thing because of insecurity of being alone due to multiple instances of my father leaving me alone to go see his girlfriends or whatever. It makes everyday so difficult and I just want to be able to not be so afraid of being alone and or replaced. Dealing with emotional abuse from childhood",0

"So my parents have this thing where they will take a long time to let minor wrongdoings go. They hold all my small inconveniences over my head and it makes me feel awful. For example, they started yelling at me for being ""ungrateful about the help they give me"" which is completely untrue by the way, and when I started to fight back, because I am done with just sitting down and taking it, they hold it over my head for at least the rest of the day. It makes me feel like nothing I do is good enough for them. How do I deal with this? Whenever I try to talk to them about anything wrong that they do, they always get angry about it. What do I do?

"Normally I can keep my time and my mind occupied so I do not think about it but sometimes I observe something that triggers feelings of sadness and hopelessness. It usually involves seeing other people move up in life. I, on the other hand, have not found any success. To success in career, finances, skills and hobbies, nothing. Its just wake up, go to my soul crushing job, go to sleep, repeat. Its not as if I have not tried to pursue success in different areas of life. I have and continue to do so but I have only failed. Those of who are a bit older know what I mean when I say, at some point you have to come to terms with your own limitations. Not everyone will succeed in this life.

Anything?Do you have some easy workout routines?I will give anything a try. How do you cope?,0
"When I wake up there is this tiny moment where I realize what my life has became and who I became and I ask myself what have I done? How did it get this bad? Why me? I have tried so hard but nothing seems to work. I came to conclusion that I am just a hopeless case and this is my destiny. I do not want to be anything to be honest. Because I would not even know how to live a life that is bearable, I really do not. Tomorrow is my birthday I am turning 19. I know that is young but I feel like I have lived here forever. I went through so much and experienced a lot I am an old soul and do not want to do this anymore Lost in life",1
"When I was a ""gifted"" child, I was promised the future. The future is a load of shit. A father I never met but resent nonetheless, a mother who inadvertently destroys every path I lay out for myself, an autistic brother who has essentially become my child to raise in my mother's place, and a world of financial, physical, and psychological burdens dropped on my shoulders due to actions on others' behalves when I was still playing with Polly Pocket. At the age of 22 I juggle between my body cracking and aching every morning I wake up, a head is riddled with gray hairs, the money I make not being mine to spend, the college education I have been working on being extended from 4 to 5 years worth of debt due to my family, and serving as the acting mother of a 48 year old woman and a 14 year old impaired child. I only had three friends I truly cared for, but even their names and any records I had of them were lost to time. I kept living so my family will not have to mourn me, but I no longer have any reason to care about their feelings as they have failed to care for mine. The only thing I cannot leave behind is my cat. I adopted her in the midst of a depressive spell 3 years ago, and she is the only one that is been a source of comfort at every time I needed her. She certainly does not understand how crucial a role she played in maintaining my sanity, but to pay her back I want to ensure she lives a long, happy life. She is expected to die in 8 years, at which point I will be 30, my student debt, medical, and living expenses--as well as my family's--will control my wallet, and my body will be further worse than wear for the age. Whatever happens in these 8 years, I do not care. Love, success, joy--it is worthless striving for them when all my life I have pushed beyond my limits to achieve them only to fall flat at every turn. All I want is to repay my debt to a sweet calico with white paws and a kind of ugly looking face, and end the fucking misery I will have on my back once I am done. I Die When My Cat Dies",1
"Recently I have been opening up about how I felt on different places and many people have told me I could possibly have depression/dysthymia and that it would be great for me to go to therapy.But I hesitate. I feel very hopeless. I do not know if therapy could actually help me. How is it like? Are therapists really able to understand?I would be very interested in your experiences with therapy while dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts in particular. In all honesty, has therapy helped you in any way with depression/dysthymia and/or suicidal thoughts?",1
"I am shaking and only have bad thoughts on my mind. I am married and my wife and I had kind of a fight tonight it was not really big or anything but I am still overthinking about it. Lately I have been thinking a lot that she would be way better with anyone else and that I do not do nothing good for her.I am a man that is always mad, and that cannot be relaxed and does not like surprises. I cannot be a go happy about life person and she does not need this kind of person around her. She is this kind heart and I am just this dark void.Just thinking about ways of finishing my life right now is relaxing, and that scares me a lot. Help me please",0

"I have been going through a really stressful and emotionally demanding time period in my life and in my relationship for the past few months. I have had a few panic attacks and lots of worry, stress, fatigue, etc associated with my relationship. Including the stress of being with someone who might also have mental illness, constantly worried if they are okay, scared they will hurt themselves, long distance, fighting, etc. A few days ago i all of a sudden feel numb. Like a switch turned and i feel completely disconnected from reality. Totally depressed, sleeping all day, and what is most concerning is that i have no desire to contact my significant other or anybody around me. I think i have been depressed for a long time (~8 years) but only now am i really concerned as I am now so indifferent and numb so suddenly that its hard to do anything. Had anybody experienced this? Maybe my body was overloaded with stress and i was not dealing properly or something and now its sort of shut down on me?It has not been a substantial amount of time, but this is nothing I have felt before. If this is my untreated depression saying hi I have never met it to this degree before. Anyone relate? All of a sudden i feel nothing",0
"I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming. Fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering",0
just a check in post. I am curious to see how you all are doing how are you?,0
"My relationship was the only thing I had going for me and turns out my girlfriend is an extremely dangerous and manipulative person who can &amp; will turn any fight into me being crazy because well I am crazy. Now any emotion I feel is crazy. I quit my job because everyday I was thinking about killing myself. I have been getting really really close to taking my life, there are times I will probably never tell anyone because it hurts to much to process the pain of how close I have come to taking my own life. I want to die so fucking bad. I am tooo fucking innocent and pure for how dirty this world had done me. For the people who have hurt me. I want to fucking die. I need to fucking die. I am worthlesssssssssssssssssssss fucking killl me what is the point",1
"This my SECOND attempt in a month and failed again.Same as the last time. Nausea, vomiting, shaking, then pass out. I do not have the balls to do it even though I know it is much better to do it instead of living.I told my friends about one of my biggest secrets so hopefully I do it this time. But here I am, nothing but a pussy and a failure.My biggest wish is someone killing me, or dying in my sleep somehow.90% of my day is just staring at the ceiling, exhausted mentally and physically.Even when I try to sleep I have some nightmares. Either flashback to my attempt, or me and people I love dying.When will this end. I do not know if I will ever do it and finish it all.I am sorry to admit, but I feel jealous and proud at the same time of people committing suicide. I think they are one of the bravest people out there. I cannot. I just cannot do it",1
So comforting and peaceful... I love that if my life ever becomes even more unbearable than it is now that i can just end ut with a fail-proof method,1
Why is not this a thing? I just want to take a pill to die,1
"it is been four days now with the same routine. Stay in bed, drink tons of coffee, walk around the house talking to myself and having imaginary conversations with people, browse Reddit and 4chan for hours and go back to bed. I am broke, I cannot keep a job and I do not even want to look for one. I start projects and I quit them after a couple weeks. Been on antidepressants for a year now. I feel like a furniture. My whole family is talking about me. Every time I see a possible way of getting busy on something, 32 yo, jobless, at my worst.",0
"&gt;!tw: suicide, self-harm!&lt;I am not even going to bother using a throw-away because I am very not okay right now. I feel like nothing I do in life has been or ever will be enough for anyone. I did not take my medication today (Effexor XR) and it is obviously fucking with me really bad. I need someone to validate me and make me feel cared about before I do something really stupid. I feel like I live just to please because I cannot bare to be by myself. I find being alone with myself agonizingly lonely and I cannot handle it. I am so exhausted every day just living with my parents at 22, no real dreams, nothing. I am always being abandoned and let down by the people I care about and I just cannot handle it anymore. I am so so sad. I think I am giving up",0
I look in the mirror and I look the same but I am a whole different person and I hate that person I hate who I have become,1
"somehow were all mentally ill and traumatized by existence, and the only people who manage to survive are heavily drugged or willingly brainwashed by dogma.. life is so beautiful! i do not understand how this world is safe for us",1
"the only thing that hurts worse than being alive is imagining the pain me dying would put a couple of people i care about through. i cannot imagine a future for myself anymore and i just want to disappear and have everyone forget me so i can die without any guilt. i cannot talk to anyone i know because they all care too much and will try to get me help, and i just want to waste away. the only reason i will not do it is because of my brother and my dog",1
"I am not scared of death, I want it, but I want it to happen like a car crash, hit by a bus, building falling on me. A way that does not i valve me doing it to myself... but lately, driving to and from work, all I can picture is flooring it into any tree, pole, body of water that I see. I entertain the thought every day now. I have not been this bad since I was in middle/high school. All my life I have been winging it because I did not think I would live this long. I wish I did not live this long, I cannot imagine living any longer. Its so hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of living a full life. Day after day. Heartbreak, illness, tragedy, natural disasters, wars. With the exception of a few good moment far in between. I cannot understand how that is worth it to anyone, but I guess I am not like anyone. Never have been. I am too self-aware to live in this world with the thoughts and abilities of observation that I have. I know when people do not like me, I know when I am being annoying, I know I am not pleasing to the eyes and hearts of those around me. They will not verbally say it, but I can read their body language. I can read through the tone of voice or messages. I can tell when everyone who I ever cared about has done me wrong. Especially lately. I cannot blame them. I do not like me either, I do not like how I look, sound, or act. I do not have a personality of my own. I merge. I blend. Or I just occupy a space. I can provide acts of service and endearment, but I am rarely able to connect. Or they cannot seem to connect with me. I used to be funnier, but in an immature freshman kind of humor that is not appropriate today. Now, I do not know anything it seem My brain cannot consume, resonate, or learn new information. It does not stick. Its not advanced like everyone else. I hate to ask questions because no matter what, I will not retain it. I am defective. My self imagine is lower than the floor, its in hell. Growing up being told I will one day blossom like a flower or go from being an ugly ducklong to a beautiful swan was hopeful.. but that day never came. I can make a list as long as a CVS receipt on all the things I hate about my appearance alone. Looking in the mirror is exhausting. Recently had a great friend do a photoshoot of me, I felt confident in the moment, but as soon as I saw the pictures... I loathed myself even more. she is a brilliant photographer with skills. I wish I could have enjoyed them as much as she did. My motivation of anything disappeared a long time ago. I used to draw, fish, play games, hang out with old friends all the time. have not been able to enjoy anything outside of mindless phone games. The friends i used to have, who I thought were my friends... all moved away. I should not be sad about it. They moved a long time ago and they were not nice to me behind my back, but that was when I had the most joy. We were inseparable, going on adventures... then after they moved, I reconnected with another friend who I thought was different.. turned out to be same. I have realized that I have always been the ugly weird friend people drag along to uplift their image and status. Those who I do or did connect with, they are excelling, moving forward with their own lives. I cannot relate to them because I am way back in the line. I do not want to block their way. New relationships, kids, work. I am so happy for them and wholeheartedly wish them the best. For my own relationships... 2 serious ones. First one was a dream come true. Everything I could ask for until it was not. I was at a point where I was moving forward and they were too, but in a very different sense.. I wish them the best and I wish I could take back some words. Now in my current one... if I even could say its currently happening.. 5 years. 5 years of what seemed to be my forever... until it was not, it might still be, but any outside perspective would tell me to run. We managed to get our first apartment, taught me how to drive, got a cat.. all the great milestones. Until it they decided it was not what they wanted anymore by communicating with their ex again. Since then, its been back and forth. My fault, continues to be my fault for staying. I do not even care anymore because I love them. I do not want anyone else. I also know when they leave for good... that will be the end times for me. One of the last threads that has been keeping here. it is fucked up, but that is my reality. Though, it brings me back to wanting it to end in a freak accident rather than myself because I do not want that burden on my parents. That was, still is another waiting period, if all else fails, I will wait until they pass. All I really know, is that I was not made to be here. I have no purpose in this world if all I do is sit and suffer. Repeatedly get hurt, especially on purpose. No personality that could allow new interactions, even then, I already know what the outcome of those would be. Its a cycle of non stop reminders that I have no worth, no value, no point in existing. I would much rather be in eternal slumber than existing agony. What is the point for me",1
"I can try my best, but my best is never good enough for them. I understand that you should always push people to be better, but there are no perfect human beings, and with my mental disorders I will never be what they are looking for. I want to die every single day. Suicide is inevitable. I will never be good enough for my family",1
"Every day I think ""I should kill myself"" and every day I am right. I am miserable all day every day. It is exhausting, I am so fucking tired of living a life I do not even want to live. Everyone I care about is dead, all I have is the festering feeling in my chest where there was once love and caring. I once wanted to fix this world, now I just want it to burn. Why do I continue this bullshit? Unrealistic hope that one day it gets better? The more realistic hope I will become worse of a person that can replace love with the catharsis after a rampage? Too bad no one knows me enough to know what goes through my head in a given day. Maybe someone would appreciate my fortitude, it is not easy to stay alive, but there is a .38 here that would make it real easy to be dead. Just another generic rant.",0
"I am 42 and too many problems to even go on about. I am too tired to talk about it. I am done with my life here, but I do not want my 21 yo son to find my body. I attempted last month. I woke up unable to breathe and it was scary, so I have found another way to go out. I just need to purchase the stuff I need. No one gives a f",1

"I do not truly know my own sexuality. Whenever I am in a relationship, it always feels wrong. I push people away because I do not want to hurt them when I figure out that I am not going to be interested in them. It feels like it is just me and that I am just not destined to be with someone.Is it just me? I have been diagnosed with depression and mild autism, and I have heard that is a common thread, but it feels like it is just me. I do not even know if it is worth living a life where I am deluding myself that I will find someone. I tell everyone in this sub that they will find someone, because that is what I tell myself. I do not even know if that is true anymore. Forever alone",0
"Did you see the movie back to the future? I am like George McFly. I am so depressed and I wish to die. no suicide. I just hope that something kills me cuz I am tired of my life. I suffered with bullying at school because of my appearance and personality. never been the most loved even in my family I am the older brother and the only ugly I feel like they treat me differently (and no not adopted) my father expected a stronger son I love my family but they love my brothers more I never felt bad about this. just everything makes me think I am a loser. My first girlfriend she used me for everything you can imagine. homework studies troubles in general. I did everything for her like a dog but when we graduated she decided to break up with me she said you re veeery boring. she left me crying alone in a restaurant everyone was looking at me and the waiter was more worried about me than she. stopped needing me. Then I met a girl apparently good too good to be true and it took me 2 years to understand that she only wants my money. I cannot say no, I do not even want to say it because I worry so much when someone needs something. I work very hard. I am tired. Everyone uses me I always feel bad about my appearance and personality I cannot stop think about this I have a good heart but nobody cares Thanks for reading this I am an unhappy person but I know there are bigger problems than mine. sorry. I just wanted to say it People walk all over me",1
"I had to refill it yesterday and took it late today and I feel like shit (physically and mentally). I recently started my first job as a server and I do not know what to do now when I am not working. I have no friends, I still miss the person who emotionally abused me, keep changing my mind on what I want to do with my life, and just feel like everything is pointless a lot now. I know I am feeling extra shitty right now because I just took my medicine late but I really just want to escape.Nothing is appealing anymore except going to work because that means I get some social interaction even if it sucks. I want friends so bad but I have no idea how I am supposed to make them now without school. I just want to have a conversation with someone face to face who is not my family, therapist, or boss that is like ten years older than me. I am just so tired of being surrounded by only older people and no one my age. I feel like such a social fuck up for not having any friends or a bf/gf.I look at the person who was so shitty to me for so long and took everything from me and he is happy. He has a fucking girlfriend and friends and he is at a damn military academy. While I just waste away in the same town at a meaningless job.I am supposed to have a therapist appointment on Tuesday but I am also supposed to work so I am going to have to get it rescheduled. I have only had this job for two weeks and I already feel like it is all I do now.I just want something else in my life so bad. I just want to hang out with friends and joke around and happily exist. But I am so damn lonely it hurts so bad. I do not understand how I am supposed to make friends and I am afraid I am going to be lonely like this for a long time. I just want to not exist instead it just seems so much easier. did not take my medicine for like two days and I feel like shit already",1
"I have just began watching Boku no hero academia, I expected the level of sadness but something added. I was reminded of my life, my life is nothing but pain. Watching everybody there made me feel sad because everybody is out there improving themselves,achieving their dreams, having mentors, having adventures, and they feel pain but it is much more healthier than mine. Once the tv screen fades to black, I felt empty and sad, my depression began to show it is mean self again. All I could repeat to myself is ""my life is boring"", ""their not real"", bakugou's not real"", ""I am a coward"". This all repeats in my head as my chest felt heavy shit. I wish I could be in their world, a lot of destructions but I will be more free there, instead of being in the same house for many years not even allowed to go faraway. I feel like my reality will always be like this...empty, sad, boring, and filled with suffering. I do not even remember what it feels like to be happy about something. I want to go on and fight but what am I supposed to do with this feelings?, All I ever receive was negativity and this quarantine is making it fucking worst. Everytime a movie or music ends, I stare around my room and feel nothing but immense sadness and emptiness. it is so sad, I want to have an exciting life but it is so hard. I am sad over the fact that I am not in bnha",0
"I was feeling extremely, extremely ready to do it today. I was sitting on my floor sobbing because I had a ptsd flashback yesterday and all the friends I was with just left me. It was already terrifying and I have abandonment trauma on top of it, so them doing that made me spiral. Today I called my childhood best friend who I have been close to for over 20 years now, and he basically said I told you so and that its my fault because I do not want to move back to the city so I have access to better people and better friends.Then I reached out to my second best friend who I have known for around 6 years now and even lived with at one point, and asked him if he could come over because I was having a crisis and did not think I should be alone right now. His response was My girlfriend and I just went tubing and were tired I told my brother I was suicidal a few weeks ago and really needed his support and he told me hes too busy working and to give him 2-3 more years so he can buy a house. He does not even have any bills right now. He still lives in an apartment through foster care and could easily request less hours since he voluntarily picks them upEvery single friend I interacted with knows I have PTSD and am majorly depressed. Three of them know I am suicidal.Lmao everyone says if you are about to kill yourself to reach out and talk to someone but when you do, you get blown offLike I talk about how nobody actually cares about me and people scoff and act like there must be SOMEONE. No, there is literally nobody. I do not have parents, my brother is my only family and those few friends I have just do not give a shit. Literally my cats are the only thing keeping me here Everyone always tells you to reach out to someone if you are suicidal, but then when you reach out people do not want to deal with you.",1
there is nothing that can change my mind. I have everything ready. I hate this world so fucking much and I do not want to wait around to see what happens. Goodbye. I am going to kill myself today,1
"Just got hired as a dishwasher but I know it will not last(I will probably be fired in under a week), I am lazy, slow, I cannot handle the heat and I am too weak to take out the trash. I do not want this job but nobody else would hire me, I have gaps on my resume but that is not why they will not hire my, I did not realize how easy I had it in my previous job. I am 23 and wasted 5 years of my life, no money to go back to college(I am not sure I would do well even if I studied 8 hours a day though I never tried so who knows..), too dumb to think through my situation, I am currently under the care of a mental health team though they are wrong I am not the mentally I will they think I am, I am just straight up dumb. I have not worked in 1.5 years and am supported by my mother who is a hard worker even though she has rheumatoid arthritis. I want to be able to support myself but I cannot do any type of job even entry leveled ones, too slow mentally even more so when I am around people, too weak physically. The reason I am under the care of a mental health team is because I was suicidal a few months ago which caused me to visit the ER room, which then put me in the care of a mental health team upon my discharge. It feels like I inherited all the bad genes from my parents, the laziness of my father and emotional weakness of my mother. Have no friends either. I wish I had never been born, my mother deserves better, my mother might quite possibly be the only person that cares for me and I do not want to disappoint her but I really cannot do anything. I am just a burden to her but not once has she told me to leave. I have been struggling with depression my entire life, I like to think it is because of my brother but I am an adult now, I cannot just blame everything on someone else. I am trash and I deserve to die",1
"I have a sibling with BPD and psychosis. she is been suffering from depression since she was 12 years old and has attempted suicide multiple times. she is gone to multiple therapists, psychiatrists and private clinics. None of them have helped. Her arm is covered in scars and her mood swings are common despite her taking her meds. She constantly calls everyone around her selfish for wanting her to be alive when she does not want to be, and the only reason she is still alive is because we make her feel guilty(I read people on this sub do not like that phrase, so how else would you communicate your concern?). What can I do? She seems adamant, by refusing to believe she can change and is convinced this is what the rest of her life will be and that she will never know the why.I have literally no idea what to do anymore, how are things going to change when she just shuts everyone out and the fact that professionals could not even make a difference? Seeking help and advice.",1
"For most people, it seems like life is just mostly tiring, stressful and what applies to all of us is how pointless it is. Even before I was depressed there really was not all that much worth living for. And I was born into a middle class family with a great upbringing. I could not imagine how terrible it must be for those less fortunate than myself, which is the majority of the population.I feel like those who are happier and focus on the positives have to delude themselves into this mindset and pretend that all of the shit going on in their lives does not exist. Its kind of like nostalgia. When you are an adult, you reminisce on your childhood and remember how great and awesome school was. But that certainly was not what we were thinking at the time. Most of us hated school because it was boring, monotonous and forced us into behaving a certain way.And they say that your school days are the best days of your life... that is just terrifying. I am 19 and have not done anything since I left school. When I was 11 I knew this would happen. I cannot take care of myself or interact with people properly, so I knew Id be screwed once I was left to take on the world myself. My non-existent motivation, self-esteem and social skills are making the future look bleak for me. I do not want to become a wage slave in a depraved society that makes you wear a fake smile and pressures you into being like everyone else. And I cannot even be myself if I wanted to because I do not have a personality. Like is this really it? Working and working and more working until I die now? I hate this world, I hate humans and how greedy and destructive we are. I do not want to contribute in this. I want to leave. Do the moments of happiness really make life worth living?",0

"I almost took my life not even 24 hours ago and no person in my life will know. I internalize my pain so much that I cannot do otherwise. I wrote my suicide note and it said ""Life is beautiful PEACE LOVE AND FREEDOM"" because to me that is just what matters in the end of the day and in the end of my life. I am only 20 and I am on my 5th suicide attempt. I have diagnosed CPTSD, clinical depression with psychotic tendencies, BPD and bipolar disorder and maybe I am schizoaffective but my doctor is trying to find a way to tell me about it in a way that will not make me panic or be sadder. I can tell in the way he asks me questions and the way he talks to my mother, that he tries to find a way to let her know too without making her panic or be sad. I know I need to get hospitalized but I cannot. I will not tell anybody about why I believe so but I say so because I am in the verge of an actual serious mental breakdown, not the one that people make memes about. I am close to going to my job, and throw all of the high end luxury desserts that take hours to make on the floor and start screaming my lungs out of fucking nowhere and just run outside and start running, I do not think I will because harm upon anyone but if I can even slightly feel that maybe I will then I absolutely WILL go to the hospital. I just want to be put on sedatives, and sleep all day. I want to feel like I am dead. I want to feel as if I do not exist anymore. I want the feeling of no one remembering me or thinking about me. I just want to be no one, I want to cease to exist. I want to cease feeling and hurting and mania and psychosis and crying loudly and panic attacks and anger and rage and sorrow and desperation I do not want to feel all those shitty feelings anymore. I do not want my memories anymore. I have CPTSD because I was raped three different times by different people. I have flashbacks sometimes, not as frequently as I used to. But when I do I scream and cry and hit myself and I just cannot be reasoned with and calmed down without sedatives. I cannot have sex with my boyfriend. Everything reminds me of it. The third time it was very violent. I got beaten and bled out of my ear. And that is why I hate bathrooms with green tiles. My doc says we can try EMDR and we sure can. He says we can try the electricity therapy which the name of I do not know in English. We can try ketamine therapy, and SSRI antidepressants and all those other new methods. Although I am done for. I do not think I can be saved. Keeping me from taking my own life is selfish at this point. I ache so badly I feel so fragile that I think if I walk out, the wind will take me away and I will scatter, like dust and sand. My body is so frail, I slowly become weaker and weaker each day physically and feel like I need help with basic self care. I cannot eat food. I do not want it. I just cannot even swallow it. My body does not allow me to give energy to myself. Yet I wake up every day at 5 am after working for 17 hours the previous day to get shouted at and belittled. And I work for all these hours with no breaks and no complaining. Today I cried in front of everyone. I have a sort of intimidating appearance, I have tattoos and my haircut is extreme and these people must have thought I am some badass but I am not. I cried today after attempting to take my own life a few hours before. They will never ever know. No one will. Soon, I will die in my own terms. Because this life, I just cannot take it in MY hands and do something. I am unable to because I am a weak little fucker. Thank you for reading. I hope your day is lovely. Idk",1
"I have had issues with depression for a long time and have abused drugs and alcohol alot. Recently I have taken a break from the sauce and focused on working out and taking antidepressants. I have taken a large dose of pre-workout today and had a couple of drinks responsibly in a social setting. However I feel fucked, I just do not feel right at all. Does anyone have similar situations or recommendations? Alcohol and pre-workout",0
I am right at the edge of finally dying. I have everything I need. I am so fucking close. Why do I hesitate. This is what I have wanted for so long. I am right there and I cannot. I do not want to fail at this like I failed everything else. Why cannot I do it,1
"I feel like people took away my freedom. I am human being and I deserve to have my freedom to live, to do what I want, to be who I want. Why do I feel like I am in the box with all this people who are taking away everything? I want them to stop",0
At a pub for the euros final but my dumb cunt gender dysphoric brain is just like nah you cannot enjoy it. Fuck life man cannot take this shit anymore. Let me enjoy shit,0
I hate myself for everything I had ever done in my life. I think this could help me. do not question it. Just imagine the person you hate most in your life and say all the things that you wanted to say him/her. Just let it all out on me. No limits. Everything is permitted. Roast me as badly as you can,0
"Went for a walk to clear my mind, just kept looking as buildings, thinking how I can access to them and jumping off. Jumping off a building",0
"I have been battling ""The Big Sad"" for about 15 years now and I thought I was doing better. I stopped self harming, I had overall happier thoughts and did not even really want to die anymore. But lately, my suicide thoughts have gone from bone, to passive, to aggressive. I have been lying to everyone about how I feel just so they do not have to deal with the burden of it, I bought knife blades for the first time in almost a year for the sole purpose of using on myself just to feel SOMETHING!! I know my life is falling apart and I do not really feel like there is anything I can do about it. Almost every shower I have I come out of it with a new mark on my body. Almost every thought is how swiftly I can disappear and make sure no one acknowledges it. I do not know what to do or even what I want. I feel like my identity has been stripped away by depression. I have been a bad person",0
"I do not do anything serious in self harm but i scratch myself pretty badly and it really just does not bother me. I noticed that when i feel pain i have no reaction to it and i stay pretty stoic while its happening. Anyways, i thought i stopped caring about my problems. I have not, I have just gotten a lot less emotional about it. I used to cry about every night, i guess I have just had enough so now i just feel it all on the inside. I started being an asshole to my friends again, i do not really care about it though i just thought it was worth mentioning. Thanks for reading this if you did. It means a lot. If you did please comment that you did because more than anything it helps to know that people are listening. Thank you. Pain does not bother me anymore",1
The last few months I have been exploring my gender. I am AMAB. I always feel happy when I am dressed female or have makeup on or get nails done etc. I have also struggled with depression for my entire life and this year was diagnosed with anxiety/depression. The more I have leaned into gender searching though the more I have felt good. I just do not know at this point whether I am trying to escape my reality by using an alternative persona or if its just my ocd getting out of control. Thoughts? Is there a chance I am using the thought that I am trans as a way to escape my unhappiness?,0
I am in hospital right now. And I know exactly what to say so the let me out and I am going to say it. Fucking pathetic demons. they are going to let me out and they are going to pay for it This will not stop me,1
"I am so sorry she went through what she did. I was I could just give her a hug. So many people failed her, did not protect her when they had an obligation to. How do you forgive those people for hurting an innocent child My inner child is so hurt",0
"I got a new therapist who I had my second appointment with today. She asked me why I am so slow at opening up. And I told her that she probably will not get me anyways.So a little later I talked about how I do not think life is for me and that I feel I would be better off dead. And that bitch proceeded to tell me that I am selfish and a coward for wanting to die. I had to hold myself back so much from just saying ""and this just proves my point of you not understanding"". I will not visit any therapist again,I am sick of them all pretending to know how to help. This is the third time,I would rather give up. Therapists are useless",1
"I do not want help. I do not want to bother anyone. I just want to let the words out before I burst. Implode from the inside I am under the water. And I am struggling. I cannot feel my feet or arms. I have been fighting to swim for so long, I am just weak and exhausted. I am losing the fight. I feel drunk. Like my words are not coming out right. My body is numb. I cannot see straight through the flashbacks of everything. Every event. Every time I have been abandoned or betrayed. Every beating. From childhood to now. And I just. cannot. I have never fallen so deep in the black hole like this that I felt drunk before I gave in to drinking myself senseless, begging to feel anything else. I am not winning the battle. But I am terrified this is THE battle that ends the war. How do I keep going when everything in me has stopped fighting? When that voice in the back of my head that always pulls me through is even tired? I wanted a new life. Thought maybe if I started my new life it would get better. But nothing feels better in this moment. In this moment I feel like a failure. I just want the pain to stop. For the memories to quit screaming in my head on a repeat. On a constant loop. I am so tired of trying to swim against the current. I want so badly to just give in and let it wash me away. I just want it to stop. I am drowning",1
"I am angry, and sad, I want to scream, and cry. I want to hurt myself, or break something. I just cannot fucking handle this.I hate the fact that I am STILL waiting on therapy. Originally, I was waiting to hear about scheduling. Then I learned that no counselors could handle my schedule(I work till 7pm mon-Fri). So my supervisor said make it work, no matter what. I opened my schedule, but I think I am not going to hear anything back from them.I just need some way to cope with all these emotions. I want to be able to cope, and I used to think I could, but now that I am getting hit from every direction, I realize all I can do to handle it is break down and hurt myself. I promised I would not do it again, and now I just do not know what to do.I tried watching some YouTube, I tried smoking my vape. I would considering trying to play some games, but I will probably punch my laptop. If I go for a walk, I will end up punching a wall, and will make my work life harder, since I need hands. I even considered writing some poetry, but all that is coming to my head is FUUUCK I want to do something I will regret. cannot even jerk off, because I am porn free now, and if I use my imagination I would probably rip my dick off. So now I am sitting here, numb but feeling all of this at once. I am just scrolling reddit, not even reading the posts. I can barely feel my arms. I am considering going out and getting a 6pack, but I am afraid if I use it to cope once, I will use it to cope over and over again and I will end up a sad, lonely drunk, and then I will actually try to kill myself.I have got nothing right now, I cannot even talk to my friends about this, because there is secrets(not mine) they cannot know. Even if I talked to someone, they would probably not understand and try to twist things around, or argue what actually happened. I do not need that, I just need to feel better. My head is just so fucking noisy",0
"How are you guys and gals getting hooked up with people? Maybe I am socially retarded but I have never had a girl ask me out, and I do not know how to ask one out. I do not bother because I do not have a job and quite honestly I just get the feeling that everyone would be better without me. Even though I feel this way, it saddens me that I am alone. MDD makes it incredibly difficult to see what makes me happy. I have spent my entire adult life in my room, I am not kidding, like never going outside, getting a job, cleaning, nothing. I am just here, there is nothing that drives me so I do not bother trying. I want to do stuff but I feel everything is too slow and that I have to try and catch up for all the time I have wasted being an idiot. I am not very attractive when I think I am a stupid, worthless, sorry excuse for a human being. I feel like a parasite. My personality is being depressed and addicted to videogames, like who would want to offer this person a job or go out with them? What the hell do I do? I do not know where to start, the hole I have dug is so deep that I cannot even fathom reaching the top. Money is an issue and I feel it is the root of most of my problems.Aw man reading this back just makes me realize how undesirable I must appear to people, my inner thoughts speak the truth and I hate it. What could I possibly do to turn this around? What do I do?",0
I do not have anything to live for. I feel like shit every day. Nobody care about me. I do not know what to do with my life then just die. Literally thinking about suicide,1
I am so close to ending it I am about to have no one left. i fucking loved them my last two friends want to end our friendship,1
"I have been dating this girl for a year and a half, talking about marriage, future homes, pets, children. She cheated on me and ever since then I have felt worthless. Like living breathing garbage. She was my light, my rock, the person I confided all of my deepest secrets and darkest thoughts with, and now its just... gone. All I can think about is how nice it would be to just not feel this pain anymore. No more waking up everyday going through the motions of being alone, working a 9-5 that I hate with a passion, and coming back to an empty house. The worst part of it is there is no escape from her. She works with me. Nothing in life feels right anymore, its all upside down and I am falling. What do I do? Recently cheated on",1

"So everyone would remember be as the ""loving boyfriend"", ""caring relative"", ""hardworking student"", even if everyone around me thinks that it could not be away from the truth, if I just ""slipped"" somewhere and died tomorrow everyone would be saved from disapointment and get to keep their fake memories. I want to die as soon as possible",1
"I do not know what to do anymore. I did not get out if bed for two days and I finally got the courage to go out today. It went relatively well and I was remotely happy; I forgot what it feels lonely for bit. But the moment I got back to bed, everything came crashing down on me. My inadequacies, my faults, how unbelievably worthless I am, I just felt overwhelmingly tired. I keep messing up and saying the wrong things. I begged and begged for the universe to take me. I scratched and hit myself and thought about finally doing it. I made a video telling my parents how much I love them and how its not their fault, that I am just really really really tired and I want to rest now. I am scared because I am genuinely feeling how death could be so welcoming. I am scared and I am tired and I am lonely.",1
I have decided to drop out of school. I am beyond the point of caring and trying to fix my life again,1
"I was having such a shit day and was mentally exhausted even though I did not really do anything other than think. I found some peaches that were going mouldy so I told myself I would make a pie to use them up. I love cooking but I have never made a pie before, but let me tell you, it was... the most... motherfucking delicious thing I have ever tasted. If my dad was not next to me, I would have cried, honestly. I spent so much of my day criticising myself and feeling so worthless and angry and terrified and bitter and hopeless about my life. But then I made a nice pie. And as weird as it may seem, it made me so happy because I did not feel like a failure for a while. And it was a fucking great pie! And I am proud of myself! I cried because I made a pie",0
"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",1

"I am 26 years old and feel like I have let a lot of time pass by with a lot of things I have kept for myself. I am someone who never allowed himself to have fun and ever since I graduated college I have been lost. I lost all my skills since graduating since I did not put any of them into practice, and I used be so good. Now suddenly I am antisocial (i was working on my social skills and was doing kind of better towards the end) and I always failes at making connections with ppl from how awkward I am. It sucks because (not to brag) I am a very good looking person, dress nice, and put a lot of effort into my looks but always on flight mode and I am so so tired of it. I am putting my cat to sleep next week and its the first death I ever had to deal with. I am 26 and feel so fucking immature and I am ashamed of myself. Of the way I always was behind my girlfriends back, ashamed of all my thoughts, ashamed of letting my career go to waste and never having the motivation to move forward with it, and always ashamed to have any fun since for the first five years of our relationship she would not feel comfortable with me drinking (never got drunk till i was 22) or even smoking a bit of weed (she did not even know I smoked since I was 22 until COVID and I used that as an excuse to start). Barely ever partied, never travelled, and never got to develop socially. I am not blaming my gf btw, this is all me blocking myself because I was too codependent to admit anything and still am. I feel like Ill always be in this loop. Its a personal hell and the more I see myself aging the worse I feel. I writhe in my sleep at night as I am now. I am fucked. I have Lexapro but never took it, I am afraid of risking my creativity. I still write but I suck and am very slow. Oh well. Stuck in a loop vent",0

"I cannot hold a job, I cannot hold a romantic relationship, I cannot maintain social relationships. I am in pain everyday. I have been to about 30 therapist in 6 years and nothing helped even a little bit. I am tired of suffering, I am tired of being alone, I am tired of struggling to get a job only to lose it. I cannot take this anymore. I am tired of the platitudes, the empty positivity. People say it will be okay, just go to therapy - mindfulness and positive thing are a joke.Being raped messed me up sexually and now I cannot even find love. Being raped caused me to lose my job and my career. No one believed me, no one cared. My family disowned me, my company fired me. it is been years and I am still broken. I cannot relate to people anymore. I am trying so hard everyday and have nothing to show for it. I feel like Sisyphus rolling a boulder up a hill.If I was not a coward I would shoot myself. But I cannot do it, I am just too damn scared. I was born by accident, my mother was a drug addiction who abandoned me. Her drug use left me physically deformed. I wish she would had an abortion everyday. Maybe I was born by accident, but I will die with intention. World's a sick place with no room for a broken freak like me in it. I will see myself out. Good bye. Being raped, abused, and bullied has left me a she will of a person and I am tired of being broken and suffering.",1
"She pulls me back in.I was doing great, keeping good hygiene, working out, having fun at my job, enjoying my friendships and summer. I was pretty much depression-free for 3 weeks. It felt like a massive weight was lifted.This past weekend I visited a friend and did some molly, it was surreal. An absolutely amazing experience. On day 2 of the comedown (molly has notoriously depressing comedowns) my ex decided to reach out yesterday. She said she wants to try again and start talking again. Wow I felt great. Then today she says I just want to be able to talk when I need to and that she does not ever see us getting back together. I feel like I just got thrown into the deepest depths of depression instantly. I went from feeling validated to utterly used and worthless. did not have a suicidal thought for weeks, had not SHd in weeks. And now I am watching the blood stream from my leg thinking of ways to end it all. How does shit go so bad so quickly?? I really thought I had it beat and now I am as depressed as ever. 6 months ago I would have told you I would marry this girl, and now she is ruining my brain and my life. Every thought is bad. Just when I thought I was out.",0

"I do not understand.&amp;#x200B;I have been bullied when I was a kid for being fat. My mother always protected me, but not in the right way. I used to love her with all my heart.

"You look in the mirror and you do not recognize who you are. Its like everything that has ever broke you a little bit at a time is staring right back at you. Just darkness. All your mistakes, the people you have lost, the time you have wasted, the scars you have, everything is just looking back. you are anger shame, sadness, and anxiety is just right there. Its just seeping out of you and you realize you are only living because somebody needs you to live and not because you want to. you are feelings and trauma is eating you slowly from the inside and you want to put holes in walls and rip the whole world down before you finally shatter that mirror and put one of the shards through your throat to finally end it. You hate yourself and your tired of the hurt. You are finally what you said you would never be and want to make yourself suffer, but you hate the world and want to make it suffer with you. You know its too late for you when",1
"Throughout the past years I have been stuck in rock bottom, facing the biggest depressive episodes I have ever had to deal with, but recently I somehow overcame it all together and started putting my life back together.That is all nice and good but the haunting question that got me down years ago is creeping back up, what is the point? I do not wish to have a overly successful life or to gather achievements, I just want to be happy, but happiness never lasts.I see no reason to struggle with the adversities of life because there is nothing for me to gain in doing so, in fact all the effort involved probably would get me farther away from happiness.I wish I could enjoy this world and live a ""normal"" life, but deep down I know that it is simply not meant to be. I have been slowly pushing away everyone in my support network because there is nothing they can do if I do not want to help myself.I have tried everything, but suicide is always the ultimate answer, afterall I never wanted to be here anyway, I am tired of pretending that I do. Guys I cannot see a way out",1
"I had not had this bad of an episode in awhile. Just feeling so empty and sad. No other emotions. Pushing people away from me. Actually blocked my bf half an hour ago. He called me a few times. I just want to be left alone but at the same time hold, so that I could cry my soul out while being comforted.I just want to be dead. Wanted to hurt myself, could not bring me to it. The scars will be an ass to tattoo over.How can I stop this? Its just an downward spirale. Why do I have to suffer from this? Maybe I deserv it. cannot wait to die in an accident so my family would not be that sad. Bad episode out of nowhere",0

Like why I keep going when I am barely functional anyway.I do not come across as suicidal or even unstable just maybe very traumatised and absent minded. Its ruined friendships and relationships. It ruined a relationship with a guy I was seeing, and also the next guy I dated.I am just tired. What does it mean if I have not gone through with it yet",1

"I started having suicidal thoughts as a teenager, I am 23 now, sometimes these thoughts just stop for a while when everything is going good but they always come back. When i was young, i thought they will probably just stop sooner or later but they never really go away you know what sucks? there is no point in discussing or sharing it with someone. they will never understand. Heck they would probably blame you for having these thoughts. If you have ever battled with these, do they ever stop? Does it ever stop?",1
"Hi, I am 22(M) and I do not know what depression really is but rn I feel irritated over every fuckin thing, I cannot sleep properly, nothing exciting is happening in my life.

I have had good times with friends, yet when I analyze the times after, I do not ever feel that I was happy.I am at the point where I just feel burdened by other people as they attempt to lay claim to me in some odd selfish attempt to stop me from committing suicide. I do not get why their short-term pain weighs so much more than my long-term. Life is suffering and pain. There is no golden time, besides brief blips of time that things are okay. But everything ends up at the same baseline: shit. I fucking hate it all. I hate the burdens of life, I hate having others attempting to make me stay, and I hate that I still have not killed myself. When was the last time?",1

"Tomorrow morning I will walk to this view point park to watch one last sunrise. I will have some weed, liquor, couple morphine pills, and my 9. That part is decided and final. But today, I am at a lost with what to do with myself. cannot decide if I want to watch sad shit or happy shit. Listen to depressing music or some of my favorites one last time. Play competitive match based games, newly added content for current games, or replaying parts of games that I have already beaten and adored. cannot decide if I want something extravagant as my last dinner or tried and true greasy fast food like after nights of barhopping. The only thing I have decided is how and when it will end.I will say I wish it was not spent being alone. My family all had a trip to Bellingham planned for this weekend. I was supposed to see my grandma too who I have not seen in 10+ years, but I knew seeing more family might because hesitation in me. They all left today, even took my dog with them. I told them I had other things to take care of first and I would come up Saturday or Sunday to join them. It was damn near impossible to fight and hide my tears when we said our goodbyes, i held each of them a little longer and tighter, little did they know that was our final farewell.

My first time being out on the streets i slept under a bridge in the local nature area and went to my ex partners the next day, my dad was never the nicest, he used to scare me a lot and i still have a hard time dealing with what he used to do and being lied, cheated on by multiple partners, i do not know if its too much information for you guys, i just need a friend, even though i have friends, it just feels like i cannot talk to anyone, or be good at anything, i can never be happy with anything i do or try to do. i do not know what to put",1
"I do not know why but I am constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I did not really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one did not really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just do not fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I have had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I could not cut. I kind of feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I cannot talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I am sorry if this was too long a read. I am Lonely",1

"So I am just tired of my life and want to die. Basically I am depressed because of my emotionally abusive father, failing at college (on the verge being drop out because Ill probably not be able to finish my final thesis on time), and I have experienced a very traumatic unsafe abortion that still haunts me till this day. I know I should get help but therapy around here is shit (I have tried). I have around a month left before all hell breaks loose (getting dropped out of college + family will be enraged + I still have nightmares about past trauma). The question: should I just enjoy living for a month and kill myself or try for a month to do all the responsibilities? But if the latter fails, I will probably end up killing myself. The thing is, a part of me still wants to see if I can fight these problems but the other part of me just want to die. I do not know what to do. Should I continue to try to live or give up?",1

Yeah she technically stalked me but it was I begging her to love me but I was scared of being open. Now I am a psychotic mess. I just quit my job again and the anxiety is too much.

"I am 15 years old, and a friend of mine the same age that I have known since I was 6 years old had just face time called me, he was very drunk, taking shots on camera, this was maybe his 3rd time drunk I have never drunk, I think its wrong but I let people do their thing. We have this fun conversation, hes basically just giving me so many confessions, hes bisexual, he kissed a guy even though he has a girlfriend, listed a bunch of people from our school he finds attractive, Sure I am worried about him getting drunk, but the fact that it is not much then I do not mind so much. But i have known for a very long time that he suffered from ADHD and a bit of depression, never really saw it as any thing serious because I knew he was happy with a lot of struggles within, but while on this call He then comes to me and shows me his arm and its full of cuts, he was bragging about it sorta and said he has a kink of hurting hinself like putting a lighter on his finger tips, he said he would never hill himself because he has a girlfriend (his drunk self talking) but I am still worried about him, I am planning to give him a call in 2 days when he is sober and just talk to him about it and see if he needs my support in any way. And I just remembered his parents divorced recently so that might mean something idk, but I do what to do, can anyone here help me out? Friend cutting himself",0
"Every so often on an askreddit thread I see a post about what men want more of and every time one of the top replies is compliments. I have never been able to relate, I do not say that to be arrogant, just to provide context and hopefully some people reading this may stop judging themselves and others based on appearances. Often through my life I have been told I should model, or complimented on my looks, which is rare as a man, but this has never translated into healthy relationships due to anxiety. I grew up with acne until I was in my early 20s and bullying left me with debilitating social anxiety. When I drank it went away but that is never a good strategy. At 25 I finally faced down a few of my demons and with the aid of liquid courage for the first time pulled a one night stand whilst travelling, when it came down to it I could not get hard. I had to jerk myself off to the point of almost finishing so when I did enter I lasted two strokes. After this I dated but felt too nervous about sex to follow up on promising dates, I remember one date with a girl that seemed a very good match, I cancelled on her hours before we were meant to meet twice because of anxiety. A couple years later I started going out and managed to pull a few more one night stands, each time the same routine, I would be hard and ready to go, then have anxiety at the point of penetration and lose my erection. Girls were put off by this and even those who had been chasing me down for second and third dates stopped messaging. This made me feel like an abject failure, I looked around at everyone around me, all able to do this fundamentally human thing, and felt isolated for not being able to follow through with the one thing that is the reason any of us are here in the first place. Since then I have gone through the cycle a few times: avoiding dating altogether -&gt; downloading the apps and sorting myself out with dates -&gt; taking a girl back to mine and going limp at the point of penetration -&gt; avoiding dating altogether -&gt; and on and on.At this point its not just the sexual inexperience but the inexperience with relationships that only further entrenches my feelings of being an outsider who will never fit in. I am now 30, my friends are marrying or having children, and I am unable to do anything more than smooth talk a girl into bed (and then fail to penetrate her). This is a deep source of shame for me, noone would guess this about me, I feel like a fraud. Some friends have told me they assume I am a fuckboy, it would be interesting to see their reactions if they found out how wrong they were but I am too deeply ashamed to share this w anyone. If I play this out to the future I am not sure what happens. When I was younger I had hope in figuring it all out, but that hope is quickly fading. I have tried cialis, I have entertained loading up on a high dose and visiting prostitutes until I am desensitised to sexual anxiety, but sometimes I feel fated to stay stuck where I am, and that makes for a very bleak outlook. If you read this far thanks, aware I am ranting now. Erectile dysfunction and alienation is ending me",1

"First and foremost I want to clarify that I recommend anyone and everyone to at least try therapy if you are struggling mentally, seriously. This is more based off of personal experience and yours could be totally different. Lots of people have had their lives saved from it. For me, though, I feel like I am so hopeless and such a lost because that therapy will not do much for me. I feel like this because I am not actually going to make the effort to do anything a therapist tells me to do. Whether that be eating better, exercising more, journaling every day, whatever else. there is tons of great advice therapists have in store, but I do not have enough effort to actually do any of it. that is on me obviously, I do not blame anyone else for my lack of effort. Its just how I feel whenever I think of trying therapy again. I feel like therapy only works if you are actually willing to better yourself.",0
For the longest time I have had suicidal thoughts and wanted to escape but could never bring myself to do it. But when I found out about shifting I was so happy because I had finally found a way to escape without having to actually die. I became very invested (not to the point of my obsession though) and have been trying to shift for about a year now. I have never been successful. Ever. I see posts of people being able to and I try to let that keep me motivated but I just cannot anymore. I am so impatient and I just want to be in a place where I am happy so bad and I do not want to wait anymore. Now I am back to suicidal thoughts and am genuinely contemplating suicide. I am an absolute disappointment to everyone. There is nothing keeping me happy here. I do not want to be here. I am not even doing well in school. I am just a waste of breath. I do not understand the point in trying anymore,0

All I have is hatred and even though I know a big part of why I am here is for reasons that I can only blame my self, I cannot let go of the other half that they did to lead me down this path.

I am only 17 and i feel so left behind and absolutely helpless, i do not see my future, i never really have. she does not even allow me to go out unless its for school. she even takes my money that i earn from my school and tells me that I am greedy because i hesitate whenever I am about to give it to her. i cannot begin to imagine what she will do if she finds out i secretly have piercings, that I am closeted, i smoke, and i wear trousers outside. i genuinely cannot live with her or anyone else in this family. i refuse to live the rest of my life like this or ill really hate myself. everyday i wake up feeling like I have got a large boulder on my chest I am unable to cry, its so hard for me. i cannot imagine myself running away because i come from a large community. i really only see one way out. my mother does not realise how overbearing she is. i genuinely cannot stay with her or here.",0

I stopped wanting them to do it at our house because I do not drink anymore and I want the house clean on Monday morning and his friends always overstay their welcome and spill beer everywhere, and are disrespectful. Have you ever seen the movie Mother! with Jennifer Lawrence? That is how I feel when they come over all weekend. I am 3 weeks into quitting cannabis, which is highlighting my lonliness. I think weed gave me social anxiety and I was content to be alone and work on art or other introverted activities. Now I feel so depressed and alone. I have cancelled with friends and I may have alienated most of them because of my flakiness. My fiance is good to me in so many ways and I think its important he hangs out with his friends without me. I could go hang out with him but I hate how drunk and stupid they are, and they smell like my alcoholic dad which makes me feel nauseous. they are having a bro night and say sexist shit. I am kind of a bitch to my fiance when he is around and starts getting too drunk and annoying, like I will correct him if he repeats himself too many times or says some obvious or grandiose shit so he leaves.

In my fantasies I would like to meet a person(a man or a woman) who thinks and feels just like me. Hug him/her and cry until I do not have tears anymore.

For short periods of time I believe in real intimate human connections. Until very immediately I realize it is just fucking fake. I do not want to die. I think I am not suicidal. Onetime in life many years ago, I decided to die but I could not complete it right at the point. I was afraid of sth. I had hope that things can change over time. But so far it did not. Actually I think that if things have gotten worse. I wish things change soon for better. Because it is just painful now. This feeling is intolerable. Suffocating.

The feeling of hopelessness and being worthless gets more intense, I get more anxious, have panic attacks and get more irritated. I feel more overwhelmed with everything. Stress gets to me more. To the point where Id rather die or kill myself than deal with the stress/life. Thoughts like life is pointless and not worth it also get more intense. I am trying to think of everything. Oh I isolate myself. I dissociate more often. Basically, all the shit I feel regularly feels more and more intense.Eventually I reach this point where it feels like I just cannot take it anymore, I cannot take being in my own mind. I cry and feel so frustrated, everything just feels so overwhelming I almost seriously consider doing something about it. Where its like this is it, I should just do it But I do not. And after that peak for the next few days I feel fine. Like everything is great and I feel motivated.

"One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I am lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I have tried the gym, running, tennis, football, joining a hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. Maybe it is because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop. How do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time??Anyone have any advice? How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it??",0
"Today is my son's birthday. 10yrs ago he was 6yrs old. We had a big party with all his friends and an Indiana Jones cake! We even had the 501st in attendance. For those who do not know, the 501st is a volunteer group of Star Wars enthusiasts that visit children in hospitals. My son had been diagnosed with a terminal cancer and passed away just 2 weeks later. I was also going thru a divorce at the time. My ""husband"", despite being my son's step-father and knowing my son since the age of 2, rarely visited us in the hospital and attempted to make me feel guilty on the occasions he did. I was also fired from my job, despite being a full-time employee for several years and requesting time off in advance. (that is, uh, service Industry for ya, I guess)Despite being homeless, jobless and grieving, I was determined to soldier on, so I found an apartment and lived in hermit-ude for another year and a half. In spite of a sketch boyfriend and an even sketchier ex-husband trying to worm his way back into my bed, I somehow managed to find a job and some emotional stability and even had another child!Things were kind of swell for a bit until.....they just were not. I was stuck at home all the time. The house was always ""under construction"" and I could not spend time with my friends.it is not one big thing, it is allllll the little things. I cannot tolerate living like this anymore. Everything is disorganized and chaotic. I do not have the energy to clean and even if I did, it would only make me anxious, as the entire house is a construction zone that we just so happen to live in. there is no exit strategy or end game, it is just my partner, subbing out jobs a couple of times a year to sketchass dudes who show up whenever, for the past 4yrs. Everything is covered in some type of tile dust or trim dust or plywood dust or sheetrock dust and I am apparently allergic to all of it. I take Zyrtek, Allegra, hydrozene and Benadryl daily. I feel worthless. there is no further benefit to my existence on this planet. Can I please rest now? I Lost My Child",1
I always try to seem happy around others but when I am alone I just want to end it all. Just help,1
"We as humans have normalized being hurtful. Think of how many times you have called somebody a name in the last month, or even today. Think about how many times you have heard somebody else call somebody a hurtful name in the last month, or even today.Why have we normalized this behavior? Why have we not normalized communicating about a problem? let us relate this to a situation.Somebody cut me off today while I was driving. They cut right in front of me, causing me to have to swerve right and slam on my breaks to avoid hitting them. What is the normal response to this situation? ""That ASSHOLE!"". Maybe a middle finger? here is what I did after slamming on my breaks. I thought, ""I wonder if that was on purpose."" Then I kept driving. Just look at a debate show. When I watch *almost* any debate show I see two adults with a goal. It seems that the goal is to make the other person look stupid. If I look almost anywhere I see people being aggressive, name-calling, violence.Suicide rates are at a all-time high. Hell, If I told you I never had the thought of putting a gun to my head, I would be lying.How do we as humans change this normalization? Sad world",0

"No matter what the method is, killing yourself is always going to be awful. And when you have such little motivation to do anything its hard to psyche yourself up to just do it. But if killing myself was as simple as pushing a button, Id have done it long ago. I am not afraid of dying, its the thought of having to continue living that terrifies me. If I could kill myself by pushing a button Id have done it long ago",0
"I am honestly not doing so fucking hot. I have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. I really do not know what is going on with me. At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone more than anything. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but all I want to do is cry. Fuck, I need a hug. vent",0

Boss checked my water bottle and smelled my vodka he did not want to fire me so he gave me a week suspension. The day I get back my dumb ass thinks its smart to drink at work again.

Also sorry this is cringe but with 0 friends ig Reddit the next best thing. I got fired,1

"Since I cannot find any painless ways / convenient ways to commit suicide, I can only do it via the hard way. I just want to make sure it will be fatal and I will not survive it.

"Not looking for pity. Just want to get this out there. Also Ill probably end up deleting this eventually. Backstory: Queue the clich ultra successful father and I am just a dipshit fuckup story. I am his first born son. I have never lived up to his expectations, flunked out of college, and now I work in a call center and live with a roommate because I cannot afford to live on my own. You know, that old chestnut. My grandpa, who was a huge father figure in my life after my parents divorced, committed suicide a couple years ago. I developed a raging alcohol addiction which hung around even after I had mentally gotten over the initial shock. In spite of this, everything was actually going well. I lost 60 pounds on keto, was lifting and running 5 miles a day, but then covid hit and the gyms shut down. Then I fucked up by not getting back into exercising once they reopened. I started drinking myself into a stupor (and still do) every day and night. At work, they forced us to start taking regular old loyalty calls since were some of the most tenured agents. Yup, I have been getting yelled at professionally for the last 5 fucking years. I went from customer service, to tech, advanced tech, advanced internet tech, providing internal support to other agents, commercial support and sales for businesses, but now, this fucking loyalty shit is insane. I was getting through it, working with my boss to handle these calls better, but sweet Jesus, the loyalty department is just not my fucking jam and have always known that I never wanted to go there. I get that they must have looked at all their options and said well shit we have nobody else to take these calls so were going to have to make them do it, but at the same time, my job is so vastly different from what it was before and is now mostly handing a call type that I have avoided like the plague that it just fucking feels unfair. I get off work and just start slamming shots, chugging beer, and sitting outside smoking for an hour after work. Every. Fucking. Day. On days off, after I have had my caffeine and have woken up, I start drinking by 9-10 am. Shit, I am outside drinking and chain smoking as I write this. I was not even doing any of that before this loyalty bullshit. This job is literally slowly killing me. Problem is, I am making like $23 an hour and do not know where the fuck else I can go to make even close to that. I have 0 skills...I did not intend for this to be so long. So now to the present. My dog died 2 weeks ago and that just fucked up my whole world. I work from home and had him there to comfort me all day and now I just feel so alone. I was starting to feel somewhat normal and then a week and a half later my grandma passed away. And I just have to put a fucking smile on while people tell me to eat shit and die all day now. FUCK!Plus there is just the overarching feeling of doom and gloom with this covid bullshit. Like since its endemic, I guess were going to have constant lockdowns and vaccines shoved down our throats. Fucking awesome. I guess my best years are behind me. Hit with a bunch of shit all at once and just need to word vomit and get this off my chest.",0

"I never expected to make it this far for so long all I have had on my mind is I am going to do it I will take myself out that now I have made it this far i feel lost like I have got no path no direction because for so long death was what i had planned for myself but I have never been able to do it but in my head I have done it countless times over each a different scenario each a different method, I have been like this far awhile and every year that passes the thoughts do not stop I just find another excuse ""but they will miss me"" comes to mind a lot but then when I think about it more the only thing they will miss is being able to make me the front of all their inside jokes or hushed whispers. I think a lot of the reason of having not attempted it yet does not stem from fear but more just never having the space to do so just a little ramble vent type situation",0
"I have been feeling *really really* low again for the past few weeks. Today I woke up at 1 and have not gotten out of bed. its now 4... I started thinking about killing myself so I wrote a letter for my gf to have incase I did, and it kind of helped me in a way. Describing why I did it, in past tense, gave me a realization that the problems in my life are either stuff I should not care about or are not as bad as I think. I even laughed at myself sometimes. Because the whole time I was writing, I was trying to justify why I did what I was planning to do, to someone who I care about more than anything, and none of them were justified enough to hurt her that much. writing my suicide note gave me relief. made me feel like everything was ok. It even made me able to get started on my new captioning job and make some money. But is this healthy? Are suicide notes a healthy coping method?",0
"I am suicidal, now the fuck am i supposed to do. I am literally a child ,13, and want to already die so what am i supposed to do? I was born as a female and even tho I am still young and ""kids do not know what they are yet!"", i hate it, I have wanted to be a boy ever since i was six but at the same time some days i feel like a girl and it confuses me even more. I have had thoughts of killing myself for not being born as a male, these used to be rare but over the years I have just been thinking about it so much that i get the thought every day, and i do not know how to get rid of it. I have tried to tell others so i can get help but the only one who knows is my online friend and he keeps telling me to tell my mom but I am scared. My mom thinks that all kids my age are just looking for atenttion and i belive that if i even try to tell mom anything about me feeling suicidal she will just ignore it and think I am trying to get atenttion, same with my friends so i have no one i can talk about this to. I have been thinking since this is too hard to deal with for me that i should just kill myself and it will all be over but then i snap back into reality and realize what I am planning on doing and i just start crying. I also have tendency to over think everything and it does not make the situation esier and just makes me mad. I get super pissed off really easily and I have noticed that anytime anything goes wrong in my life i just start planning how i could kill myself since i do not want to deal with it.I have not seen my friends in a while since i stay awake the nights and sleep the days and every time i have a chance of hanging out with them I am scared to cuz i think they will just shit talk me behind my back.

"I have been positive for HSV2 (genital herpes) for 2 years now, and after my pap smear last week I discovered I also have HPV. The doctor said she does not know what kind I have and will not test to see what kind because I am young (24). Having HSV and HPV greatly increases your chances of cervical cancer. I have been fighting suicidal ideation for years anyway, why keep trying? I have booked an appointment with my therapist for next week but need to stay out of The Dark Place until then.

All i could do was thinking about how much i want to be dead already.At some point I was so deep in my thoughts that i did not notice STOP sign. I almost got hit by a car at a crossroads. Shame it was small intersection with 30km speedlimit so driver menaged to stop before hitting me. I wish he was a traffic pirate and drove over 100. I honestly had like 40 minutes to home from that crossroad and all i could think about was how much i regret he did not kill me right there. I am not even lucky enough to get killed on a road.

"I am not feeling the way I felt in the past. I am scared of calling it depression because most people think of my actions as ""just for attention"" and that I am overreacting. It is always the same words ""You are a man you should be..."". Everyday I am feeling more and more detached from reality, like I know I should not be like that, that I should not feel like this during certain times but I just cannot help it. what is even worse I feel like I do not want this pain to go away. I often cry at night thinking how great it is to just feel the strongest feeling in the world, the sadness. Girlfriend is getting angry at me because of the way I act, She wants normal life not some ""pussy"" that gets anxiety attacks over the smallest things. I feel like I am burden for her and the way she does not understand me makes me think question our relationship. Family understands only basic things just as the girlfriend, they do not understand how I can be stressed over future, how anxiety makes me unable to do certain tasks, how THEY can be the reason I developed some fears. At this point I do not know who is right, do I really have the right to feel like this? or maybe they are right that I just create my own problems? I would really like to be alone or at least have some one who understands these random bursts of fear and sadness and does not question the way I am.

"Hi, lately I have been feeling really depressed and I do not know the reason, I have been crying for several days too. Some days are better fortunately but I feel stuck and worried about the impact of my mental health on my future. I cannot get therapy because my mom said I did not have problems when I opened up to her for the first time (I am 17 btw), I guess some parents are not open minded and understanding enough to understand mental illness. When I try to have fun I cannot enjoy it, I always feel either sad or numb. I remember the times when I was not even feeling depressed like that. I hope it gets better one day, but I feel guilty for doing nothing for it. I tried to read books about mental health but I do not have the motivation for it yet. I feel pretty lonely too, I just have some support on the internet but nothing in real life because I struggle to open up to people. Feeling so depressed and hopeless",0
"I have struggled with depression for a long time. I go through cycles of being good and then I slip back into a depression.. it can last anywhere from a few days to weeks to months. Over the years I have learned how to identify when I am starting to slip into a depression. Messier house, sleeping more, not caring about work (even though I just got my dream job), not showering, not talking to people etc. But I do not know how to fix it. I deactivated my social medias today as well.. which I have never done. Idk. Its scary to feel the start of the downward slope and know you are going to end up in a hole you cannot climb out of.

He was always an understanding and caring friend. He knew what I struggled with, and he was always ready to listen. I loved him. I knew that if he dies before me, I will be extremely lonely. I cannot believe that I was not able to pet him and wish him goodnight this evening...I feel so broken without him. He was part of my soul. Without him it is like part of me is gone.I miss you.

"Good morning!I have a question regarding medication here in Germany. I am in psychotherapy for over a year now with a wonderful psychologist, the thing is, my psychologist lives in Crete, Greece due to the fact that my partner is Greek and it is nearly impossible here in Germany to get a psychologist if you are ""normal insuranced"". In Germany there are two types of health insurances, based on the field you work in. Privately insuranced people are usually higher income. The majority of people are health insuranced as required by law, which usually covers everything, but to get an appointment for specialized doctors, not only talking about psychiatrists, but also talking about doctors like dermatologists, it is a huge advantage to be privately insuranced , because most doctors either only accept privately insuranced patients, because they bring in more money, or do not accept anymore patients at all. Now to me. I am a 30 year old male who struggles with mental health issues since I was 19. I always coped with them by myself, because I was gay who was not out yet and because of that always single. That changed when I was 24, when I came out and I thought Now my life would change, which it did first. When I met my current partner 5 years ago, I was over the moon. Life was good, I had a good job that made me happy, money was stable, I was in love. After 6 months, my problems started. I always had a social phobia, but not in like being afraid about other people, I have never had problems with others. More like going outside, meaning agoraphobia. I always coped with it by myself and after some time my symptoms (all related to my stomach - nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, or in general the urge to go to the toilet immediately as soon as I have to go somewhere) would get better. But when it got worse when I was together with my partner, it did not get better ever since. I talked to him when it started (April 2017) what my issue was and he was, and still is, very understanding, all in all a great man. But life happens. He also had some problems at work, and I really try to support him, but I am not always able to do that because of my agoraphobia, because to relax he just loves to go outside or travel, which I cannot do. And I am noticing, that this is affecting him as well. After some time, maybe after 2 years, he encouraged me to look for a psychotherapist. I do not know how it works elsewhere, but here in Germany a psychotherapist is not allowed to medicate you if necessary, for that you need a psychiatrist. So I looked for one. I found two here jn Germany, but with both them, I did not really get along with them and I did not feel comfortable with them. And then I found my current psychotherapist, who lives in Greece, we have appointments over the internet once a week and we FaceTime. She is really wonderful and diagnosed me with depressions and suggested to look for a psychiatrist to talk about medications. And that is where the problems start. it is basically impossible for me to find one , because they either only take in privately insuraned patients (which I am not) or do not accept any patients at all. And I notice that my partner is slipping away. He coped with me for 5 years now and was so patient, but I think his patience is getting to an end. Which I understand. He gave up so much for me the last few years (not travelling) , which makes him happy , and also struggles with his own problems, and he cannot really do anything good for him, because he just wants to travel with me, or at least just go out somewhere, which he cannot with me. I try, but as soon as the day comes when we planned something, I feel sick, basically run in the bathroom every five minutes. And it shows. I really try to not let him see that, because I want to make him happy, but of course he notices and at the end we end up not going somewhere or we do not go out at all. I manage now to go out a little bit ( there is a Caf right next to our place and there is a park nearby where we hang out) but we only do these two things, and it is boring him, which I understand. Because he just wants to do stuff. And it hurts me to see that he is in pain because of me, because I also affects him mentally. He also goes out with his friends, but he just really want to do other stuff with me too, for which I love him , because he just wants me to feel better. And it would devastate me to see him suffer more. Or worse, if he would leave me... which I would I kind of understand though.So, dear readers, has anybody any suggestions? Or people from Germany, do you have any idea how to get an appointment at a psychiatrist, in hope that a medication would help me? Thank you! In search of a psychiatrist in Germany",0

"So much shit happened lately. I lost my job, relationship, a place for living, money. I do not want to be here since always. I have even started asking questions about my future suicide - is it by fall (if so, blindfolded maybe? or while being really intoxicated?) or by waiting for a train to smash my head on the tracks.I will commit suicide. I gave it a solid thought or two. Just do not know when and where. Today? In few days? Abroad? I have decided. I am doing this.",1
"I was going to type something long but ill just keep it short.got to keep on pushin till i cannot no more. that is what I am trying to do. Yeah. I got my gun, got my lil boolet in there. I put it in my mouth and look at myself in the mirror and scream n shit with my finger on the trigger and the barrel up against the roof of my mouth. But then somehow good news comes through at the last minuteAnd i just think.... not yet. I still got shit to do.

"You are not alone, trust me. We all face our hardships, we each have our own individual struggles and issues. We may feel alone, not loved, and gotten to the point where suicide/self-harm is the best solution. Well trust me, it is not. I have come a long way myself, as I am sure you guys have as well. We need to take it one step at a time. On my twitter, I post frequent motivational quotes and nice messages, with funny ones, and I am beginning to work on a massive group chat/server where everyone alike can realize they are not alone. They are loved and have a lot going for them even if they may not realize. I never had anyone, nor do I have anyone right now. I have come to the realization I will never have anyone, but that does not stop me from smiling, because helping others makes me smile. My goal is to help and prevent many people from falling in the endless blackhole that I have experienced. If anyone is interested, lmk :)If we never meet again, just know you are an amazing person and you need to realize time is the best medicine. It is not easy to let go of things, but accepting it and using to move forward is the best we can do. This applies to anyone facing any hardships or struggles. Yes you",0
"I have tried therapy for about 4 months now. There has been a problem that i just cannot stop thinking about (not a problem with the therapy). I had not had the courage to talk about it. A week ago i tried talking about it. But when he did he just told me the problem was not there, and to just think good thoughts about it. I did not know what to say. So i quit. What to do now? My therapist does not belive me",0
"When I feel depressed and in pain, it feels very relieving to think that I can just commit suicide. Just fantasizing that this can all be over if I want eases the pain. Its like a backup thought, if anything I can just kill myself and it will all be ok. Thinking about suicide gives me relief",1
"Thought Id been doing a little better but I was a half a second of impulse away from driving off the highway. I do not even feel like from afar I am that bad but the worst part is that it was just instinct when I saw this spot, I looked at it and my first thought was I could easily drive off the road there and no other cars would be involved.

But who am I to tell you really? I tried drinking more than my dosage and boy did I have the best sleep in my life. Sleep is safety. Although when you wake up you will be disoriented and suffer memory loss for a couple of days. Drink your meds responsibly do not overdose!!!,1
"Shit happens in cluster you all. This has been a long week already. My dog died, one of my work projects is failing (for many reasons), I bombed an interview for a job I really wanted, I missed a health appointment and am being charged up the butt for it, and now I have had someone bail on a agreement. I feel like a total failure. Is this depression talking or is it a shitty week? How can I move past all this? Bad Week",0
I felt nothing but I read it will take about 2 weeks before I might feel something. I hope I will feel happiness and I hope it will free me from this fucking brain fog that stuns me from doing almost anything productive.I also hope the medication will work for a long time and not stop working after a few weeks or so. Took my first antidepressant today,0
"I feel awful inside and out. I have been depressed since I was a child. Its absolutely fucking exhausting. I am a single mom now so I am stuck. Every time I think of a way to end it, I think about her and the fucking guilt is overwhelming. I have nothing. From the outside looking in, I appear as if I am doing okay. I own a business, my daughter is [mostly] happy, and Ill post positive things on social media. I am actually fucking dying inside. My business has essentially bankrupted me. I have no fucking money. I am always trying to figure out how I am going to take care of my daughter, put gas in the borrowed car I drive because mine does not work anymore, and how I am going to eat. I am tired of living like this. The only thing keeping me from falling apart was my person but he and I have not been getting along and after a huge argument yesterday I know things will never be the same. I am absolutely heart broken and I feel like a failure. I slept in today (thankfully my daughter did too). I took her to a park, used a gift card I had to get her food and a $5 toy. Made sure she had a great day. We drew pictures and colored together. She had a great day. I am now in bed crying and she is with her grandmother. I just want to end it so fucking badly. I am so, so, so sad. I cannot stop crying. Everything hurts. My face is swollen. I am on the fucking internet crying about my stupid fucking life. I feel so fucking pathetic. Why cannot I just be okay? Why is my brain like this? Why am I like this? I try so fucking hard and get nowhere. I wish something would happen accidentally because I do not want to disappoint my daughter and have her live with the consequences of my actions if I end it, but I absolutely cannot live like this any longer. What the fuck do I even do? I am so fucking sad. How is it possible to live like this? How has my body not just stopped? What to do",1

"Dear all, \*\*Background information\*\* I was diagnosed with PCOS in November 2019.

The only issue that still persists is weight gain and difficulty losing weight. &amp;#x200B;I have been seeing a psychologist for a few months now and she asked me to show myself to a psychiatrist who has prescribed antidepressants for me. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, high functioning anxiety and depression. (None are due to pcos)&amp;#x200B;I have been prescribed Sertraline 25 mg (Zoloft) and my concern is whether this will because weight gain. I have read both the sides- many books said that they are least likely to because weight gain and help in pcos too by regulating metabolic function of the body and many books said that they can because weight gain. &amp;#x200B;I will be waiting for your responses!

"I want to leave something like a autobiography here, hoping that it will give context to understand how I feel. I also think it will be nice to look back. So, here goes nothing. I am Doa. I was born in a Middle Eastern country 19 years ago. I grew up in a nice small town with my family. My life was pretty ordinary until I realized that I was into feminine stuff, but thought it was a fetish and kept it to myself until 2019. I searched about gender dysphoria, transexual people etc. and I realized that I was possibly a trans woman. I asked my parents to see a psychiatrist, but did not tell the reason since I was not sure. After few appointments, both of us were sure that I was trans. Then, I came out to my parents, which was a disaster. They told me that I was a monster, threatened me with disowning me and stuff. Also, that was a shitty timing because it was my last year on high school and I was going to take an exam to apply universities. As you would expect, I was feeling terrible and got depressed. Thought about killing myself several times and planned it few times but did not do it. By that time, my dysphoria was also killing me and I was running away from mirrors and cameras. After my 18th birthday, things got a little bit better. My parents stopped dealing with me and I found that studying non-stop was a good way to run away from my problems. Few months later, my exam went pretty good and I got accepted to one of the best universities in the country, which gave me hope about life. I was thinking by myself ""okay, what can I lose by fighting a little bit more?"". That was a year ago. In the last year, things got even better I can say. Since my university was progressive, everyone was nice towards me, my parents were fully accepting and I even started to look in mirrors after 1.5 years of misery. Then I got rhinoplasty, completed the preparatory year and here I am. Now you might ask ""What are you complaining about?"". I mean, I feel like I should not complain. Even though that I have not got a feminine haircut and I wear nothing but joggers and hoodies, people call me ""miss"", I am lucky to have a family like that -especially when you consider that I live in Mddle East- and I am enrolled in a good university. My life seems pretty OK compared to LGBTQ+ around me. However, as the title suggests, I just do not know what I want. I focused on my transition too much that I have no idea other than that I want to be seen as how I feel inside. I just feel like lost? I do not know what I want to study. I do not know where I want to live. I do not know what I want to do for a living. Of course there are things that I know that I would like to do or to have. But most of them are unattainable as I cannot change the past. For the future, I just know that I want to be loved by someone who sees me as how I want to see myself, but I could not find anyone who shares the same feelings, thoughts and stuff with me. So, I am here, feeling all alone, living without a goal or anything. I do not want to feel this way. If I could be a different person, I promise you I would. Not because I want to but because that way maybe I could be a happier person. I do not really know what I want nor what to expect from life",0

Its a weird constant cycle where I am either having extreme anxiety or dealing with extreme depression. No matter what I do I can never win something always feels wrong and its exhausting. One of my major ways of coping is through drawing and animating but most of the time I do not even have enough motivation for that these days.

"Look you have to through depression alone and you will never heal. It might sound harsh and inappropiate, but its the bitter truth. There is only one thing you can do against it, make it less important or you try to forget it....Now some of you might think I am crazy, but I am not.1. Remember who you areI did like a list once, where I wrote what I like, who my friends are, who really cares about, my favourite food, what makes me smile, what my name is, when I was born, my dreams, my crushes (trust me it was fun) and many more.... I hope you get what I want to say2. Try to love yourself/ appreciate life or what you have I do that everyday. Whenever I see someone in need I help him and I often help people who do not have money, no shelter, not even a family. It makes me realize how lucky I am and on top of that I feel happier (rather than loving someone who does not appreciate you, yes I was once broken by someone, not only once). What you get from these people is love and it makes you feel better.I even played alot with little kids. They give you attention, affection, love and so many things which you do not realize at first sight, but through experience.3. Find something you are passionate aboutThis one of my favourites... the reason I like it, because it keeps you busy, my goal was to stay busy and try really heal from my pain and this helps you alot....Hit the gym, go playing football, chess, swimming or whatever.... just be busy4.

"I have had lifelong clinical depression. I treat it with medication and therapy, and for the last few months, I have been doing super well! I am actually happy to be alive and look forward to things, which is fun and new. I have been a little out of sorts for the last few days, which I attributed to being on my period. But today I woke up and it just slammed me. Horrible nightmares, could barely get out of bed. Now I feel once more like I am walking through molasses and constantly fighting the urge to cry. What gives? Anyone else had this happen to them? Should I be doing something else? I just feel like I have been catapulted into the middle of a year-long depressive episode with none of the buildup. is not it at least supposed to take me out to dinner first? For context, I have been working through some pretty heavy past trauma in therapy and making great strides. Depression came out of nowhere",0
"I do not have any friends or anything and I am so sad about it. And there was a girl talking to me, telling me that she loves me and all and it made me feel a little bit better. I wanted her to be in my life, I wanted to hug her, kiss her. I thought that she can be my safe haven, my escape from all the madness. But, long story short, she was not very loyal :) And this actually made me feel even worse. I already feel so like a subhuman and imagine, there is a girl I once loved so much and a guy can just, just fuck her if he wants to (I do not think she fucked him yet but I am not sure). Can you fucking imagine how fucking inferior I feel to him? Like, he is stepping on me, laughing at my face and.... I just, it is impossible to describe how it feels. it is awful.But she is everyone I have, I go to her whenever I am sad and want to talk about it. I do not have anyone to seek comfort in, I do not know, I mean yes I know I have to cut her out but I just cannot. I am extremely lonely and I do not know how to cut that one person out of my life",0
"When I was around 10-13 years old, I was very social and made people like me. However, since I left my country at 13 y o I became an outcast. Since the first day of school, I was bullied and made fun of without the ability to defend myself because I did not speak the language of the country I went to. I was so excluded that I had to aimlessly walk in circles in the middle school's playing ground because nobody wanted to talk to me. I felt so awkward. I even followed the other kids in hopes of them including me but I was completely ignored. I was like a ghost to them. Everybody seemed to have fun. It destroyed me to point of shattering my true self-esteem. I endured two years at that middle school then we moved out to another city. At that point, I craved human interaction, was at my ugliest, and started self-harming. Out of nowhere, a girl in my class sees my fresh self-harming scars and tells me that she did the same thing, trying to dissuade me from continuing that practice. We even started chatting on social media trying to ease each other's pain. that is until I told her that I wanted to end it all and that I loved her. She threatened to call the police, which changed my mind. But that destroyed the bond that we developed and, like a dick, I started trying to guilt her into loving me. Things went south and long story short I became known as the depressed, self-harming, crying-in-school kid (teachers knew about the hit that I did). A status that I would not wish on my worst enemies. Fast forward to my first year of high school. I am still a shadow of my former self trying but I thought that I was reformed. Especially after befriending some friends. I acquired a gym membership and even willingly did a speech to my class, at the end of the year talking about how people change, how our class was perfect class accepting of everyone, and being a microcosm that could meticulously project our society. A microcosm where we can find the future: artists, doctors, architects, engineers, and more. Ending the speech with the confession of my love to a girl. Everything seemed going right. ""I am improving,"" I said to myself. Then year 2 comes. The whole year, my ""friends"" and I only talked in school. Rarely texting and we do it is for me being used as a tool for something. I spent all the holidays alone on my pc trying to lie on myself saying things like ""I do not need friends anyway"", ""I am happy"". Sometimes, I unveil my true feelings and start crying by the least trigger such as reading about how much people are having fun in their lives. I hate it when I see people happy. I hate god. I hate my life. I hate the wealthy who can do whatever the fuck they want (and do not fkn tell me how money does not buy happiness because a depressed wealthy person is \*100 better than a poor depressed person) And I certainly would have driven a fkn spear to my heart if it was not for the fact that I am a coward and that my parents have already paid for my college preparation year. GOD BE DAMNED FOR HAVING MADE ME INTO THIS FUCKING UGLY CREATURE WITH NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST TO TORMENT ME. I hate this world",0

I do not leave my room because my computer is only a few feet away from my bed so my days mostly consist of waking up, getting breakfast, playing video games, getting lunch, going to sleep. I binge eat constantly because its the only thing that makes me feel anything and as if it was not already hard enough to socialize with others its even harder when I look like such a fat piece of shit.

I am sorry if this is not the right place but I truly do not know where is. So about a month ago I started to feel down but pushed it off and hoped it would go away and it did not. I feel like I am just getting depressed again and falling into old habits like self harm. But I am noticing I want to hurt others around me and its like picturing how I could and feels like I am having a fight in my head over this and I do not know what the because is. There is also the feeling of never being enough and I have no friends or people who love me which is something I have struggled with in the past. But I have tried talking to my parents as I am 16 and cannot really make those choices about seeking a professional over this or I just do not know how to go about it. I have tried talking to my parents and I have in the past and they never really took it seriously with me and pushed it off as you need to go outside more or off that phone type of stuff but my sister saw people over her anxiety and things like that. But I would just like some advice maybe how to find the because or how to go about this because I am really not sure but I am scared of letting myself go again. I just need some mental health advice,1

"I consider myself emotionally and thus mentally weak. Despite financial success, having a few relationships in my life and other qualities that I do not know even count anymore, even with all the therapy in the world, I will never lose the fact that I am weak. I will ALWAYS have an emotional side that is a hair trigger away from engaging at any point in my life, high or low. Emotions, despite whatever women say are fucking kryptonite to women... Our world is so fucked and we are transforming it so that we cowtow to the less than 1%, inclusivity, equality, men are women and women are men but our biology IS our biology. Men are overwhelmingly attracted to women and vice versa and our biology dictates that no matter how much the powers are trying to fuck with the script, gender roles especially, of how we are to societally be or anecdotes that are raised, SECURITY is something that women will be exclusively disproportionate in needing. You cannot have security in a man that is depressed and is not ALWAYS the rock and could potentially break down at something like the irrational thought of his parents dying and not being around even when they are perfectly healthy.Depressed men = emotionally weak men = do not have a 100% ratio of being the rock, the security = that woman, if applicable, runs away to the candy store of infinite options of men, that will run to her with the snap of the finger and she knows this = man, not fulfilling his biological purpose of reproduction and being attractive to the opposite sex, gets severely depressed and either falls under the rug to remain invisible forever or goes into the dirt.We have to remember that men not being open about emotions, is more than likely it not being societally acceptible for him to do so, rather than it just being ""Me man, me have no emotion. Me strong"". He bottles it and suffers in silence and dies younger. Am I fooling myself in thinking that if I build on all other functions of my life that I will find a woman that will accept depression and weakness or am I doomed to repeat the same sick pattern of women sticking around for a few years and then eventually leaving... *Philosophic thoughts - OPINIONS NEEDED* Is there room for weak men?",0

"I have been getting depressed lately due to some issues with work. If you have ever read about administrative burdens increasing physician burnout during COVID times, it is exactly that. I feel like this is a situation where therapy will not help because it does not change the fact that I have been getting screwed by policy changes and other things I have no control over. I will not get into more about the situation here because it is a long, complex, and specific situation. I have tried everything I can to resolve the issue and manage my own attitudes but I know deep down that until the issue that is contributing to my depression is resolved, I will not feel better.I have kind of hinted at my state of mind to several people and they did not seem to pick up on it, but then one guy did and said I need to get help. Is therapy really going to do anything when the underlying because is still there and I think I am already managing the things I do have control over (including my stress levels and the depression) as well as I possibly can?

But I will not go too deep into it, it is just that my mother and father are divorced, and my mother lives with my grandfather and I live with them too. And my father... well, he does not care at all. He is married for the 3rd time, but the point is he never did care about me. And it is okay. I just have to point this out to clarify why I will not be getting help. But that is not the only reason. there is also the fact that we live in the countryside where there is not psychological help available. So there is that. What kind of advice would you give to someone like me? Can I cure myself? Are there any techniques that may help at least lower my volume of suicidality? Because I know that this is not normal. I have been trying quite a lot of things. Reading all sorts of things to make my outlook on life at least a bit positive. And it did work for a while, I had not felt this way in a while, until that is.. the death of my beloved grandmother.. about 19-20 days ago. But it is not because of her.. well partially. I in general do not have a desire to live or do anything with my life, if anything I would end it. But I am alive for these loved ones beside me. I do not want to make them sad or upset them. I could not imagine them in that much pain. But one of them recently has died and surely that made me feel a certain way. Almost as if death got one step closer. I have subconsciously made up this plan that when my mother dies, I will be committing suicide. Of course, the future is uncertain but that is a plan after all. Anyway, I have been typing for a while now.. If anyone has read this far, thank you. Hope we get better, stranger. Can I cure my mental health if I cannot seek professional help?",0
"They think they can ""snoop"" at me without me noticing. I notice it and they are wrong for thinking I do not notice it and for thinking negatively of me. I take my time speaking because I want to be vulnerable with my problems to them hoping they would understand, instead they misinterpret it with me being dumb. When I first started opening up, my father called me ""crazy"". Now, they think I am ""dumb"". Both are demeaning things to call someone, especially to their own child. it is a shame our parents do not have knowledge about mental health. My parents think I am unaware",1
"Original comment was in French. Shitty translation by me.The problem would first come from people that would be manipulated, and that would go kill themselves because of the pressure coming from an evil-minded entourage. Then, things always end up getting better, and a suicidal person by definition cannot realise that, giving an easy way for someone to kill themselves would necessarily increase suicide rates. Suicide is not a right, it is a selfish act whose consequences are dramatic for the victim's entire entourage, but not for the victim themselves. I have never heard about a suicide that would have made anyone happy, even for the victim, woe will always be better than nothingness.Woe will always be better than nothingness. I cannot explain how those words are straight up cruel. People want you to suffer rather than not existing. Those words are going to stick with me for the longest time. An unwelcome haunting.This is a sick world we live in. I wonder what impact this piece of shit was thinking his bullshit would have on me and other suicidal people. How can you tell that to someone suffering? How insane, how cruel do you have to be?Who are truly the selfish ones? WHO THE FUCK ARE THEY?But this is only a reflection, a foretaste of our entire society. I could never again bring myself to believe, even one second, in anyone's goodwill. Humanity is devoid of such thing. It is only cold and hostile. This is something someone replied to me as I was ranting about how suicide should be a right. This is why we can never talk about our struggles. This is why we can only withdraw into ourselves and die in a hidden corner, like agonising cats.",1
"This is so hard and I feel like I cannot take it anymore...People do not really understand what is like to suffer from depression, how mentally ill people are really having a bad time... its not like those who say ""hm i feel a bit sad today, i am very sleepy, i feel anxious, i want to km, i am so ocd, i have such anger issues"" etc... nah, its way deeper than that... I hate how people glorify mental illness, make it all quirky, excuse iT and they do not even suffer.. we who suffer do not excuse on being a garbage person on our mental illness, that is not how it works ... yeah, they profit off of it, they sprad ""awareness"" about a kid who took his own life but then i go and being honest with my feelings, yeah i know how bad that can feel on the person... but whaT irritates me is that i get called attention seeker, playing a victim card, being blamed for it, lazy, crazy, pathetic and again ""do smth you love"" "" others have it worse or we all have bad days"" etc... i literally feel so bad at nights, i just lie on my bad, i overthink a lot, i do not sleep well, i do not exercise, i do not do anything healthy, i cannot eat well even if i want to, i cannot...i feel so codependent and i feel like people arr just loving it... i feel like i am very capable of making my dreams come true but i feel like i am so trapped and being used as a marionette which affects my health so much... i have anxiety attacks, maybe even panic attacks, its not that i cannot handle ppl around me, its that most of the times they make me feel very anxious after spending time with them... i even self harmed myself and i still sometimes think of doing it, i either feel overwhelmed or very empty and i feel like i want to punch my head against the wall... its not that i do not like people, i want spontenious moments with them(pardon my English), its that i also feel very envious about people sometimes and i do not like it, its that i think i do not like the way people are ordering me how i should feel or act...

"I have already made up my mind. Unless I can switch bodies miraculously I am living on borrowed time. Really, I do not know why I have not killed myself sooner. I am useless and have no achievements but that is not what bugs me. I cannot live with this body. I do not want to do any acceptance self-love crap, I just want to die so I do not have to suffer with this anymore. I am not looking for advice or anything, I am just venting because I have nowhere else to rant off to. I am not depressed either. This is the logical conclusion I have come to that I must end my life. The hardest part right now is finding the right method with the least likelihood of failure and/or mess afterwards. I have already been through a pill overdose which was a shitty attempt but that was two years ago. I am making sure no concerned party calls 911 on me the next time. that is why I am keeping this information from everyone who can stop me. In addition to that, getting 'help' *will* have a worse outcome in my circumstances, believe me. I am already a waste of everyone is resources and my rationale for dying is reinforced through myriad triggers throughout the day. My parents said they would be devastated if something happened to me but I told them that if they really cared about me they would help me find a way to end my suffering for good. They are convinced I just need a med adjustment to feel better but that is not going to fix my gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia. it is all bullshit. The kindest thing someone could do for me right now is point me in the right direction to an easy death that will not traumatize anyone. I am past wanting to get help",1
Really. I always thought this to an extent. But now the one friend I was closest to for years and I supported for years just let us me rot and could not care less how I am feeling or if I died. I am sure this friend will cry and play victim when I die. I never saw this coming and this just confirms that most people are shit. I am still in shock and I am full of hate for this person now. I know that is not serving me anything good but the last 3 years have been so fucking SHIT and I have met so many people who have fucked me over and showed me they do not care about me when I thought they did and when I did care about them. I am so done.Maybe it is fucking cheesy and pathetic but these lyrics speak so much to me now:Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? Fuck people,0

"So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself, because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe- different dress, behaving certain ways, etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself, my personality, values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like, the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more ""pushed our"" into the world, environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am. The etymology of depression means ""to push/press down""",0

Well its not, no one talks to me anymore only my lover, who is wonderful and amazing but just i cannot talk to him about this! Not because anything he does its just humiliating...talking to strangers feels better I do not know why. But i did something awful...i think i know why no one wants to speak with me anymore, I stopped trying to give good advice i just listen ""mhm"" ""well what do you think you should do?"" Hoping they would be able to solve their own issues without needing me! But i realized that just made it seem like i did not care...i do! I just want my friends to grow and learn that they do not need me to make their own choices...but I am too stupid to make it seem that way.

"I often feel the only way to make people take my depression and possible underlying causes seriously is to actually kill myself.

A certain family member is the worst- stating before that I just get a little down sometimes (that phrase still makes me want to punch a wall)or that he notices others inc himself feeling depressed in winter or that he had trouble keeping a job when he was younger. He gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation. That does not solve the problem of the actual job! I am sick of being minimized.I feel (and maybe I am wrong) its just minimizing my condition. I mean hes supportive in other ways. But I am still angry and I feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument I feel, having failed at anything in life the only I can have the final word or any control is to kill my self - successfully. A failed attempt will only make me more of a failure. I mean I know there has to be a better way to deal with this I just do not know how. Confrontation will not help, Ill just sound more desperate. Staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help Ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more. I can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking.

"Obviously enjoyment is a struggle period, but a lot of us can at least remember a time when we enjoyed our personal hobbies, even if it was for a fleeting five minutes every year for years. Be it writing a song, painting a picture, sipping tea with a book, a walk in the park at sunset with no one around, meeting with friends or family, whatever. But collective happiness/enjoyment seems unreachable and I cannot remember a time when I could partake in it. Collective would be such as what is going on now with euro football - people at work talking about it, taking a day off for it, meeting up at the pub to celebrate, getting hyper and rowdy etc. I just think...what is the point? A few rich folk kicking a ball brings millions of people happiness, even though their actions of kicking a ball is so alienated from you as an individual? This could be for anything, so it is not the sport/hobby/rally. Could be the world cup, the Olympics, basically anything that can be a collective. Does anyone feel this way or can express this better? Christmas is another collective I would always felt my depression worsening, because it starts in September in the shops and basically demands a collective celebratory approach as it leads into new year where many countries blast off millions of pounds/dollars/euros into the sky for five minutes of collective enjoyment, when it could be spent on health or education or homelessness, and I would rather celebrate christmas enjoying a day, and only a day for it, with good food and good company.

"It sounds ridiculous -because honestly it is- but I am making a list of pros and cons of taking my life, I am full on serious.

I am both failing and despising my studies (already been held back a year and basically the worst med student you would ever meet), incapable of making relationships or maintaining the old ones, always irritated and impossible to be around. But most importantly I am thinking of doing it for my parents, they have been together for 24 years of absolute hatred and it is just geeting worse recently. They treat me like a third party of their marriage as the oldest daughter which means I am loaded with all their problems while witnessing my dysfunctional family at the same time. My mom always says that if something ever happens to us (her kids) she will finally divorce my father (who absolutely will not do it) and ever since I have been calculating the results. I mean it is kind of of a win for all of us, I will rest, mom will finally get her divorce, my siblings will live for once in a healthy environment, and father will go his own way .. they would be sad for a while i guess, but really that is the only bad side to it.

I want to scream at the world but I do not want to wake the people in the next room since they are the ones letting me live here (probably best to be civil towards them lol).Guess I will just... I do not know. I visited a friend for a night.,0
"Throwaway. Just need to vent.Male/25I have been trying to make music for a living for about ten years now, quit high school to pursue it. Parents not happy, that is putting it lightlyI have now accumulated around 35 million streams on my music, and I barley scrape by month by month. Its fucking hell. When I tell people what I do for a living, I want to die. I am so fuckin sad, lonely and scared.I have no friends left, because I work all the time trying to get this thing going. I have never had any romantic relationships, because of this. I feel like all my music fuckin blows.I have no other skills.I cannot fucking take it any longer, when is it ever enough? When am I enough? When will this pain stop? When will this end?Fuck Wanted to make music my career, but still feel like lm not enough.",1
"I fell so shitty and awful. I had a suicide attempt less than a year ago but it was not that serious, i was not close to dying really, and its made to go crazy. I feel like i have not suffered enough like other people have. I just want to show someone that I am not a coward and that i can do it but I am still to scared. The only thing stopping me is fear. :(",1
For the last few days.It seems that the burn from drinking alcohol is the only thing that feels good to me. Every night its been happening. have not felt this kind of feeling for a long time. Now its starting to come back But day time remember to smile and tell jokes. Make people happy. Hoping it makes me happy in the end. Dark thoughts and alcohol,0
"I do not even know why I am writing this but i need to get this off my chest. I am 21, about to graduate college with very good grades, already have a decent job where everyone seems vey nice and helpful. I have very loving family, i have friends who i talk to almost every day but still even after everything i have i feel empty. I just do not want to exist anymore.it is not that I am sad but that I just can not imagine myself living. I have not tried anything yet but i do not trust myself. I try to keep myself as distracted as possible to stop thinking about it but the moment I am unoccupied I just start thinking about it. I even imagine what the people around me will be like after i die. I do not know when it started exactly but I have been feeling like this for years. In my first year of college i found myself staring down the stairwell ready to just let gravity do the work, then I had a accident in my 2nd year and the only thing i remember feeling during that was relief. I try to live by bargaining for time with my thoughts. I say to myself let us just try living for a week to watch the new episode of a show or let us just wait for that movie to release, or let us just wait until I have visited that place but it is not working anymore. I try thinking that my mom will be sad, my little brother would miss me or my dad will be hurt, but then i think they will get over it after a few years. I have to die someday let us just get it over with. I do not even know why I am like this. I have not told this to anyone. I tried talking to my mom last week but could not. I do not know what to do. I do not know how long i can stop myself. I do not even know why i want to do this. I have not felt happy in la long while, every time i feel happy the emptiness just comes back after a while. Every night i go to sleep dreading waking up in morning. Even now its almost 3 in the morning and i do not want to sleep even though I am tired. I do not know how much longer i can hold out like this. I do not know why I am writing this, i just want to stop. I want to be happy for once, without the permanent anxiety and fear. I want to wake up feeling happy, i do not want to be empty. I want to love someone, anyone. I want to be happy but i feel like i will never be. Please i do not know wat to do i just want to cry but I cannot even do that now. I want to do something i like but i do not like anything. I do not know what i want anymore. Why do i even exist.",1
"Where do I BEGIN. I am 19 year old but I feel like I have already lived for too long. I honestly never planned to make it past 16 yet many suicide attempts later (earlier this year being my worst one) I am still here. It feels like a sick twist of fate. Like I am being kept on earth just for suffering. I am my moms only child and she depends on me for everything. Due to this I constantly have to worry about being employed or else Ill be the reason were homeless. I just completed my first year of college while working two jobs and it was the worst thing that is ever happened to me. I always thought once I ditched the shithole that was high school, Id have a fresh start in college. As you can tell, not true for me. I had the worst breakdowns, falling out with a very close friend and I was sexually harassed by my professor my first semester after he found out I was vulnerable. I bombed my first two semesters of school and I am so scared to tell anyone that I am such a failure. I am a first generation student. I am supposed to be the one in my family that becomes something but I have achieved absolutely nothing. I have just been an imposter acting like I am worth anything. Between the financial stress, mental illness and family issues, I just want everything to stop. I get so worked up because I hide everything all the time but I want to just let go of all the responsibilities. I do not want to be anything or do anything. I just want to die. Maybe there is not a light at the end of the tunnel?",1

"People say suicide is a solution to an temporary problem but that is not always the case. I will never be able to undo the sexual and physical abuse in my childhood. I can spend the rest of my life trying to manage that. I contacted a severe case of HSV from sleeping around (definitely related to the childhood stuff). I can spend the rest of my life trying to manage that. I tried to kill myself with a belt when i was nine. Every day I wish I succeeded. I cannot connect with other people in a way feels meaningful to me. I know other people appreciate my presence because they say so. But when its up to me I spend most of my time alone.It is more selfish for others to force you to stay on this burning, greed driven planet than to end your suffering. Especially as climate and capitalism wreak more havoc we will see an increase. This will not be uncommon anymore My problems are permanent",1
"I mean this in so many different ways. I just feel like I do not contribute much to this world I live in. I do not find myself very interesting anymore. I used to be, I feel like but I think I was just younger and a bit too distracted to notice that all I was doing was copying the people around me. I just sometimes do not know who I really am. I do not have hobbies really and I do not have any talents. I do not even know how to listen to fucken music because I get so overwhelmed with how much music there is! I have lost so many friends because of my mental health and I cannot help but think its because I am not that same fun person I once was. I dropped out of college and I do not see the point in going back because it does not make much of difference money wise or happiness wise. The only reason I would think of ever going back to school would be for the validation but then I remember that nothing matters. But my point is I do not feel like I really add anything to anyone around me. If one were to compare themselves to their siblings I would be losing cuz I dropped out and live at home and now just work a minimum wage job. The thing is I can sort of deal with not having many friends like I once had but I wish I could have a partner but I do not think anyone finds me interesting enough. And it does not help that I am not the most attractive person out there. My future just seems disappointing and lonely. I do not think I would kill myself anytime soon because I know it would hurt a lot of people but if my future keeps looking the same I might have to reevaluate. My city has a popular suicide bridge so I think about it a lot. I was driving on it the other day and I pictured how I would come during the middle of the night and reach the highest point and jump. Despite the spikes that were placed there to prevent people from jumping. But alas for now its just an idea.. I just want to feel like I contribute",1
"Idk what I did. But he deleted me on all social medias. Were long distance so this completely cuts us off. He did not even say why. Idk if he is breaking up with me. He would have told me, right?

26 and I lost my best friend of 15 years. He was the only person I thought cared about me. My ex cheated on me with him and he chose her. She was my first real girlfriend and I put so much into her. Now I have to think about how they are having a wonderful time together and I am completely alone. No one will care when I am gone. I have zero impact on any of the lives I am a part of. Everyone just tolerates me until a replacement shows up. No one will care when I am gone,1
Wow for days I have been worried about this and now that I have less then 24 hours I some how feel good more calm then I have been in a long time I am still scared but I am looking forward to it I will be leaving 2 notes 1 at my house and 1 on my body not saying goodbye to anyone in particular just bye because I the truth is I cut off everyone myself because I knew this time was coming and I did not want anyone to feel hurt because I was dead so for years I have worked on being as alone as possible I thought my parents abused me my mum would constantly tell me how dumb I was and I would burn in hell my dad was a angry person that beat my mum my earliest memory is of him hitting my mum. As my mum would put it years later I would not go to sleep without a beating in other words every night I got a beating for one reason or another. But this all was not true for my brothers at least that is what I believed my school life was bad I am dyslexic af and I used to be the small weak kid so I got bullied constantly really badly to the point teachers joined in on it as well so I got low grades and extra beatings until I got into college where I stopped getting bullied but I was 18 and never had a frienda year and half after that at the age of 20 my dad died that then my mum got depressed so I quit college and started to work 2 jobs to help support my mum and brothers a year and a half after that my mum died that was sad idk why I never liked her so instead of dealing with these emotions I did what my dad told me buried the emotions deep inside they used to boil up in the form of angerI went and got another 2 jobs I was on average sleeping 2-4 hours per night working non stop to support my brothers because that is what was expected of me I got engaged by the age of 23 through some arranged marriage my uncles and auntie set up but a week before the marriage my older brother told me he put me in a ton of debt(almost 100k) so my marriage got called offI had 2 in my account I was 25 by this point I tried to get back on the grind again but I could not my older brother left I could not bring myself to take him to court and over the years everyone told me my older brother was Fing me over even my younger brother was crying saying to me he is Fing you over I did not listen now I cannot look them in the eyes but now both of them have completed university i do not know what they do but they have jobs where you wear a suitI never gave any time to myself it was always about what was expected of me. Yeah I know sounds like a easy life but I feel burnt out always getting kicked down i did grow to be empathetic because nobody showed me any This is my life pathetic human that did nothing in his life and will die at 29 with nothing 24 hours to go my life,1

"I feel really petty and childish for having suicidal thoughts whenever I feel unwanted or forgotten. I feel like I contemplate suicide out of spite. I just want people to remember me, care about me, and actually show it clearly. Just about every year on my birthday I always feel underappreciated. I am mot a remarkable person so I do not expect a huge celebration and to be showered with gifts, but I would like to feel like the people around me actually enjoy my presence instead of telling me happy birthday just because of some push notification or someone else reminded them. Am I really selfish for thinking of killing myself over some bad experiences",1

I am such a loser its fucking pathetic. I did not have friends from kindergarden to probably the 6th grade. Everyone either left me for another friend group or just ignored me after they were done with me. I hate existing but i hate when people pretend i do not exist. Its the worst feeling. Even now i feel like an outsider in my current friend group. I can only enjoy taking to about five or so people but i barely see them. do not give me pity i do not want it The worst feeling is feeling alone,0
i feel like i want to kill myself and do not know what to do.

"I remember hearing about this musician that got up on stage, played an original song called 'Sorry for the Mess' and then shot himself in front of the audience. A politician shot himself on camera right after a press conference because his reputation had been attacked and he thought it would be best for his family if he were dead. Maybe he was right.My older brother had a friend named Ed when I was little. Ed lost his left arm in a motorcycle accident in his early 20s. He dealt with heroin addiction most of his life, until he finally got himself cleaned up. He killed himself with car exhaust a couple years after that.I was told a man in my extended watched his mom set herself on fire to spite him. My parents knew a guy who watched his brother shoot himself in the head; at least that one was an accident.I am going to die someday. I want it to mean something. I can either die in a car accident and go down as a life cut tragically short, or I can pull the trigger myself and leave as one tiny ripple, one more small voice in the back of someone is head saying ""Maybe this life we have built for ourselves is not worth the trouble, maybe we fucked up."" Maybe, if we are lucky, they will actually try to fix it instead of just waiting for something to change. Maybe they will be stronger than me. Sorry for the Mess",1

"god bless the random usernames reddit gives you when you log in with apple. hi. 18(f) here. i just moved to texas after spending all my life in michigan. i grew up in a very odd household. my father introduced me to those adult cartoons at a very young age and my mother was always working. i have three brothers, all older. my oldest is the only one that struggles with his mental illness as well. a little background for whoevers reading.as I am typing this, I am lying on a pull-out bed in my grandmas living room and I am considering walking to my purse to grab my pills and take them all. i cannot do this anymore. my mother and i have always been extremely close so long as my mental health problems are not obvious. it is not as if i think she does not love me. i know she does. i think it has to do with her ex boyfriend. are they exes if they died while you are with them? boyfriend. old boyfriend. whatever. he killed himself after he got a DUI. went home and blew his head off with a shotgun. i do not actually know if his head blew off. always had nightmares about what it would have looked like but i never got to see him. i saw what it did to my mother and i dealt with it first hand. i was in middle school, i think. she shut down entirely. my grandmother is in the hospital and my mother spends most of her time there with her. its selfish of me to be upset over it, i know, but .. again. her and i have always been close. old therapist told me i sought ( seek? ) validation from her. you cut yourself because you want her to notice, you get into fowl moods because you want her to care. i do not exactly think she is wrong. so, anyways. with grandma in the hospital I am home alone. i do not do anything productive, either. i lie here and sometimes i pretend I am in a coma. wake up an hour later to pretend I am just coming out of said coma only to slip back into it again. other times i get so angry i want to stab my leg. i have no one to talk to. my dad thinks I am selfish for even being depressed, my mom and i fight every time i bring up why I am upset, and my brothers just do not get it.I am struggling, obviously. and i do not think i want to die but god, its getting harder and harder to convince myself I have got a purpose. even now, typing this, i feel like a fraud. like being eloquent in a reddit post about suicide means i do not actually want to kill myself. i remember feeling like this as a kid and thinking about how it was something sick i inherited from my family. now it feels like a part of me. an extension, maybe. it mostly feels like god does not, in fact, give his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. it feels like the exact opposite.some advice would be good, i guess. thank you to whoever reads all this. a pathetic cry for help",1
"Hey. I go to UC Davis and it is a decent school and I am proud to be going to college in the first place. However, I completed fucked up my freshman and sophomore years by not attending classes and it is been getting worse and worse every semester and now I failed all 5 of my classes this past semester, and I will probably graduate one year late. My relative is paying for my tuition and I feel really bad wasting one year of tuition money. I have been telling my parents that I am getting straight As in all my classes because my asian parents have pretty high standards.Now this might sound like a very small problem however for the past 12 months I have not gone a single day without worrying and being anxious about this. It is literally crippling me which is why I think why I failed all 5 of my classes this last semester. Half of my waking hours are spent either worrying about my parents finding out or me getting suspended. I cannot get anything done in my life because I have spent literally THOUSANDS of hours worrying about me failing classes, which is ironically a big reason why I am failing my classes - too much worrying. i do not even know why I am writing this but I just do not know who to talk to about this. lying to parents about grades.",0
"Depression taught me that I did not want to actually die. I love this World all the trees, flowers and animals. But I was trying to escape the system and the situation I was trapped in. The only way I could was changing my mind frame, priorities and the way I see this World. Now I live for myself, the animals, trees, oceans, skies, because this Planet gives us an unconditional love everyday and that love is more beautiful and pure than anything and I deserve to be here. I just needed to learn to connect to something that is real and natural. Our relationship with ourselves, the World, nature and the universe is real and that connection starts with gratitude for the life given. The system/society we live in is false and that is what your mind is escaping from. The pressures and burdens of society are not natural and our bodies know it! It put us in a state of depression but do not let it defeat you. Instead become aware and rise like the phoenix. Strip yourself down to the nature of the world, that is how we heal. This world needs you. Nature needs you. You need you. Connect to the unconditional love of the Planet that surrounds you everyday and you realise you will never be alone.

"Several months ago I went through a terrible breakup of a 4-1/2 year relationship. I lost the person that knew more about me than anyone - including my parents. I had to move back in with them, and it was rough. For a few months we tried taking a ""break,"" where I was not allowed to contact her unless it was something we both planned. Right off the bat, she told me that she just wanted to break up but was also curious to see where things went.&amp;#x200B;After two months of listening to all of the fun she was having without me, and her starting to find excuses to back out of everything, I decided it was time to end it. Regretfully it was over the phone, but I do not know if I had a choice because she would agree to meet and back out at the last minute.&amp;#x200B;I was suicidal for a long time after that. Like not eating for several days at a time, looking for any websites with information about how to commit suicide, and even going places to get supplies. I lost about 20 lbs in just over a month because of this. I constantly reminded myself of everything that my ex told me was wrong with me and every mistake I made in the relationship. This was the person who knew me the best, and they thought so terribly of me, so I took it to mean that was who I am.&amp;#x200B;I started going on long, aimless drive to get out and try to find something. Several times I ended up in the city my ex and I had lived in. Our lease did not end for another month, so I stopped by the apartment once after she said she had moved. My head was thinking of all the good memories I had with her there and told me to go, so I did. But actually being there was completely different. She still had random items all over the apartment, and she still had a few of her collages there, but all of my pictures were removed. A letter that I wrote to her shortly after the breakup was laying in a pile of junk mail on the couch.&amp;#x200B;After seeing all of this, I made my first suicide attempt. I tried hanging myself, but I stopped because that shit's uncomfortable. I tried calling a few friends, but they were busy and could not talk. I did not know what to do, so I just drove back to my parent's and locked myself in my room.&amp;#x200B;I decided I might as well do everything that I can to find something in life, so I started traveling. I did a family vacation that went terribly because everything's uncomfortable around my parents now. I visited a few friends, and that was a really good time. I honestly felt great for the first time in a long while.&amp;#x200B;After about a month of that, I found a new apartment in the city where my ex and I lived because I am still going to school there. It was really difficult at first to be here and see all of the places we would go just a few months ago, but that slowly wore off and now it is just mildly difficult. First week I am here, I see my ex pulling into the same parking lot that I am leaving. I decide to go visit a friend to get out of town, and end up running into her mom. Then, two weeks later, I saw her going out with the guy that she said was just a school friend.&amp;#x200B;I was feeling great and not thinking much about suicide, but now it is starting to come back. I have thought about it almost everyday this week. I think about jumping into traffic when I am on a walk, driving my car into the river on my way home, giving myself alcohol poisoning, or just starving myself. But I just do not know anymore. I feel like I have this drive to just keep going and meet someone else and live a dream life, but at the same time I know I am not hard working, smart, or wealthy enough to get any of those dreams. I feel like it would create too much drama, too.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for reading this. I am sorry for how long and rambling it is; I just needed to vent. I do not know what to do anymore",1
"I will make it simple. I have a long distance girlfriend for over 4 years. My family has gone through shit, little sister died very young, dad cheated on my mum etc...I have serious mental issues. No I would not say I am mental but I am struggling with depression, honesty and motivation for years. My girlfriend has always been a support to me but lately she is been more of a mum to me. It turned kind of out of control and we decided to have a 2 week break. I do not trust her as awful as it sounds. I know she will not cheat on me, but I am scared she would find someone better than me, because I know, I am a piece of shit. After 1 week of not talking, I sent her a message, because I could not cope... Now I read and clearly everywhere says, if you go back to the girl before she wants you to, it is messing up everything... So now, it is obvious in a week, she will tell me to fuck off. I cannot face that. I want courage to finish this. All I search on internet gives me suicide hotlines. I do not give a damn shit. I am a loner, no one talks to me, I have no friends and the only person I would talk to is my girlfriend. She told me, ""you know you do this for us, keep strong for 7 more days"".

"I think if I had a gun on hand, Id be able to do it. I fantasize about killing myself everyday. The only thing that keeps my mind off it is moms cigarettes and stolen tequila. I am an object to my loved one. I get so fuckinh drunk I can barely see and we fuck in a car for four hours. And then they tell me they love me and I go home. I do not know who I am anymore, I just want to fucking die. I have nothing. I cannot pick up the guitar or game anymore. I keep having panic attacks. I cannot speak to anyone about it and I do not even want to. I feel like they are just getting in the way of the inevitable. I slept for five hours today in the middle of the day. The exhaustion of not using anything is getting to me. I hate it. I hate living. I want to jump out the window but Id only break something. I have cigarette burns on my legs that I blame on bad ironing. And I am still pretending like its fucking normal, like Ill get out of this, but I will not. I am too far gone. Most of my life has been hatred. I do not see any reason to change anymore. I do not remember what is its like not to think about dying. Its so fucking stupid. I do not want to eat. I do not want anything anymore. 1",1

I feel embarrassed that I am 30 and still suffer with depression. The idea of wanting to hurt or kill myself seems immature and I feel ashamed for feeling it. I feel embarrassed by my mental health when it is bad like this,1

"I want to start this off by saying that I might kill myself or at least I am considering too. I will not kill myself tonight or tomorrow, it is just something that lingers within me.I think about it mostly because I know that I will fail school royally. My teachers do not believe in me, my friends probably do not believe in me either and my mom is lying to herself. I know I am not able to do it because I am genuinely lazy, I promise this is no exaggeration, I really am lazy. I sometimes cannot bring myself to learn even if I wanted toI dread going back to school this summer, I dread living my life even though I have so many things to look forward to in life.Big things like moving out, having a relationship, meeting some internet friends for the first time; but also little things like a third season of my favourite show being announced, video games preordered, going out with friends and everything in between. However, all those things will, in the end, be outweighed by me failing everything.I feel like I reached an end, whether it is the end of my life or something more ""insignificant"" I cannot tell, but it is an end.I do not hate myself that much. I do not think I am depressed either. I am just tired. So, so tired. I am just scared of failing. I am just done with it.I am not prepared for life or any of what is to come. I have considered running away from home but that does not make sense.Nothing makes sense about my situation. I have tried, I swear to God I fucking tried. I would organise my papers and books for school and reflect every evening on what I learned in school but after two weeks or so I would just slowly stop. I tried that method so fucking often but it just does not work.My grades are not bad by any means, they are truly good. So I do not know why I am stressing out like this. This is just me rambling about some shit, none of what I am writing has any form of structure and I am sorry for that.Can anyone please give me advice on how to be a better person? Sorry if what I am saying is not appropriate for this subreddit I just do not know who to talk to. Sorry if my English is bad I am not from an English speaking country. I feel like I am failing.",1
I have decided I am just going to drink this morning. And I do not know if it will end up in me attempting or if I will just wake up at 8 PM feeling like shit end spending another night alone stuck with my thoughts.

"At this point I am done with everything. Yesterday my parents told me that I am going to be homeless in a week. Very likely I am going to get kicked out before then. I have really bad anxiety and depression, to the point to where I am nonfunctional. I have no friends, no relationships with people besides my close family. No job, and I just had to drop out of college in the first week of summer quarter because it is just too much to handle. Life is miserable being depressed and unable to communicate with people. I have tried a lot of different things, and nothing has helped. Except for Xanax. Literally in my entire life the only time I have ever felt normal was on a benzo. I can talk to people normally and calmly while on one. I have had difficulty with it though. I am an addict. In the past I have not been able to take it like a normal medicine. I abused it. Hard. The past few years have been difficult for all of us because of this. Still, it is the only thing that is ever made me feel normal. Recently I made a plan to get some, and I should have more by next week. Long story short, my parents found out, and they are kicking me out. When my mom found out and she absolutely freaked. She changed the wifi password and cancelled my government subsidized phone plan (which nobody else in the house has any use for, because they already have paid for phone plans). I will not be able survive homeless. Let alone homeless without a phone. Life is miserable enough as is, add homelessness and it is pure hell. I have wanted to die for a while now but have never been willing to go all the way until just yesterday. My mental health is honestly way too terrible to be homeless. I do not know what to do. I am out of options. Life is too much of a struggle already for this. As soon as I am physically out of the house, I am going to pick up a few fentanyl pills, go out into the woods and take them while already on a ton of benzos. it will be just like going to sleep. Peaceful. Parents kicking me out, I am done",1
"I have always gotten good grades because all the learning kind of came easy to me but ALSO I believed that if I got bad grades I would be grounded/some punishment. And I really did not notice it until school was online because of COVID. My school friends did not transport well into the new lifestyle so I was now conversing on my phone with new people that were not in my area. The grade anxiety did not completely show up then until my brother got multiple bad grades. The actual story was, he was not turning in the homework because he had done it during zoom class and so the teacher did not give him points. But the way I heard the story was, he got bad grades and he was now grounded. No phone, no YouTube, no nothing without permission. So getting bad grades would mean I would get my phone taken away. So I would not get to talk with my friends or anything and I already had trust issues. With past friendships breaking from different things, I really needed friendships and getting my phone taken away would not help anything.So my warped little mind pressured me into believing that If I get **one** bad grade, we will be in deep *trouble* Wooooooooo Grades",0
I am so scared to fall asleep because my mind wonders for that 15 minutes of trying to fall asleep before I actually do. I hate hearing my thoughts. They are so mean to me. They tell me I am ugly and fat. They tell me I need to do more. They tell me I should not be this tired I am not even doing enough. I wish I could be held like a child again. When was the last time I was truly happy? I am so tired but I cannot sleep,0
"This year has been the worst ever in my life. eLearning has changed my life in the worst way possible. I am even more introverted than I was previously. Back in April, one of my close friends was even diagnosed with depression. In February and March, my teachers were punishing us for our bad behavior even though I was not part of the group of people who caused them. In May, one of my teachers called me a politician who lies because I was running for Student Council President in my school. How come I respect others yet I do not get the respect back? I have felt depressed and lonely since the beginning of this year and I am losing hope in the future. Making new friends is impossible since my parents get mad when I make online friends because apparently all of them are pedos and that they will kidnap me or something. Covid has not helped either. My friends are like Things will get better but after hearing that many times, things 100% have not gotten any better. Why do I deserve this? What have I done to deserve being depressed? If I died, everyone would care for like a week, then everyone will have forgotten my existence. do not have an easy way to kill myself either. Maybe drowning or no water could work. Honestly, if I could choose the option of killing myself without any pain, then I would choose that. Why continue suffering through this pain any longer? Why is my life going downhill?",1

"I just want to die, life is not for me. I remember a time when I was younger and I was happy being alive but that time is over. The reasons to stay alive have slowly dwindled into an empty void absent of hope. I cannot find meaning, I cannot find passion, and I cannot find love. I am not horribly ugly or socially inept or have an illness that causes me pain, there is not anything ""wrong"" with me I just do not have the right thoughts that make being alive worth the energy. There are a couple of conditions that could change and I would be fine with living, but the painful reality that I do not have the ability to create these conditions is becoming more apparent as time goes on. Maybe this will change as I get older, maybe it will not, but we all die one day, and I am fucking tired so why cannot I just end it here. There is not anything that makes me want to get up in the morning so the only reason I do it is the fact that killing myself would leave my family with immeasureable pain, and if suicide was seen differently I would be able to cease my suffering without hurting the people I am closest to, just let me die for fucks sake why must I continue to exist. I wish people did not make such a big ""thing"" out of killing yourself and you could just do it whenever",0

I take adhd medication.I am probably also on the autism spectrum, but I do not have the money to figure that out.I am an intelligent being that cannot actuate potential and get through the mental roadblocks everywhere and explaining that to someone just leads to them thinking I am lazy. If being so mentally broken that you cannot do some basic things is laziness, then yes I am lazy. I am not really suicidal in the way that like, I do not enjoy life.

"tl;dr: I am doing better, my friends are so proud of me, I finally believe in myself and I see a bright future in front of me. My family does not. They keep insinuating that I will not ever get better and that I am lazy and will not do anything with my life. How do I not go back to the dark place I was?A month ago was the first time I had felt genuine joy since 5th grade. After so many years of suicidal thoughts and apathy towards my life and future I started to have plans for my future, I started to think about studying languages, I started to say no, I finally was standing up for myself.I now know I can do whatever I want to do. I now know I have friends that love me as much as I love them, and they are so happy that I am doing better, that I hang out with them, they are proud of me. And my therapists have also told me that I am clearly doing better, and they are also happy for me.I feel like I am rediscovering life, without this dark veil that was covering my face because of my past and my family. Speaking of family, unlike my friends I feel like they do not trust me to move on and have my own life, they demoralize me and I just feel like I am going backwards on my progress when I am back home (I live with them). They keep saying things like ""you have to work, you have to study blablabla"" ""what if you start acting like before"" in a very condescending and negative manner, as if I was the lazy useless person I thought I was for all these years. And whenever I talk about doing things with my life they are always like ""yeah but if you want to do those things you have to start working otherwise you are not going to do anything"", like, I know all those things, they do not need to constantly repeat that all the time.They do not believe in me and I am scared that I might go back to where I was. Does anyone know what I am talking about? I do not know if any advise can be given but that would be cool. After almost a decade I am finally doing better.

I cannot be taken for granted anymore, I cannot be treated like this anymore, I cannot be a fucking punching bag for the people I love anymore... I do not have it in me anymore its over I cannot fucking do it!! I want to fucking die.. I do not see a way forward I do not see the point anymore. I am so full of anger there is so much I want to say to certain people in my life but I am too scared of what they will do or say to me. They would not physically harm me, but the things they say, the isolation then after it, I am already so lonely if I say how much they fucking hurt me they will either ignore me for days or not see me for weeks and I cannot handle that!! I have already been so alone through all the lock downs for the 14 months.. I do not know how to let them say the horrible shit they do and just take it on the chin. I used to lash back. I used to fight back, but now I am broken. I will end up fully alone if I fight back anymore, If I stand up for myself I will end up alone with my thoughts. My thoughts will be the end of me. I will have to remember all the trauma that is happened in the past. I will be alone with nothing to take my mind off it.. But if I stay quiet then I will not be alone and ill get to escape this pain, for another kind of pain. Only.. I do not know which is worse anymore. I feel invisible... No one actually knows just HOW much they hurt me with the things they say. Now I want to hide from the people I love most because they make me hate myself more than I already do. The worst part is.. They have not said anything to me that I have not already said to myself... No one hates me more than I do.. But hearing them also say the things I have said to myself?? Well I guess I had a sliver of hope that it was not that way. But it is. The only way I will make it is if I disconnect... I have started already and I think people are starting to notice, they say things like ""oh I wish you could talk to me about how you are feeling, it is a shame you cannot vent to me.."" but what do they honestly fucking expect.. They have seen how unhappy I am, when I say how I feel they fight with me over it!!!!! I do not know why I am writing this.. I do not want attention, I do not want to seem like I am an attention seeker, but I guess this feels like a diary.. I know this is all over the place, I am just saying what is in my head at this point. I can say what I feel and no one knows who I am. No one will ever know. Jesus fucking christ I do not think I can do this anymore....",0
"I need to say some stuff. I do not need anyone to fix me. I just need people to hear me so that I know I am real. I am 42 next month and I struggle with depression and occasional hypo-mania. It has wreaked havoc on my life. I had some trauma as a very young teen that i was not even able to process until just a year or two ago. I started using drugs when i was a teen. I got clean at 22 and worked really really hard to rebuild my life. I graduated from Arizona State with a 4.0 perfect gpa in marketing in 2005. I took a dream job in Minnesota. But I knew nobody there. It was cold and gray. The depression came back and for the first time i started to feel the pain of lonliness. I went through a period of rapid cycling moods: Id be so depressed I could not move for days at a time. Then id feel great and think I am going to do big things. I thought i wanted to start a candy company and raise a million dollars etc. Eventually it all became too much and i quit my once in a million job and moved home to AZ. I ended up losing everything and starting over at zero. I rebuilt a career in behavioral health, lost everything, built a successful business selling modems. I made one million dollars in sales in 2013. Declared bankruptcy in 2014. The depressuin comes and wipes everything out. I rebuild. It happens again. A year ago, i had a good corporate job. I owned a house that was $38,000 from paid off. Somehow through a series of starry eyed confidence of hypo mania and excrutiating lows of depression i ended up selling my house, losing the money, losing my job. Also, i should note that i became addicted to narcotics in 2012 after an accident. It happens with the depression. Drugs. Because i literslly cannot stand the pain and its numbness or death. But i fought back. I got clean in July 2014 on my own. It took me several years but i pulled myself together, got back to a job, etc. Once again, i was at zero, less than that actually. I built up again. But when i quit drugs i also left my circle of acquaintances. And i never quite got a footing in my new life. It took me 3 years just to be recovered enough to function in society. And last February was the time. I started getting out. I went on a couole dates. I had decided to *look* for my future. Then COVID came. Lost my job and was not able to get unemployment because i quit my job due to severe depression. I lost my house. I tried to invest and screwed that up. Now I am staying at my moms. I have nothing and nobkdy. My work history is spotty. My marketing degree is from before social media. I have no remarkable skills despite being intelligent. I make terrible decisions. I do not know what to do. I do not have a single foothold, nothing to leverage. I literally know nobody but my mother. The lonliness is so bad i have sat in my room scresming crying because it hurts so bad. Physically. Its worse than any pbysical agony I have ever felt. Its like my soul is being suffocated. I do not beling to any groups. I am not christian and do not feel comfortable in chruches. I do not know anybody. I have no job, no job skills, no money, no savings, no plan, no confidence, no hope. I feel like the tree in the forest that falls and nobody hears it. Did it make a noise? Did it even fall? Did it even exist? If i dissapeared tomorrow, other than my mother the world would not notice. I am outside of society. I am nothing. I often start to question if i even really exist because no part of the world sees me. I do not want to die. I am not going to kill myself. But i wake up every day amd think dammit. Dammit! I have to do this again. I have been crying most the day for a week or two. I am terrified. If something happened to my mom id be on the streets. This is not supposed to be my life. I hate it. Every mome t i wosh i would dissapear because i cannot do it. I do not want to rebuild again. I do not want to do it because its so painful and hard and every time it just goes away anyways. I have never been able to reach stability i my life. I have hurt people around me so much. I feel like i only am a burden and a dissapointment. I have never had a healthy relationship or one lasting longer thhan a couple months. Since i was burt as a teen and the house i grew up in i never had love modeled for me. I do not know what it means, how to give it, recognize it, or receive it. I have spent 30 years just wishing so much for a shoulder rub. Sometimes i go months without a hug or touching a person. I am dying from lonliness. And from lack of hope. My teeth are bad. I had planned to use money from selling my hosue for dental inplants but the money is gone. I am not sure i could even get a job with them like they are. I certainly cannot date. And i cannot fix them. I do not even have money to have the ones rotting in my gums pulled. I see no path. I am without hope. And so lonely it fucking feels like cruel torture. I do not want to kill myself. I do not want to die. But i feel like I am slready dead and it hurts like watching a child die. All of my hopes and dreams for my future. I cannot. I cannot I do not know what to do or where to start. I have nothing and nobody and i just want to have never happened. A tree falls...",0

I have a shit husband who only takes me from granted, 2 kids who do not even care when I am not around, no friends still, just coworkers who love that i make their lives easier. a bunch of people only interested in me because of my face and body, but not in my personality. a bunch of other people who just ghosted me, never even told me what i did wrong. i have meds that do not work because they fix my brain but not the problem with everyone else's. i have a foster dog, two kittens, two rabbits, and they would all be better off without me. cliche, i know, not caring though. no one else cares, so why should i? i could just take a bunch of pills at once and wait for my heart to stop. i was going to end it on my 18th birthday",1
"When I was younger I knew my mother was unstable. I do not blame her because she married my father knowing that he is an alcoholic who smokes weed constantly and never helps out around the household. They treated my brother normally since he is the first born but still he is low contact because of the instability of the household. For example, screaming matches and me stepping between them and me being the ""peacemaker"" and praising me for it. Not being able to use the bathroom at night, which led to some serious issues. But now I have horrible depression. Everone treats me normally now since I am an adult, and even everyone is normal and happy in a way. But it is just the trauma from my childhood still lingers and it makes me so depressed. I even developed my father's alcoholic tendencies, and my mother's ability to not handle any kind of stress without breaking down. I am failing most of my classes, but cannot tell them because last time I told them I failed one class they almost drove me to the point of driving me to the brink with mental abuse and other horrific languages. I just do not know what to do about it anymore since I am at the point where I am in between and cannot tell anyone. Called all the hotlines, talked to groups where I lived. Just depressed. Treated horribly as a child but better now? Still have serious depression.",0
"I have been on a steady decline for a couple months now and I am thinkin I am at my stop. I tried to get better and get help, changed my meds, added meds, but I am all out of juice. I do not have much to live for. I am living alone in my apartment with no job on my 5th year if college. I am in a major I am too late to back out of and hate very much. I have isolated myself from the world and only go outside to get weed or groceries. Otherwise I am playing video games and avoiding my online class and feeling incredibly guilty for not having a job like all my peers. Its anxiety inducing to the point of breakdown to even think about doing interviews. I know, please do not judge me. 98% of my days in the past few months I have had no social interaction whatsoever besides texting my only friend who has now given up on me. She told me i need I need more help than she can give. I get it. But she is been writing off my emotions for a while now anyways so its not surprising I guess. The isolation has killed me. I have lost a lot of ability to socially interact. I know I can be stable. In I highschool I played sports and was friends with half my class. I was able to function and even hold relationships. I am diagnosed bipolar but its ramped up gears 10 fold since freshman year of college. I liked to go birdwatching. I liked to go camping. I liked being around people. I liked playing video games with my friends. Its sad I miss that the most. I still find a little joy in playing team games to get at least a little social interaction. But I have none of that left now thanks to this disease. so what is the point? I do not think there is one anymore. If I kill myself the only ones who would know are my parents who have never supported me emotionally or took mental health seriously. I do not even have anyone to say goodbye to i think I am close to the end",1

"Guess should start of saying if you check my short post history I have obviously not went through with it yet. Although I have it currently planned out a lot better so I will go peacefully even if I kind of feel that would not be good for a part of the reason I want to go.Every day I am trying to further justify having no guilt wanting to kill myself. The latest reason is why do I have to emotionally suffer the death of my parents from old age/health issues? it is really not something I want to deal with (among many other aspects of life, some being a part of life bullshit, some my own doing), yet here I am born into this with only one true choice.There is lots of mentions of killing yourself is selfish, why? Surely it is just as selfish to produce a life and let it suffer at all the bullshit life has to offer? Or are people that want kids just delusional in some way? Have these people just never had any problems or just wilfully ignorant at what bringing a living thing into this world actually means? Why is producing life okay but having the choice to ending it not?",1
"time for you guys to listen to my meaningless ramble. I am 18, and meant to be graduating high school in a year, except i will not be because my grades are too low and i do not care enough to actually try studying, which is strange considering my academics used to be the pride of my life. i failed at life this year. i do not know what happened. i see my life falling apart, i see myself binge eating multiple times a day, which must be great because i had anorexia a decade ago which still seems relevant to my parents and hopefully when high school ends ill off myself. i have no hopes or dreams. i can never get out of bed. i see everyone around me, breathing, laughing, eating. i have felt suffocated for a long time. my head is empty all of the time- i used to be able to think, to do stuff. now there is nothing to fill me. I am just a retard. i do not want any sympathy but i am. i do not know why but i always feel disgust when i see people doing anything. plus--i got a fake diagnosis of autism just because of my intense physical hatred of social situations. i got a fake diagnosis of depression because I have been burnt out a long time. also I am really slow. when will anythingg be real. i struggle to see the consequences of my actions. every day repeats- a cell. i hate life, but i carrrrry on. i fucking hate my crippled ass. i have never been out of my parents sight my entire life, yet they still treat me as a ticking time bomb. i can never be bothered to respond to my needs. what is the point of a point. I am done with this shit---but i realise that because today is the full moon which is erlevant to ny parents which means i can be dismissed. i hate myself goddammit. i suck at everything every day. there is just no point in my being. i profit off other people, and worst part is i cannot off myself or cut myself or slit my wrists properly,. someday it will be done. i just cannot be bothered and i have no correct equipment. everyone is more successful than me, and i do not need a pat on the back. thanksyall for wasting your time to read dis shit. master of pathetic idleness",0
"Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY. I just never feel enough, be it in my family, my friendships, or my relationship. Whatever I do, I can never be good enough. At this point, I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy, all I remember is feeling sad, that is IT, THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings, I hate getting attached, I hate trusting someone, I have my mother, I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate, but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me. I lost myself and I cannot seem to find her again. It just does not get fucking easy, it is just torture. why am I never good enough?",0

"so I am 20 yr old and I have a 24 yr old sister and my father is pretty strict. I mean he is strict in general with all three of us (me , my brother and sister) and i understand that it is bc he is trying to protect as from the unfairness and corruption that is in the world. but he is extra strict on my sister especially since she is a girl. for example he does not allow her to go out with her friends even though they are only girls because he thinks that girls should not go out alone since he does not trust the people and what will they do. also having a boyfriend is outside of the question and he does not care if he makes a scene outside of the house when something is wrong and because of all of this she lost a lot of her friends and started being lonely and depressed.now if I am being fair to him my grandparents was twice as strict and he was treated much harsher than us since that was the mentality back in the 60s/70s and that was just he was raised. and amid all of this I try to help all I can and I always hear her out whenever she needs to in addition I always try to convince her to talk to him but she refused the idea and said that she will resent me forever if I ever talked to him behind her back and I think she is being serious about it. so now I am in a difficult position where I cannot do anything but watch as her hatred grows each day while having nothing to do to stop it. and it is starting to eat me up inside bc I do not want my family to fall apart. hell my hands are shaking typing this just from the idea of what could happen if we do not solve this problem.so as conclusion. if anyone has any tips then please help me...I am starting to lose my shit here.**0 CommentsShareEdit PostSaveHide** I a 24 yr sister with a parent that is strict on her that she started developing depression bc of that and began claiming that she does not have a father. what should i do to help?",0

"Without too much details i tried twice, one was meh, second was pretty close, i was hospitalized for 2 weeks and got out with just complications with my intestines. Last one was on december, when my only reason that made me postpone it left me for after 8,5 years. I was engaged and she left. When i talked to my shrink, after i did it, about it we were discussing how others, how my shrink, how my friends would think and feel. That is one of the main reason why i have chosen a few methods that will not damage the surface. Because i know my parents would like to see my body. I am 34, just bought a house where i was supposed to live with my wife but like i said she left. I am thinking of leaving the house and whatever inside to her. I am still making the house the dream home i wanted us to live in and when it is done, i am gone (it rhymes :D)I am just thinking of ways to make it better for the ones left behind. My friends, family, maybe a few coworkers. I want them to understand why i do it, what i felt, why it has been my purpose for about 8-9 years and the reasons why i just postponed. I have an okay house, meh job, good friends, awesome, beyond awesome 3 cats. But waking up, eating, sleeping, working, thinking, doing literally anything is just too much. I do not have anything to expect, anything to live for (i really want to see the diablo 2 resurrected though but most likely i will not)I am thinking of personalized, unlisted, scheduled youtube videos for my friends, maybe playlists, about how i feel daily, my happy moments etc like personal vlogs so when i am gone they can watch those and at least try to understand what was going on with me (i know they will not, they will blame themselves probably why they were not there for me but actually they do not even know.) if i have 1 good quality of mine, i can distract and hide stuff well. At least that is what i think. So any suggestions? What shall i leave for them to make it slightly better and easier to acknowledge that it has nothing to do with them but me and i am quite happy, or at least accepted the results, with my choice? How would you make it better for the ones who left behind?",1

"Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself.

One was for a job I honestly did not want and the other was for a job with the college I got my master's degree from.

"My life feels to be falling apart. I do not know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. I do not have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I am wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I have tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. I cannot figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I did not recognize as I have gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I do not care to talk about anything I am interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just do not care and I do not want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. I do not care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I am just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it does not feel as...there? It feels like I am wearing emotion-canceling headphones. it is all still there, but it is so muted. I cannot stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...I have lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just do not care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I do not care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I have already failed, I still fail. So what... My motivation was already shit but now it is more like I do not care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just do not give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it is still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I do not feel the anger at myself as much. Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. it is Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I do not care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. that is literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I do not want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist. I do not want to kill myself, I just do not want to exist",0

Analysis paralysis is real. Is anyone like this? I am already in such a dark place and this constant ruminating over the past I cannot even describe how heavy this is for me. Has anyone managed this? Or something. What is/has been your experience with ruminating? It leaves me paralyzed and panicking I do not know I wish it would all stop. Its like time travel would be the only way to fix this. I cannot stop ruminating,0

"Just reread this post and it is a little over the place, but it is late and I want to go to sleep so I will just post it like this.Even as a little kid I did not have interests. My mom used to get me to try different hobbies but I did not like any of them. Maybe that was an early sign of what was to come.it is sad to see someone as young as me not doing anything other than going to school and to the gym. By the way, I have not seen any progress in my body for years now despite lifting often, I just cannot bring myself to eat 3000 calories a day because I do not have discipline. I have only gotten physically stronger, so I guess I am the skinny guy lifting comically high weight at the gym. And while I am lifting, I am thinking of how I do not enjoy doing it.I just do not feel joy from doing anything. I have not been happy since I was a child, and even then I had my dark times. it is a shame, my parents have spent a lot of time, effort and money on me. So far, I have managed to stay alive for them.let us talk about friends, shall we? I do not have many.I live in a small city of around 150000 people. It seems like everybody knows each other except for me. Every time I go out with the little friends I have (who are, I believe, catching on to the fact that I only like hanging out when there is alcohol involved) they greet so many people, and I am the dumbass that is just standing there being sad.I do want to get better, but I am in 4th year of secondary school (11th grade) and I think it may be too late to start building a personality. I am just a she will without interests or hobbies. I guess I can be kind of funny when I am drunk, so that is why my friends keep me around.I am the only virgin in my friend group, which can get horribly depressing sometimes. I play it as a byproduct of being gay in a small city, but it is really just because I have no social skills and I do not enjoy being alive. I have never had any hobbies or interests. I know no one outside of school. How do I build a personality?",0

"I have been having suicidal thoughts ever since i was like in 5th grade or so because i felt like a burden on my family, friends and just generally anyone I have interacted with. I have had a really hard time with talking to people too, and everyone in my family judges me for it. They are not wrong in doing so but a lot of the times i physically cannot open my mouth and speak. I got a girlfriend around my freshman year in highschool and despite that the thoughts did not go away. I really was happy at times and imagined us living together after getting married and that, but a few years later we broke up. Even though she said she did not want to get married I think she is lying to me. She told me that she did not want to get into any relationships until a few years later, only to get into one about a week later. This and other incidents of her lying to me made me more sad than i ever had been. Compounding all those other reasons i felt that those years we were together were all a lie which sucks when she could have been the person to pull me out of wanting to kill myself. The suicidal thoughts have gotten to the point to where I am almost always thinking about gruesome ways in which i can kill myself or be killed by others. I have even slipped up and asked my ex to kill me in a begging kind of way. I told her ""Kill me"" over and over to her face and I am ashamed of having done that. The thing is, despite all of this I have only cried once in about 3 years and I am certain of that. It was when my ex and I broke up. I do not know why or how this happened but i cannot cry anymore no matter how hard i try. I hurt myself physically and mentally and nothing seems to do it. Every thought becomes more and more bloody and that and i even picture my familys reaction to it; nothing. I have become obsessed with trying to make myself cry and i even draw a hypothetical of what my suicide might look like. I will not be killing myself anytime soon because I am Catholic and do not want my family to feel bad; the whole shtick. But has anyone else not been able to cry or can you relate to any of this? I cannot talk about this to anyone else but i have some anonymity on here so i felt safe in posting this. Thank you. I cannot cry anymore.",1

"Hey, so I have posted a few places for support but no community has given me any so I am trying here.Backstory: I have always struggles with depression and intrusive thought usually brought on by my father who is verbally abusive. He likes turning anything good to something negative. About me: I am 20 this year and studying, I moved out of parent's place and was doing so good until Covid decided to make us poor so I had to go back to my parents. I have been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.All my colleagues always call me floaty because I am happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. Here I get to the point:My family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. I was really worried about my dad coming home because he is always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice, modest man who is grateful for everything. This however lasted only a week and once again everything in my home is cold and dark. We had a party and one of the guests accidentally packed his phone in when leaving. My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.Today nobody in the house is talking, everything is tense.I am just depressed and disappointed. I have been crying and nothing is happy anymore. The whole situation just completely through me of while I had been stable and happy till now.We have an apartment by the beach where I want to flee since I can still have online class from there and my workplace allows me to travel since we serve the whole country so I can go there and still work and study without any additional moving or trouble Problem is that our country has some limits on traveling between states right now, however the apartment there is on my name and I could say I am going home.Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health. What would you do in this situation? External Factors harming recovery",0

I just ask for advice from people who have been through this before.. the desperately wanting of at least a panic attack. Please excuse my grammar mistakes. Wanting to suffer",0

I keep having these repetitive suicidal thoughts but I have no desire to act on them.

"My boyfriend of a year just broke up with me a few days ago. He has depression and I pushed him away. I did and said everything wrong. A few months ago he had a large depressive episode. He did not want to hurt or burden me, so he tried to break up with me to isolate from everybody. I told him I will not let him be alone. I stayed and emotionally supported him, and he was happy I cared to stay.I did not realize that my daddy issues surfaced in the relationship. I needed healing for my inner child regarding insecurities and feelings of being worthy. When these needs were not met, I kept pushing him away, complaining, fighting, criticizing him.My bf tried to fix me, he felt guilty that he could not. He tried to heal me, lift my confidence up, he was like my therapist a lot of times. He tried so hard to make me happy by actions not words. I did not appreciate this. All my stupid mind wanted to hear was words from him because that was my mental issue I needed fixing. Nothing he did was enough for me, I desperately acted out every time he did not reassure me. I told the poor guy that he was hurting me and I could not take it. I blamed him that he did not do enough,and he was crushed. He loved me so much he stayed longer than he should have. He said he hung on by a thread for a while but could not take it. The past few months he felt guilty he hurt me. He also took a while to break up with me because he did not want to hurt me and break my heart. He said were not compatible, which I know is untrue because we would be perfect if I had worked on my issues, we are like best friends. He said I should find someone to love me right because he clearly failed. Now he is so stressed out with his job and his health, he is crumbling into pieces that he almost died. He broke up with me last week and told me to take some time to heal myself. I begged him not to break up for a while and he held on but now he begged me to let him go. He said hell still be here for me but as a friend and that he cares about me a lot. We are not talking right now. I feel tremendous guilt. He is at his lowest right now. I am going into therapy to fix my issues. How do I fix this ? I will clearly not try to win him back right now, but I want to be supporting him. Should I do no contact for a month and then reach out and ask how hes doing? How do I reconnect and support him emotionally? I feel like $hit. what words can i say to make him believe I am sorry my boyfriend has depression and I did everything wrong",0
"it is much more complicated than the title, but the short version is that I have lost the desire to do anything in life.I am 28, unemployed and still living with my parents. I graduated from a career I came to hate the more time I spent in college, but did not have the guts to quit when it was time, so now I am stuck with it. Pursuing another major is out of the question. I have no money for that and, most importantly, I do not know what else I would like to study. Anything that once appealed to me just does not, anymore.I have been diagnosed with depression in the past and my therapist did help me through many things. I was younger and wanted to see what could become of me if I actually fought for myself. Now, all that is gone.I hate myself. I hit and insult myself almost daily. I know I need help, professional help, but I do not want it. I know something has to change, but I do not want to.I have thought about this for years, now, and no matter how hard I try, I just cannot find anything to live for. I do not have any goals or objectives, or passions. Even my hobbies seem nothing but mechanical. I cannot find a job and, even if I could and knowing that I have to, if nothing else, to at least have money to live, I do not want to. I know what I am good at, but I do not have any desire of doing that either.I do not want to try. I do not want to fight. I do not want to live.there is two reasons why I have not killed myself. First, I do not want to hurt the people who I know care for me. Second, ultimately I am a coward and cannot bring myself to do it. Maybe that is a good thing.I know my mindset is wrong, but I honestly have no desire of changing. I do not even know what I could do to help myself. Any goals and ambitions I can think of seem pointless. I do not know what would make me happy anymore.What is the point of living if I cannot find a reason to do it?What do I do? I know I need help. I just do not want it.",0

"I have had maybe two girls in my life tell me I am attractive. Sometimes I believe them, but most of the time I do not. It should be fairly obvious that you are attractive when you are attractive.

I do not get how people take good photos of themselves, and I think how shit I look compared to them is making me realize that I really might be disgusting looking... no matter how good I look in more ""professional"" photos taken with DSLRs. I also feel this way every time after I shave lmao. Idk I am probably coming across as a psychopath which I may or may not be.

"It just hurts. To live, it hurts. To remind of all the good things I have lost and will never come back to me.I have been abandoned by the person I held the closest to my heart, and I cannot see any other reason to keep on fighting this disgusting life I am left with. Things will never get better: only worse. There is just way too much going downhill in my existence, and I do not have the strength to make a change or kickstart my life from the miserable, broken condition I am in now. I am trying. I am fucking trying. I have never spent so much time talking to other people, trying as hard as I can to keep my mind occupied. I am speaking with a therapist, but nothing's helping me to get over this. I am not even sure if I WANT to get over this.And when I am alone, in the darkness of my bedroom, memories keep hammering me over and over with many contrasting feelings. Nostalgia, remorse, hatred, want, frustration, love.Love.I know it is serious when I constantly keep thinking about how much would it hurt to slice my wrists open. Or when I constantly feel like writing one last message, for every person that I loved.I am not sure I can endure this. I just woke up crying and thought about ending myself.",0
"I am reaching out, from afar, can you see me? I am calling out, pull me in, I need a place for healing. I dream of tomorrow, where did it go? Its the same as always now. Breathing out, breathing in, a chore of suffering. Calling out, to the dark, I hear nothing calling back. Thinking of snow, cold and frozen, memories of hot coco walks. Memories gone, torn apart, I feel the dead beat called a pulse. where is my hope? where did it go? To tomorrow. But I live in the same day over and over again. Tomorrow does not come, hope is gone, I hold on to all I know. I need to know, where did she go? What did she do that I could not? Favourite child, calling out, got whatever she could want. Tossed aside, just be quiet, you are not here to make a sound. Memories gone, torn apart, breathing slowly starts to thin. I need to hold on, but for what? I search low and high to find the purpose to all the hell I have wondered. Nowhere found, beating heart is booming all around. Scared to death, but not of death, its been here since all I know. what is it like, to be free, to be wanted and believed? Hold me close, do not let go, they are softly whispering. Unnamed",0

"If I believed in some type of a joyful eternal afterlife, I might be able to guess that any resilience evidenced within this earthly lifetime would ultimately be rewarded to a way more intense degree than any I could imagine inside my simple, small intellect. I just impulsively checked for some relevant data online and found out that there might be something like over 2 billion Christians on earth.But as it remains, I believe that possibly nothing special happens to us after we die. Following death, there is just immediate darkness, silence, numbness -- nothing. The experience of death is akin to the experience of deep dreamless sleep.I can vividly remember how incredibly purposeful my life felt during childhood, when I was thoroughly religious and believed that everything I was doing was being gleefully monitored by a loving God (or maybe multiple gods) who wanted the best for me and other humans. But as the years passed and I encountered more and more unanswered / blatantly ignored prayers, I grew to express some minimal amount of basic skepticism toward the idea that any deity loves us or actively participates in our lives.While I will not get specific about my problems within this post, I will just mention in passing that I have almost certainly suffered much more than at least 80% of my generation's peers. And as my suffering has gotten worse across time, I have come to reach a point at which I have found no higher purpose to my suffering -- there is no probable reward one faces for continuing to deal with severe, crippling, life-ruining depression.Laughable as this may seem, I used to believe that continued suffering would result in the cultivation of continued wisdom, almost as if the reward for ongoing pain was to become a goldmine of hard-won insights which could (one day) easily wrest a fresh interlocutor out of fairly deep suffering via pithily expressed wisdom. But now all I deal with each day is a sort of ... numb resignation before a potentially premature end to life.What am I supposed to do if I can realistically expect sporadically increasing suffering in my near and continued future? In the absence of religious belief, there seems to be no way to derive any sense of meaning or fulfillment from a life of serious and potentially mind-destroying suffering.Life feels like it is losing its meaning with each passing day. Does my suffering have no higher purpose?",1

I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other ""elite"" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as ""normal-acting"" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TL;DR: Years of abandonment, avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is self-fulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS.: There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine, but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant. [CW: Suicide] Why I might commit suicide very soon, advice and consultation welcome!",0
Today I was supposed to get my marks but I ended running away. I was planning to hang myself in another building but there are no means. I am in it atm. Any tips on what should I do? My father got my marks and they are all zeros... I want to die. Advice?,1
I am done. i genuinly feel like my life is finished. I have tried living but its just too hard. I am so ready to kill myself,1
"I know I have alot to do, but I know I am going to run out of steam as soon as I even imagine getting started n so I am just laying here with no action n my brain telling me I should be doing stuff. it is a crappy in between of not being productive but not relaxing either. Procrastinating??",0
"I have been experiencing depression for quite some time now. I used to have a group of friends who i can call every week, but things have changed and I have not been in contact with them for half a year now. My remaining 3 friends got tired of me ranting about my life. Whenever I seek advice or help, i feel like I am bothering them. I also used to talk to my bestfriend every single day for 2 years. We had feelings for each other, but we are not together. I am not sure if she is avoiding me because she is currently dating someone and does not want me to get involved. The thing is, i really want to reach out to her, as my bestfriend, and keep talking to her everyday. I miss her ""how are you""s, fast replies, and midnight talks, but I cannot. I feel like I am forcing her. kind of clingy. i might bother her. and she might thought I want to pursue her. I am the hulk and she is my black widow, my comfort and peace.its really hard to wake up, eat, and shower everyday while carrying a heavy heart. i do not know what to do and i cannot take this anymore. Quarantine hits",0
"I keep jumping back and forth between wanting to die and wanting to keep going or keep trying. I do not know where to begin so I guess I will just spill my thoughts until I feel as though I have written enough. No one gets it. No one believes that I would actually do it, including me sometimes... I want to make the world better, I want to make the people in my life better... but I know that is just me trying to control others, which is something I know deep down is wrong. So, the alternative to acceptance of my circumstances, often seems nice. I took my mom in almost two years ago... both her parents died in 2014, and the fight over what little inheritance there was to fight over caused her to become estranged from her four sisters. She has not spoken to them since, and neither have I. All this happened a year after my 2013 sobriety date (I am a recovering heroin addict). I took her in because she had debted herself into a hole she could not crawl out of. I am 28 years old, 8 years sober and was 7 years deep into a career as a restaurant manager when covid hit. I did not get laid off right away, in fact I kept going at my job until It was demanded of me that I move to a location that was a 3 hour commute from my home. My company did not give me any other options, and so I told them no, and thankfully qualified for unemployment. I probably should have just sucked it up and done the drive every day but I was depressed, my car was barely making it to work as it is and I already hated restaurant management so I ended the relationship so to speak. My mom told me it would be 4 months until she got back on her feet and could afford to rent a room on her own, its now been almost two years. She, of course, used covid as an excuse to prolong her comfort. I wish people could understand how difficult it has been to deal with her, the shittiest version of her that has ever lived. She is awful. She cuts me down at every turn, manipulates me into considering that I am a bad son for even suggesting that she should leave my home. I wanted a family, kids, I was even lucky enough to find a girl who did not mind that my mother was living with me. Sam is great... but my mother has even come between her and I and started arguments that would have otherwise not happened. she is lazy, she is depressed and I find myself brought down to a degree of insanity that I never thought possible, especially while sober; and a similarly depressed state. Obviously, I am depressed. I want to have a purpose. I am smart, able-bodied, and ready as ever to affect change onto the world but I do not have a good outlet for it. Maybe I do... I have recorded a few different videos for youtube on various topics, they are all really good and I know that deep down, but I just cannot bring myself to post them. When I look back on my life, my childhood especially, I realize that critiques were easy to find, where praise was absent. And I know that, because of this, my self-esteem really holds me back from doing all the things I want to do, but even knowing that, I just cannot seem to surmount my fear of failure... or ridicule. I think I just need compliments or someone to tell me everything is going to be alright or someone to tell me to chase my dreams because I am beautiful or some stupid bullshit like that. I need someone to support me that is not me... I wish I had that. I am getting angry. I would never hurt anyone that was not myself, and that, at least, is something I can take pride in... that no matter how angry I got at the world, my default setting would because me to simply leave it, rather than attempt to destroy it. I wish I was not born into a world where a dad would rather take exotic trips every week than help out his son who is taking care of the woman he abandoned. I wish I was born into a world where good ideas and awesome people were celebrated and encouraged rather than torn down at every juncture possible. I wish I was born into a world where there were no examples of ""men who died before their time"". I wish the world were different. But it is not my world. So, as Ghandi instructed I will try my best to be the change I want to see in the world, and pray that it becomes better before I can gather the courage to leave it. If you are feeling hopeless like me, all I can say is... I hope one day I have the opportunity to appreciate you... I will not be offing myself today. Conski I never thought I would feel like this",1
"Hello.I think I am in bit of dark place in my life, and I think it shows when I am at work. People do not really care about me, and mainly it is because I do not fit well in the group, and its dynamic. they are just not my kind of people, but I act mostly happy, and I do almost whatever people ask me to do, because that is what good colleagues do, right?But last Sunday we had a talk after work with a couple of beers (I work in a restaurant, so there is booze around), and one of them suggested the girls would rank the boys on looks, and on character, and the boys did do too vice versa. Anyways, I ended dead last of the men on the whole spectrum, and it made me feel uncomfortable. I mean, the question to begin with was cringe-worthy to begin with.Anyways, there is more going on with my life that does not fit well in my life, but I like to keep that private, if you do not mind.Anyways, but how do you hide your depression for others? Are you a great ""actor"", or does it show? What are your tactics/moves/tips?I am not willing to go with antidepressants, because I am going to, it takes your soul away. No offense.I am glad to say I have the best girlfriend I can imagine, and I got great friends, so there is that. But at work it just is not that great (plus the other personal shit I am going through).I am just curious in how you cope with feeling really down, or downright depressed, and how you are successfully showing it to the world like there is nothing going on.I hope I did not annoyed, or insulted, any of you with this question and message. If you are depressed, how well can you hide it from the outside world?",0
I went and tried to get help for my suicidal thoughts at a and e and after waiting crying in a chair for 6 hours and me telling them I wanted to try hang myself again they told me to go home and rest.I am so confused. Why will not anyone help me? I am trying so hard.They say go get help do not give in - but when I go for help I am turned away. I feel like I am just going to break. hopeless,1
Sorry the title pretty much says it all. I finally fell asleep at about 1am because I was absolutely exhausted but I had this really morbid nightmare and woke up at 2:50. It was graphic as hell and really disturbing -- I was too scared to fall asleep again so now I am shattered. The worst part was waking up in a cold sweat and desperately longing for my ex. I just wanted to cling to them and sob. I was terrified and they are the first place my mind went to. I do not think they will ever understand how much they meant to me and how willing I was to stick around when things got hard. I just wanted them. I think this might have pushed me a little further so. Idk if I am going to survive the week at this rate. I do not see a point in living. Really disturbing nightmare,1
"For half of my life I have dealt with depression. I think its at the worst its ever been for me and I have no clue what to do. I see a therapist virtually, but I am not sure how much its really helping.I miss people, I miss going to the store without worrying about getting sick. So now I just never leave the house. I am not even happy in the house. Its messy and unclean, I am sad and have no energy or motivation. I am anxious far too often. I try to keep positive that it will get better but its taking ages. I feel jealous of people sometimes because they seem beautiful and healthy and happy. I was not like that before and of course you never know what people are dealing with. But, I just want that happiness and health as well. Instead I hate myself and basically have no friends.Will it get better? I sure fucking hope so. I just wish I could disappear. Feel so cold and alone and overwhelmed",0
"Everyone has their own lives and it is dumb of me to expect people to remember when they have said they will do something for me....but is it really that bad of me to expect people to remember me? I asked my roommate last week if he would drive me to a biopsy I had this morning, and he had come back super late the night before and was asleep when I needed him. My sister who has been helping me with my car payments had said she would be able to help me with the payment today, and we even talked about it yesterday and still, she forgot. I hate being a burden and I hate asking for help, so even ASKING these things of them is so fucking hard in the first place....having to remind them is even worse. I ended up just driving myself to my biopsy because I did not want to bother my roommate by asking him if it was still OK. I do not want to bother my sister about the money even though the payment will bounce and I will be charged an extra 100 in late fees because of it. Its literally so humiliating asking for help, especially when it comes to money, and reminding people that they said they would help is even worse. I really think I would just be better off letting the cancer take its course so I do not have to bother anyone anymore. I really really REALLY hate this. I wish people remembered me",0
"No offence to whoever says or believes this but I find this really upsetting, triggering and just some overall bullshit thing to say to someone I HATE WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME I am UNGRATEFUL FOR BEING DEPRESSED because A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEALTHY AS I AM RIGHT NOW",0
"it is a shame low quality things are made available to me. When I complain, they would say that I am ungrateful. My only choice is to suffer. People do not realize that they can change. No wonder people do not improve. I want to leave this family and this country. Untitled",1
"So I got a notification that someone followed me on reddit. Turns out my boyfriend or whatever he is, commented on my posts that I had made months back. I was and still am struggling so fucking hard, he does not understand the daily fight to not end my own life. He says he feels trapped, that he does not want to be with me because he is burnt out. that is fine, my life right now is shit. My baby brother is missing, I practically have no relationship with my two kids with my ex, I have severe ptsd, he does not want me anymore, I am a horrible mother... I guess I just want to die, I am not wanted, I am not needed, and worst of all, I am not loved. No matter what I do, I lose. I cannot handle all of this anymore, I want to die. I truly feel that the world would be a better place without me in it. My kids and him deserve better than I could ever hope to be. I am such a fucking failure, I want to die. To get up every day knowing that no one on this earth wants you around or alive is fucking soul crushing. I have been cutting lately because of how I feel, people do not love me or care about me so why should I maintain self harm sobriety? No one cares if I cut myself. No one. Not even him. At this point I do not know what is stopping me from taking my own life... God I want to fucking die. I want to die",1
Nobody cares about me. there is no way I can contribute anything to society why cannot I just quit I have no business being alive wtf,1
"Like, exactly title. I am just done, I do not care for anything and I want to end it. This may be painful to read but nothing in my life gives me pleasure anymore apart from small things that have nothing to do with me. Its like I fucked myself over w/o even knowing about it. I need something to live for but I cannot find it, please help me. I feel like I cannot anymore",0
Please help me. I just cannot fucking deal with it anymore,1
"I cannot believe that only such a small amount of people of all people on earth are depressed. This number is not right is it? ""&gt;264,000,000 people of 7,800,000,000 people worldwide suffer from depression"" - Is the amount really that small?",0
"My sister got married recently, and as many of us with depression may do when we attend a wedding, I have been ruminating on my life and proximity to my (hopefully) future wedding and coming out more sour than sweet. And the biggest punch in the gut is not that I have not found the right partner, but rather that I do not have a group of friends to make the day special with. I was my sister's maid of honor, and she had such a beautiful group of bridesmaids to spend the week with leading up to her wedding, who have been her friends for quite some time. And she and her partner had so many wedding guests to invite (even with a Covid-safe ceremony) that made the day feel so special. I am happy for her, but I have to admit I am also jealous. My depression has turned me into a recluse, and I struggle to name people who are close enough friends to stand by me at the alter on my wedding day, and how many people do I really know who would be excited to attend my wedding as guests?I know that weddings do not have to be huge ceremonies to be special, but I struggle to think of even a small group of people who would happily show up for me. Unfortunately many people in my family are toxic, and I do not have close friends, so thinking about my future wedding guest list is so stressful. What if I end up with a partner who wants to invite lots of people, and I have almost no one to invite? How sad will that be? I feel so pathetic. The hardest part of a wedding",0
"My life has no meaning and while that used to give me comfort and a sense of freedom, it does not do that anymore. I cannot think of a good reason why to carry on living, it is just torture, and i try to lie to myself that its worth it but deep down i know that it is just a way for me to rationalize my crippling fear of death. At this moment that is the only thing that is stopping me. I do not want to die, i just do not want to be alive anymore. I cannot find a good reason other than the fear of death to continue living",1

I wrote letters to the ones that matter most to me, but its difficult for me to go on. I have forced those around me to watch me slowly deteriorate. Losing pieces of the thing that makes a person alive everyday at a rapid rate. My heart is beyond weak, I am going to do some self care and then do the ultimate self care. I no longer feel like a burden because no one has to worry anymore. Everyone take care of yourselves and hug your loved ones. today",1

"I went to residential for 2 weeks and it was amazingly helpful. It did so much to change my outlook on things. While I was gone, my wife realized she can not keep doing this. I spent all of my momentum coming out of residential on convincing her to at least give us a chance. I was able to get a job, only one place even reached out after I applied. It is physically wrecking my body. I am in pain every day. The pay is crap. Plus I am sleeping in the guest room which has a shitty mattress. I do not know if I can make it through this. I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass, unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our, sorry *her* room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table, that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it, I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work. I can not even work up enough to care. Falling Again",0
"My mood swings affect me so much. I would not say i fluctuate between happy and depressed, but rather neutral calm and suicidal anxiety. It seems weird to even put it that way considering I used to be incredibly hyperactive. But nowadays, perhaps due to the landscape of covid19 and the incompetent handling of the situation by the Government, adding on to the fact i have nothing going on much in my life (which i may stress may be due to the lack of motivation from these mood fluctuations too). I know it is not good to put the blame on your mental health but it does have a part to play. Currently i am seeking mental health treatment in my school counselling program, with an upcoming one this Wednesday. These depressed feelings usually hit when i am alone or at home. I do not particularly enjoy being at home. Coping slowly",0
"I do not know what I did wrong. She never admits it but I know she does not care about me anymore. I do not know what to do, she was the one reason I had to live and now she is not there anymore. She knows how much it hurts for me and how suicidal I am and she just ignores me. I wish I was never born I had a friend but now I am all alone once again",0
"I am very sick and tired, both mentally and physically. I have been struggling with a lot of physical health issues for my whole life, and I have been struggling with mental health issues for the past 6-7 years, I am so tired of having to deal with both problems, as my physical health makes my mental health worse and the stress from my mental health is likely just making my conditions worse, its a never ending cycle and I rarely feel good, ever. I have been struggling with severe asthma for my whole life, which is fine on its own, but its at the point where I have a hard time doing much exercise, and I can no longer cope with weather changes, so every time it rains a lot of it becomes a bit more dry than normal I find myself heaving for air and coughing up blood. I am writing this right after contemplating taking my own life and coughing up more blood into my sink. My asthma is not all, I have a lot of trouble eating food, I randomly get very sick after eating and I cannot seem to link it to any specific type of food, so almost every day after eating a meal I am in pain for hours. I have a hard time sleeping, I have barely gotten any sleep the last few months, and when I do sleep I sleep almost the whole day, and I cannot get out of bed to do anything, its very frustrating. As for my mental health, I have not been able to seek any professional health for a lot of reasons, so whatever I say about my mental health is not diagnosed, but all I know is that I NEED to see a professional soon, I cannot handle my own thoughts anymore and it sucks. I have been struggling with really severe depression since I was about 11-ish, and the earliest suicide attempt I can remember was over the summer after I had completed 6th grade, I had not been eating for a few days and I was just extremely sad. I have had a few attempts before, usually I am too tired or scared to fully go through with it, which sometimes when I am having a good day I feel grateful for not going through with, but usually I just remember my past attempts and feel an overwhelming urge to try again. I also have really extreme anxiety, and it is exhausting. My anxiety is just crippling me and it kind of rules my life to a large degree, as I do not ever get close to many people, and I am too scared to just act how I want to act around peers and even friends. Speaking of, I do not ever speak to any of my friends outside of when I am physically around them, and I never see them on my own time simply because I have no energy to see anyone and I do not live near most of my friends, which is sad since I only have like a handful of people I would call friends, and I am not close to them by any means beyond friendly engagements. My experience with schooling also makes me extremely depressed constantly. When I was in middle school a few years back I was constantly bullied for a lot of things: my poor social skills, being nerdy and kind of awkward, being annoying, and acting ""like a fag"" (this particularly hurts now because I am gay). I would get my books thrown at me, people punched me and once there was a boy about twice my size who made remarks that he was going to rape and beat me up in the school bathroom, and then followed me around the school with his friends. I tried to do sports, I played football (my dad wanted me to try it out, I never liked sports at all anyways) and this made my have a mental breakdown every day we had a game, and when it was not game day, people would bully me in the locker room. The boy that threatened to hurt me in the school bathroom got paired with me to practice tackle drills, and instead of doing it how we were instructed, he would pick me up and slam me into the ground repeatedly, which was not how our coach told us to do it, and it hurt my back and made me shake and cry after practice. In high school, I joined the swim team, as I loved swimming and I was actually very good at it, and on top of that it was the only sport I was able to do without worsening my asthma, which was great. But the massive pressure I had on me to do well in an extremely competitive swim team made me constantly anxious, and I cannot even enjoy going to the pool anymore. I got picked on by my swim mates as well, because I was not very well socially adjusted, and I would get insulted in the locker room for being a little weird. Our soon to become team captain was kind to me and told me not to listen to them after school, but that really did not help much. My family is not really much better: my dad is never home so I do not even know him as much as I wish I could. My biological dad is somewhere in Europe, and he stopped even trying to talk to me anymore when I was 10 years old. My adopted dad is alright, but he is kind of cold and does not really show affection in a way that I understand, although I know he cares for me. My mom had a bad childhood, so she has a lot of problems that I have to step around constantly. I ask them to take me to a professional of some sort, and up until a few months ago they would just play down my mental issues and coupled with my really bad anxiety I was too anxious to actually say anything. I started telling them I had very frequent suicidal thoughts, and this I think really scared both my mom and dad and so they kind of lashed out, I do not think they know what to do. My dad told me that killing myself would be a selfish thing and I just told him to fuck off if that is what he wants to tell me, and my mom told me she would get me help but always is too busy/forgets to schedule me an appointment. I feel like I am trapped in a box and I am invisible to my own family most of the time. A few years ago I started having obtrusive thoughts that ranged from random urges to harm myself, many of which I acted on, to thoughts that my family secretly hates me. This past year was awful for me. I am an at risk group for Covid and the whole pandemic thing just took a massive toll on my already declining mental health. Being in my house was not bad for me thankfully, I am kind of used to being alone, but the frankly idiotic and terrible response to it by my local and national government made me a lot more nihilistic than I already was. I had a heavy school workload, I have always been considered ""gifted"" so most of my classes are pretty intensive and doing them online was terrible. I sacrificed my sleep for A's and B's and my dad still was not satisfied, which made our relationship even worse as I was so tired I just told him to shut up. My parents argue a lot as well, sometimes my dad yells at me for no reason and my mom yells at my dad, and it is almost constant. I have also lost faith in my parents being competent role caretakers in any way. They argue like children, and its almost always over me as well. I already lost one dad and I do not want to lose another, I wish I could fucking die in an accident so my family could stop having to argue, or pay for my medical treatment. I have little to no energy to do anything that could take my mind off of my problems either, I just lay in bed all day and zone out while watching YT videos that I do not really want to watch anyways. I am also worried my teachers think I am ""special"" or something, I cannot really engage in social situations that well and I think I might have autism, as some of my relatives have it and it would kind of explain my lack of social function. But my parents will not take me to see anyone anyways, so why should I even care? Sometimes I wonder if I am being neglected by family, I would consult my counselor but my anxiety stops me from really speaking to anyone about it because I am scared it will turn out my parents are abusing me mentally and I do not think they are bad people, they just have a lot of their own issues and they are frankly just silly people in their own right. I do not know what to do, I am kind of hoping that my health issues will just kill me already, I do not think I am going to get any better, my asthma is only getting worse to the point that my doctors are assessing if my lungs even work properly at all, and I also might need to get the inside of my stomach looked at because my doctors could not find out why my body freaks out whenever I eat, which scares me. I do not know if I am going to live a long life, and all I want is to have my problems go away. I hate where I live as well, I cannot stand it at all, and I cannot move currently due to a multitude of reasons. I want to just die already because living this way for almost a decade now has just destroyed me as a person, I feel sick inside and I have no one to really talk to about it, I have some online friends who are very kind to me, but I get panic attacks and I feel extremely ill whenever I open up about my issues to someone I know. I do not know what to do, I keep remembering instances where I attempted suicide and its overwhelming me all the time. I cannot even use sleep as an escape. I hate my life. I am sick and tired",1
"I just want to go. Some days feel like I am making progress but then I see something that makes me remember the kind of pain I inflected in the person I love the most in this world, and I just want to fucking die. I did not do these things on purpose, but they happened and I am not being given a second chance to make them right.My tarotist (yeah, yeah, I know) told me that I would be doing alright by January next year but I do not see it coming. I do not see my 22 years on this Earth. I had the best birthday by her side last year and knowing she will not be in this one, I want to peel off my skin, get infected by the environment and drop dead.Yesterday was the last drop, she is hanging out with her ex and some other friends of hers. Her ex does not live near so I am assuming they are staying in her house. I know the girl I love is having a hard time, due to having to hide from her family about her sexual orientation while she is already struggling with trying to become independent and getting out of her toxic household environment. it is hard for her but I wish she would seek out some comfort in me too, but in our situation it is understandable why she does not.She sent a final letter through the app we met telling that she could not be friends with me and to not look out for her, but I am weak as hell. I want to know about her life and see that she is doing well.And yeah, she also played her role into not making the relationship work out but, while I am trying to be logical about it, she is dealing with a lot right now. But I felt so bad in a given situation that, instead of helping out and making her feel at ease, I put my problems on top of hers and that cracked her up. She feels that she cannot trust me, I wished she would see the progresses I have made so far but I feel like it does not even matter anymore. The promises I made her, I could not live up to them when the moment most needed it.I was dealing with a lot of unresolved issues when I went to her hometown, and I feel like shit because I made promises with the extroverted version of myself in mind, but that 'me' had been sleeping/dead for over a year (this pandemic sucked out all my social skills, fucking hell). I could not project myself in the way I knew I had in myself some time ago, I was not ready.I am trying to do better but I want to be seen by her. I never liked the idea of living just for myself, filling myself up with projects that mean little to nothing by the time I go to bed, it is exhausting.We talked about getting married, her coming to my college graduation, moving in with each other, we even made bets in relation to our future kids together. I feel empty as fuck and I cannot take it anymore. she is so beautiful, virtues and flaws, and I was so fucking stupid of making her feel like she should change things about herself when she is already perfect in my eyes, well, perfectly imperfect really. I always set high expectations for myself (me never feeling enough and some other thing related to my family relationships) and I put those same expectations on her, without realizing that those made me feel awful as well.do not go on and tell me ""there are plenty of other fish in the sea"". I do not fucking care about being romantic with anyone else, it makes me sick to even think about it.When she talks even concrete walls fall in love with her, she is that kind of person, and I took her for granted.I do not think I am going to make it to the next year. While I am not alone and I have a better relationship with my parents and some others, they will never be enough. I am in my hometown right now, staying at my dad's. I even told my psychologist about my suicide plan like a month ago. I know they did everything in their power to help me get out of this mental state but that is it, while I do appreciate them for what they tried to do. But now I just want to die in an accident because I cannot do it on my own and maybe it is better, my family will not know that I intentionally put myself through that anyway. At least I will be a donnor and somebody else will get a chance to live a life they want.I feel so fucking stupid and angry at myself.there are a lot of other things missing here but the post is long enough already. If you made it this far, thank you, you are kind, or just bored, heck if I know.Good luck and take care of your loved ones, do not ever take them for granted, do not be like me. I want to die and stop breathing life into my body",1
"Lots of things have been building up recently and are making me feel like shit. I struggle to cry properly, I do not know what it is I just cannot. I feel like that is the best way to relieve sadness but I cannot do it that way. This causes me to want to harm myself and I followed through with it. So how can I release and feel better in a healthy way? How do i release sadness in a healthy way",0
"I think I am better off dead because I am diabetic, have hypothyroidism, and autistic. There is no place for me to be accepted in society, especially in the employment world, because I have nothing marketable to offer, and my limitations far exceed my talents, which I doubt I have. I am sick of not being acknowledged, recognized, or heard for my good qualities. The sad reality is that society will never automatically see what is good about me. People are far too judgmental, and I cannot take rejection much longer. No place for me",1

"I am trying so hard not to give into these negative thoughts. I know nobody can help me. I moved to start a new life and it has been nothing but bullshit. I was staying with someone up here but they stole from me so I am literally living in my car while I wait for my first paycheck. I do not even have a place to shower or bathe. I know some people have it much worse, but I cannot go back home because my family is not my family. I am processing so much and feel horrible. I watched someone I know have a miscarriage last week and it is burned into my mind. I have faith in a higher power but I do not know what to do anymore. I do not have any family to talk to and all my friends have screwed me over. I cannot help that I am different. I feel like a alien in this world. I have made mistakes in my past but I try every day to make the world a better place and it does not matter. Nobody cares. I do not want to keep living this life, but I have to because suicide is a sin. I am just so emotionally and mentally tired and it is scary because I came here to follow my dream, and now I am homeless with things stolen from me and living in my car for at least 3 more weeks, as a single woman. I am exhausted because I cannot get a good night's rest, strangers I meet treat me horribly, and I had to cut out pretty much everyone from my life. I feel lost, and just exhausted. I do not see the point anymore. The world does not want people like me",1
"When my dad tested positive for Covid after he was vaccinated with Astrazeneca, my life took a turn. He had to be brought to the hopsital and stayed there for 2 weeks. While we were there, we found out he was going to be homeless, not one of his relatives were willing to help us, I begged that he stayed at (his moms house where he grew up, but now its owned by his sister who is in the states) in a year or 2 until I could stand on my own (broken family, did not finish college, still starting my small food shop and living as a caretaker for my boyfriend's uncles house. In addition to all that, I also tested positive FOR THE SECOND TIME with covid. My dad needs insulin and I will have to pay for a new place to stay, food everyday, and his medication, (100$ every two weeks)... in the next 3 months (until the government provides free insulin, it will be 50$ less) I really felt alone and felt like I was the only one who loved my dad. My family knows I grew up without him with me, without him supporting me as I struggled thru life, though they might think that he deserved what he is going thru, I do not. I am just his kid that he did not abandoned when I was 8. I am 25 now and still trying to get my life together. As much as I would like to take him with me, I am staying 10hrs away from him for my shop here in a bigger City, I cannot pay for it. Now I know people who are willing to listen to me, but I do not want to burden them with a problem that money can solve... I have to move fast, I have to find a way. I have to not give up. But some days, I feel otherwise. And it is scaring me because all this love might not be enough for me to keep going. I am weak. And I want to escape this. I used to be just contented with going slow in earning money, but this time, it is urgent. I do not know what else to do. I easily get triggered whenever I see people collecting cash for non-life threatening situations and get tempted to ask help, is this my pride? I do not know. I just know that I am desperate and scared. ever felt like ur mental struggle is not valid becs what is causing it is financial issues",1

I guess Ill feel safe in my sleep but its effecting me there too. I cannot stop thinking about everyone around me now ignoring me, leaving me. Being abandoned it hurts knowing no one is near me when I wake up. I no longer feel comfortable in my own bed, but I am just trying to take care of her. But I am scared they are all no longer wanting me in their lives. I am just trying to help myself but nothing is working anymore I want to tell her this but I am afraid to be honest, I am scared my darkness will stray her away.

"I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since is was 8 years old. To be honest its all because of my abusive parents. A few hours ago they were cursing my name, hitting/punching me and spitting at me. They say that I am the reason of their misery and that they hate their lifes because of me. I am a 15 year old girl who tries her best in achieving everything they ask me to do. I hate my life because of my parents. Nothing is ever good enough and I think a lot about ending my life. I told my friend about my thoughts but she did not care. I wish somebody understood me and helped me through this without judging me. The worst thing is that I am always smiling and hiding my pain. I want to make people laugh and smile, that is my only source of happiness. I wish someone could make me happy and genuinely smile without thinking about suicide. I hope I will attend that day. My only wish is to be free, happy and never have to remember this pain. Suicidal thoughts on a daily base",1
"I fell in love with this girl, I have not opened up about my feelings about her already.I do not want to.She far younger than me. I am 28 and she is 21. She has friends and dreams, while I am a rotting husk of a human being. No actual talents, only issues and self hatred. I feel the love between us could be anything but a good relationship. I never experienced a woman's love. I have been hurt so many times by people around me I find it difficult to open myself up.I only have sensitivity and some sort of empathy, which most of the times, is so overwhelming I have to shut it from the inside and repress it. I want her to be happy, I want to see her smile and listen to her laugh. My presence can only poison her soul. I fear, once she gets to know me, all these beautiful traits will fade, like a painting left under the rain. She truly deserves to be happy, alone or with someone else. She deserves better.",1
"Background: I have had depression and anxiety for ten years. Particularly bad episode this last month. About a year ago I came very close to taking my own life and recently have been back on drinking and taking pills to numb pain. Have also been self harming.My doctor surgery has a policy that to make an appointment you have to call at 8:30 in the morning and they will give you and appointment for that same day. Have been ringing them for weeks but the phone line is always busy. Rang them outside of the 8:30 window and told them I have been trying to make an appointment for weeks, that my mental health is severely deteriorating and I need to speak to my doctor as soon as possible. They said they cannot offer me an appointment unless I call at 8:30am (in the past, I have managed to get appointments outside of this time if its urgent but the woman on the phone was not being helpful). She said to go online and fill out a form. I did, and specified that I am feeling suicidal. They said someone would come back to me within a few days. A week passed and I did not hear back so I emailed them to complain and asked why my mental health is not being taken seriously. They did not respond and still have not. My therapist told me she does not know what else she can do for me and she thinks I need to see a psychiatrist and she will write a referral letter. I asked her when it would be ready and she said in a day or two. did not hear anything back from her after a few days so emailed her and she said she forgot to clarify, that she was going away for ten days and so would do the letter when she returns.Contacted my private healthcare and spoke to the doctor there (did not call them initially because my NHS GP has all my medical history and was the one who started me on my medication). She prescribed antidepressants. The system on the private healthcare app glitches so the prescription was pending and had not been sent to the pharmacy so I cannot pick up the medication. Will take days or weeks to resolve this, as this has happened in the past. Even if I do get the antidepressants they will take weeks to kick in.Called private healthcare again and asked for a direct referral to a psychiatrist. They authorised it but out of the five psychiatrists I contacted for a consultation, all either did not come back to me or told me they are not taking on new patients. All the effort to keep calling doctors and writing emails is more than I can bear as I am not eating at all and am paralysed from the depression. So the fact that I am trying and getting nowhere is really defeating.Last night I had severe panic attacks on a busy street, to a point where people were asking what I had taken because I was so paranoid and was not in my right mind. I had not taken drugs, I was just having a nervous breakdown. I could not breathe for HOURS because the panic attacks were constant, one after another. At least four strangers called an ambulance but the ambulance said they will not come because they are too busy.Today, I called NHS 111 and was spent the whole day speaking to various agents who would take me through the same set of questions each time. No help. Just passed me around from doctors to mental health services with no outcome. Finally, a doctor told me she made an appointment for me at the urgent care centre. I told her I did not have the strength to leave the house but she urged me to go, due to my state. Got to the hospital and they have no record of my appointment and so the nurse booked me in as crying for no reason. I was in such a state I could hardly speak but I did say I was having panic attacks all day so not sure why she trivialised it. She said the wait time is over two hours so I was back to being surrounded by strangers while continuing to have uncontrollable panic attacks. I left the hospital because I felt too sick/exposed to stay there in that room for two hours. Called NHS 111 again and had to go through the same questions that I had already had to answer five times today. Told the guy on the phone that I have been trying to get help for weeks and no one will help me and all he kept saying is do you feel your symptoms are getting worse since you last called us. What else am I supposed to say to them? I have been struggling to breathe for 18 hours straight, to a point where my throat is raw from where I have been gasping for air. I have expressed over and over that I am feeling suicidal. I hung up because I realise I was going round in an endless circle.There is nowhere else for me to turn now. My story",1

"If little old me suddenly disappears, it will not change much, will it? I am just one other kid who is being pushed through an education system that romanticizes the untold oppression of the capitalist society. I am just one more employee at Dunkin Donuts that takes your macchiato order, day in, day out; just another mindless machine who has succumbed to the apathetic workforce of industrialized capitalism. You know that coffee I just gave? The hundreds of coffee I gave to people over just a 4 hour shift? I only get a few cents from that, all because some person HAPPENED to be the one who had the money to buy off my life. Oh, but if I stay in there for the next 50ish years, Ill get some retirement benefits. Grow up, Mrs. CEO. You just want people to sign away their time to work for your business, so they can just turn around and give all that money to a college in order to earn a degree that has increasing less value in modern society. Then I go and work for a company, at a higher paying job, that takes all my investments into education and claims my work as theirs, so they may slowly pay back the debts I have over the next thirty years, all the while throwing the pretty carrot of retirement in my face. But then I finally eat it, and I realize that even the garden-fresh carrot was the product of a private, oppressive organization the healthcare system. Because, as it so turns out, I was not given the proper preventative medicine in order to combat against the underlying heart issues in my family, so I end up having a heart attack that will leave me debilitated for the rest of my second half of my life which also costs 10,000 grand, by the way, which will climb the corporate ladder of the healthcare system to lay at the polished feet of the corporate elite, 80 percent intact. Why? Why live in such a world. Why decide to face that, family difficulties, and medical depression that was not even talked about before I had the devil staring at me through the crimson-painted mirror of a kitchen knife? Why? it will get better, they say. it will change they say. Really? Then why did you hesitate after I just explained the oppressive world you live in? And you know what the worst part is? I am a white male. I have got it exponentially better than almost anyone else. Which is sad, and utterly despicable. I do not know if I bring anything to this world",0

"30 years old, and massively behind my peers career wise because of various reasons. Have had 3 long distance relationships but never met any of them in person. I have never even held hands with a girl that is not a family member, never kissed, never had any form of intimacy. My last relationship ended with me begging them to talk to me one last time and them blocking me everywhere. I am unlovable and they are trying their best to forget me, because that is how much of a garbage fucking person I am. My existence is disease to them and they are rightly trying to get rid of it. My home life was always garbage since I was born. Mentally abused by my father since I can remember. I was never given a chance to be a child. I was forced to grow up at a young age. So much pressure and expectations until I went into major depression and just stopped trying. I had to stop my dad from killing my mother recently. He started choking the life out of her and I had to restrain him while watching the blood drop from my mothers face. That image and this memory will forever be with me, breaking me apart even more. In the last 3 years I have been trying again because I saw some hope, but its gone now. I do not see a point to be alive anymore, I do not want to kill myself yet I think. But if I could just stop existing forever I would take that in heartbeat. I just want to not exist. 30 year old and my life is a joke.",1
"Sometimes I just want to give up. The reason why will sound so petty and hilarious to you, ha ha. I am a 24 year old man. I am a virgin. this is a problem for me, not because I am desperate for an orgasm upgrade (my right hand does a decent enough job), but because I want validation that I am worth someone is time and that they will get that close to me. I want to love someone and know them intimately and vise versa. I do not think people who have had a partner actually understand this. they are always like ""its just sex"". Uh, no, for me, its a symbol of acceptance into humanity, a symbol of love and acceptance. Sure my mom loves me. She has to. The trick is to convince a total stranger that you are worth something. In my eyes, I am a loser and pathetic. I cannot tell you how painful that is. And to get to the point, I feel like I will take so long to recover. I have allot on my plate. A court case, drug addictions, social isolation, depression, unemployment, a bunch of nasty scars that are obviously self-inflicted, learning disabilities. Need I mention, a brain that is fantastic at compiling excuses. I feel like a disgusting and unnatractive wretch. I am sure you can understand that from what I listed. But also, please understand that I am desperate to reach out and have someone tell me I am worth spending time with. At my lowest most loserish point, I have become more desperate for affection than I have ever been in my life. Shit luck, that is. And I cannot help but think I will be into my thirties by the time I have ""focused on myself"" long enough to fuck. And then? Well, Ill get to fuck ugly thirty year olds. There it is, there is the petty point I have been tryuing to get to this whole time. To be honest, I like to look at 18-22 year olds, young people, that is who I am attracted to. And I have squandered my opportunities to be with those people. And I am never going to be bezos and be able to pay for peoples affection, adn I do not think I am going to look like arnold schwarznegger either. So I have missed out. Also I am drunk right now.

"Do any of you just that this feeling that, if someone held you for a bit, maybe everything will be okay?I mean like, holding you as you cry and mumble about your troubles. Maybe rubbing your back or patting your head reassuringly. Never discouraging you from your emotions, only letting you and your saddness exist with them. Maybe whispering ""let it out"", or ""its okay"", or even ""it is all going to be okay"", without ever shushing you. Maybe I am just that bad, though, I would be lying if I said I did not find comfort in this pathetic fantasy.God, this just makes me feel more ashamed of my feelings. I have never attempted to yet, but I cannot help feeling like I do not want to exist anymore. Surely, I do not really have a right to complain, when I have never fought the battle, right?Either way, I guess it would just be nice to be with someone who wanted me around. Who maybe was not repulsed by me, at least once.That might help me avoid the inevitable.. at this point. Loneliness really does feel like a slow-acting poison",1
Psychotic I know. Killing myself as revenge on ex boyfriend,1
"it is too long for me now. Everything just gets worse and worse. there is nothing in this world i know, but pain, sadness and tears. I just need someone that loves me how I am, someone that does not only criticizes me or says how bad I am and everytime I find a person like this I think I get friend zoned instantly, I mean that does not mean that is bad, but I want a person that lays beside me in my bed and that I can hold tightly and feel safe with. And why can I give so many people good advises, but I can help myselft even a little bit. I think I am just too broken for everything. A long time I could hide my sadness, but now it is hard to not break down in tears every single second I am awake and that is just annoying. And even my friends I can talk about everything, I do not think they want to hear me more crying about myself, so that is why I just stopped talking about my feelings lately. One example is, I met this girl only around 2 months ago and I think i could talk with her about everything that bothers me, but lately I feel like everytime I say to her that I am sad, she just gets annoyed by this and this really breaks my heart, because I really do not want to lose her, I already lost so many people in my life another one would break me completely. I really do not know what I am going to do the next years, I am so afraid that I am doing something really bad to me, because I do not want to disappoint my parents or my friends that I am so weak. I have never showed any of my weaknesses to anyone, but I do not wana do this anymore, I do not want to fake anything about me. I think life and everything around it, is just a cruel and depressing place. I hate it to be single, I just want to be loved, but I really do not think that anyone ever could really love me and this just fcks me up. There is no day in like 2 years now where I do not cry me to sleep. And on top of everything, in the last months everything around me changed and that to fast, I had to let go of long friends, I had to realize a close friend of mine is in deep depressions and so much more and I just cannot process all of it. I tried talking to that girl I mentioned before, but she acts completely different than at the first days I talked to her. She was like she did not tried to give a good advice or to comfort me, she just like said to me that I cannot change it and I should not bother about it, which is not really helpful. I mean I am not mad at her I am just confused and I am too shy to ask her why she is acting so different. I am just such a weak person, like I am not even trying anymore to be strong or sth because it does not matter, I can smile how long i want I public it does not will change anything ever. I do not want to kill myself, but at the same time I do not want to love anymore, I just want to not exist anymore and no one on this entire planet ever remembers me or even knows that I existed. Everytime this girl texts me, I can smile and even when it is only for a few seconds, in this few second I am truly happy and I do not think she knows that, but she probably does not like me the way I like her and that is the reason I do not want to confess my feelings to her, because I know this will just end up in she not texting me or not answering my messages and I think then I am done with everything. This might sounds stupid I know, but she is the first girl I met ever to just like me how I am and not to look a certain way and this feeling is just awesome, I felt like there was some hope for me. And I said to myself before I was texting so much with her, that I am not getting into a state like I am, but I just could not resist, I could not belive how perfect she is and that brought me to the point, where I maybe cannot live without her and that is even more terrifying, because I know on some day I will fuck everything up and Ill completely lose her. I could type so much more, but idk I think that was long enough. Oh btw I am 17 and I know this just could be phase, but like I said I cannot take this anymore and I do not know what to do now. If you are read this, till here i want to thank you. I love it to talk about my feelings and this place is probably the best for it.And yes that was all know thx and bye I think I am done with everything",1
"I have been having the same issue for a long time now. I try to improve my situation by doing stuff and distracting myself, trying to find new peers but it does not really seem to help or work out. Then when I am feeling down people (especially my toxic mom) says that I do not try and should just find friends and be happy. She never offers support or help and just says that I am depressed and super lazy. I put in effort but almost nobody sees it",1
"do not get me wrong, there are good moments. But my biggest wish is to just not wake up, I have tried everything this past year to feel better and the better I feel the harder it feels when I come back to the reality that I have no desire to live. I do not think I can ever change enough to feel happy, so what is the point of even trying? Especially when the only place that I even try to cry out for help is anonymous. Do people ever actually feel like they enjoy being alive?",1
"Some details:\- he is in his early 30s. \- he is living with my parents, as well as working for them at their small business.\- he is been to university and colleges, but never completed any degrees.\- He shuts himself away from everyone, it is extremely difficult to contact him to reach him - this is by his design. \- He is overweight, and spends most of his free time playing videogames, mostly WoW. \- He smokes multiple joints a day, and is on no other medication.I love my brother dearly, and I want to try and help him help himself. I try to stay connected with him in the only way that I can, which is through setting up weekly video gaming sessions with him, where on a Friday, we will spent 5h or so playing through Dark Souls or Bloodborne or something that requires a lot of communication and coordination between us. he is happiest when he and I are kicking ass or have vanquished an invader. Sometimes I try to ask him how he is doing inside, and if he spends time talk to himself - but he literally shuts me down, and then goes silent for hours at a time. I see a therapist for my own issues, and that work that I have done there has helped me a lot. I believe that he sees his own situation as being so dire that he cannot fathom a way out. He does not get along well with my parents, he is extremely bad tempered and lashes out to them. They do not know how to handle him at all, and the situation is completely out of their control or emotional/mental ability to resolve. They all need help, tbh, but it has to begin with my brother (in my opinion, which is not a professional opinion by any means). In August I am going to visit them for two weeks. I am bringing my dog with me, who I hope will help soften my brother a bit, as he is genuinely kind hearted and loves animals. My goal is to try and find some time to allow him to open up, and share his thoughts and feelings, but he seems so hardened, and up until now, I have failed time and time again to get him to open up. How can I help my brother? What can I do to let him know that I care deeply for him and his wellbeing, and that I want him to seek the help he needs to begin taking back control of his life.And to my bro, if you are reading this and somehow have figured out it is me, please know that I am there for you buddy. I believe my adult brother has depression and undiagnosed ADHD. I live 12h driving away. How can I help him when he does not want any help?",0
"I just turned 25 this Monday, and I kind of wanted to end myself on that day for a few months now. did not do it. Now, I am still around, still miserable, still missing my ex, hating my living situation, and being uninspired. But I am also 25, and if I am not going to die, then I am going to regret living the way I am. This is a miserable existence that I do not know how to handle. I already left a message for my family, just in case, but the natural human instinct will not let me take myself out. This is pain. The longer you live in misery, the more you suffer and want to end it. Alternatively, if you are not going to end yourself, you are wasting life while being miserable. Existential dread is destroying me.",1
"Why is selfishness and greed so rampant in society? Why is everyone a megalomaniac? Why does everyone want attention? Why do most people do more harm than good? Why is humanity not there in us humans? Why does everyone think the other person is always wanting something from them? Why does discrimination exist? Be it based on colour, religion, economic status, social status, anything. Why do people like to abuse someone verbally or in any other form just because they can? Why can we not get rid of this? I do not know. Maybe there is something wrong with me. Why is this world full of shitty people?",0
"But I hate not being anyone's favorite. I am sure I am no one's best friend, i am not the love of anyone's life, I am not anyone's person in general. I suppose(doubt it) people care about me, sure, but I am no one's favorite. there is not a single person that values me above anyone else. I am honestly thinking of either disembowling myself or doing something else to end my life in a gory and disgusting way I know I sound repetitive",1

"I do not even know why I am posting here to be honest. Ill most likely post this on from this throwaway account and then remove the throwaway account without ever looking at it again. I came across this sub today by chance and read through many peoples sad and heartbreaking stories, riddled with trauma, abuse and misfortune I do not know myself. I have not suffered any trauma at the hands of anyone other than myself and there is no sympathy to be had for me, even if I wanted it. I have been struggling with myself for as long as I can remember, back to Kindergarten at the very least and have always hated myself ever since. It seems to be a deep character flaw, that even when I am aware that I am displaying it, I am not fully aware of just how annoying, toxic and delusional I accurately am. Over the last 10 years or so, I have been slowly and methodically pushing everyone out of my life, family and friends, and have not even been fully conscious that I was doing so until recently in the last several years, when it was much too late and everyone had already gone. It really sunk in when my last best friend disappeared on me, and I spent forever thinking what a shitty person he is and passing the flaws off onto him. But in hindsight, he was the smartest friend I ever had for taking the initiative on his own. there is only one person left in my life physically, and I hate myself more and more each day that I have not relieved her of the burden that is me. Her exact words recently have reinforced my feelings here, and which help me understand that the problem is within me, and it is me. I do not know if my self-hatred will ever be able to successfully override my innate narcissism for me to actually go through with anything. I have been to therapy and been on meds and those things can be highly beneficial to many people, but I am an non-special outlier here I believe because I am flawed to my core. I have always known how to do it the easiest, most painless and least messy but I have never been able to override my selfishness and narcissism enough to legitimately come close. Each day now though seems to just draw closer and closer to my own doomsday clock. The culmination of my life",1

"I try so hard to focus on myself and my well-being, yet its impossible. I can give the most motivational, inspirational speech to a person who needs help. But I cannot do anything close to that for myself. I care about other people so much more than myself. I put myself and my well-being as my last priority. Everyone, I mean everyone I know is a higher priority than myself. I just want to care and love myself burning does not seem to be a possibility. Has anyone found a way out of this hole? I cannot care about myself",0
I am so close to ending it. I find everyday more difficult and challenging than the last and I do not feel like trying. I just want to die please I just want to die. I cannot do this I cannot do this. This is unfair. This is cruel. I wish I had never never never been born. This is torture. Living is torturing me. Hanging on by a thread,1

"What the title says. I have been on sertraline for almost two weeks and I am not feeling anything at all. Even side effects are not present, contrary to popular experience (or at least, that is what I perceive). Is this common at all? For clarification, I have depression, anxiety, and if it adds relevance, ADHD. This is also my first time taking medication, of any kind (at least regarding mental health). Thank you all in advance. Almost two weeks on sertraline, and yet, have not felt any difference. Not even side effects.",0

I have been mistreated and abused ever since I was 3 and it hurts but I have just gotten used to it.I have had four suicide attempts and they all failed miserably, it is kind of embarrassing. I have been suicidal and depressed for as long as I can remember. I really want to attempt again but I am kind of scared it will go wrong again.before anyone says oh get help or talk to someone, I did and they never took me seriously or even tried to care.

The world will always remain cruel and selfish, what is the point of being alive in such a destroyed society. I rather just be dead. I cannot help any of these people I cannot even help myself. what is the point of living when so many suffer. My life is meaningless and I am useless. what is the point",1
So when I m alone I always get sad that nobody cares of me that I have nobody to talk about my problems but when there is people who starts caring about me b it gets so fucking annoying I get jealous of their other friends I do not even like seeing them fucking happy but when I push those people away I regret doing that and it is starts over and over fucking again Hate being around people but getting sad being lonely,0
I find myself never quite feeling joyful about anything. I am so over living in my hometown and I feel so trapped here. I feel isolated and physically uncomfortable often.

"He was murdered by his friends who invited him out to dinner only to kill him in a brutal slow way, while he was all alone with them at night. Everyone knew they did it, but they had to be released because they could not get enough evidence. The kid who died was innocent and had a gf. It happened in the winter, in a very tiny, stormy seaside town. This kid's death only got a physical newspaper snippet or two, nothing more. No online articles or any records or anything, it is like he was just forgotten about with the exception of a handful of people who remember reading those articles in the printed newspaper shortly after the murder happened. Or the people who worked with him and claimed to have seen his ghost wandering around.. that is it. It was almost a decade ago this happened. Is it normal that the death of a teenager who was murdered by his friends long ago keeps making me very depressed?",0

"I dropped out shortly after turning 17. I have just turned 23 now. I cannot believe how fast time moves, and I can barely recall anything that happened from 2015-2019. I did almost nothing in those years, probably a deep undiagnosed depression when looking back on it.I do not feel like I have mentally or physically developed since I turned 19. It makes me sick to my stomach. I could have been in a coma for 6 years and nothing would have changed.My only real excuse is a major surgery when I was 18 that put me out of commission until I was 19, but of course I wielded that as a shield against questions and responsibilities, and when that passed, I faked distance education from age 20 to 21. COVID served as a grand excuse for the first 6 months of last year. I snapped out of this ridiculous mindset in mid 2020 and earned a spot at a decent university, but now I am now STARTING it properly at the age many people who had their mind straight at 18 FINISHED it.I did not stress it when I was 18, 19 or even 20, I completely palmed off life as a money game without considering the experiences I was missing, so how am I going to answer the age question with ""23"" while maintaining a straight face? What about ""24"" in 11 months? I feel like I have missed so much already that the actions I am taking now are mostly meaningless. People I once knew are already having kids, getting promotions, and going through grad school, they had their fun and they have got a big circle of friends to show for it.I will be fucking 27 or even 28 by the time this 5 year degree is over, just thinking of how close that is to 30 makes me upset. Taking stock and writing this helps, even if no one reads it. I hold no hatred for anyone but myself. How do I deal with so much lost time?",0
"i do not know what could be lying after death. it could be being reborn, it could be heaven or hell, it could be a deep, dark void. i do not want to care about it, but i do. i just want to end it all, but I am afraid of what could happen next. i do not care if i get eternal torture, i do not care if its a deep void, i just want an escape. just thinking about death is so weird and interesting to me, though. where does our conciousness go? what happens to our thoughts and experiences? is there anything at all after death? if god exists, will i be forgiven for all my sins? i do not know an answer to any of these, but i want to know. its a form of curiosity, but also a form of wanting an escape. what if the world after is better? will i still enjoy life when everythings perfect? will not it just get tiring? as i write this, i slowly feel less and less like i want to die, and more like maybe i have to do what i can with my life, and work hard, then i can do what i dream of. i do not want help anymore, i just want to die, but am too afraid to do so.",0
"You know, I try not to put my own symptoms above anyone else's. But it is a hard point to argue. I have lost more than most people ever will and I do not say that to spite people nor say their pain is less than mine.&amp;#x200B;I could write a book about the crap I have been through, I have actually. Not officially published but I have written a book. &amp;#x200B;More to the point, it makes me wonder why. Why was I put here? Why this body? Why this life? What in the FUCK did I do in my past life or whatever to deserve this? Seriously, I want to know. Was I like, Hitler or something?&amp;#x200B;You may ask yourself ""he cannot be that bad, right?"" And you would be wrong.&amp;#x200B;I will give you a brief overview immediate victim of favoritism within the first 3 years of life. I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years. parents stole me from each other, back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly, sexually abused me frequently and to top it off, keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows, no clocks, no way to tell time. Leaving me in there for days at a time. This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed, my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost. He only got me back for the SSI check. Other than that, I did not exist to him pretty much in school, I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats, I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis. Their laundry was, mine was not. already extremely socially isolated, things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital. Made me realize what a monster I was. during the last couple years of high school, I found my high school sweetheart. We were together for 7 years. We made a son together. he is currently 17, turning 18 later this year. social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots, which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots. So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head. Tell her she does not need me. She leaves me, takes me to court for 100% custody. At that point, I did not think I could possibly be more broken. I did not have a choice, so I just gave up and within 2 months, she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another. a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new. Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship. I could never trust her. still, she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me. I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run, run away from me. I suppose in some way, I did just not in so many words. towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn. His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck, killing him days before he was due. Just a few days. we split ways after this. I took the loss personally, as though it was God's way of punishing me for being the monster I was. Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself. All failed, obviously. a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family. So naturally, I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her. while we were in person together, things were amazing. It was like gravity, we could not stay away from each other. But when the time came to part ways... that is when things got ugly, fast. still, we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son. I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did. We had talked about several times. I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me. Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father. First her, it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with. So that is what she did. He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born. after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me, I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life. I just gave up. She was not going to change her mind ever. So I walked away. more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me. So that is what I did. I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life. something clicked inside, like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently, I became different than who I was before. The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born. I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family, but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship. This one was actually pretty good. I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship. I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son, her friends, her family. I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her, open to the idea this could last, it honestly felt like it was my forever home. I let myself actually believe in that. as you may suspect, things eventually fell apart. She pulled away from me, stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her, communicate what was going on to no avail. The day we broke up, she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sister-in-law's dog. Well, I found out that that whole story was a lie, just from a Facebook post of her sister-in-law at home with her two children, getting ready for the weekend. in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love. Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now. at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore. I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again. So what else is there for me? I could never have my family, cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable. I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time, wasting my therapist's time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of love.&amp;#x200B;that is just a chunk of my iceberg. The super short, short version. I suppose that is why it is so hard for me to believe that anyone could even comprehend the things I have been through. The bottom is not where you think it is. There are places in the mind, much darker, much deeper than you may ever know. End all, Be all",0

Does anyone have financial-stress related suicidal feelings? I got a surprise bill and I have already been spending this past year cutting back on food so that I can afford groceries.

I cannot keep living like this. I have no money.,1
"I have basically determined I probably have clinical depression and anxiety. I feel like every aspect of my life is spiraling into the worst state I have ever been in. Physical, mental, sexual health all terrible. Career and relationship feeling stagnant. I have started the process to start therepy soon and plan on joining a gym too. But motivation is difficult. All of this feels extremely overwhelming and like I am drowning in thoughts all day everyday. To my point, my girlfriend wants a second Cat and pretty much begs/pesters me about it every once in a while, then tries to guilt me for not letting her get one. Borderline emotionally manipulative and immature I am going to. Adding/introducing a second cat into our lives is literally not even on my lists of priorities for getting my life in order right now. And my gf does not seem to care that inside my own head I am dealing with a lot more than looking at cute cats and wanting one. Am I being selfish in not allowing her to get one till i feel better and feel like dealing with it, or is she being selfish by not accepting my desires to hold off?As an aside, we did try adding a second cat from a rescue a couples month ago against my wishes (she begged on her birthday till I caved). It went aweful and returning him was very emotionally difficult for the both of us and not something I would like to experience again in my current state.What are your thoughts? Hold off on getting a pet?",0
"This started around 2019, probably because of exams or something maybe I do not know, I thought I will be handle it on my own but it just does not seem to stop. I feel like I am scared of everything, scared of failing when I try to do something, scared of tomorrow, scared of my future. It just does not feel like how I was before, two years back I was just a stupid 16 year old that did not care even if someone said something and just loved hanging out, but now even the smallest 'no' to my demands makes me want to cry like nothing else. It feels immature of me and I just cannot do anything about it, the more I think about it the more it hurts in the chest and I just want to forget it. I have run out of motivation to do anything at all now, I wanted to focus on getting a better college, focus better on my academics but these thoughts of 'Why am I even doing this?' just keeps on coming up my mind. The last week I had a dream of my sister being blind from one eye and begging on the streets and I was freaked out about it, I never talked to my mom or sis about this because since dad died everything had been depressing in this house and we were finally starting to get back into like again, we laugh at jokes, talk about stuff like a normal family while having food and I love that and I just do not want that to go away or make them worried. Just yesterday I thought of just forgetting all of this and so I just stepped out of the house, there was a road I had to cross and I do not exactly understand what happened, all I remember was there was some thought on my mind and I just stood there thinking about it, in the middle of the road. Fortunately, the driver was driving slow and just honked on me snapping me out of it. I used to love doing stuff, coding, writing, reading and even sometimes focus on my academics but now, it is like everything has lost it is taste, it is like I do not recognize myself anymore like as if it is not the 'me' anymore. I have been crying and crying all over again thinking this will be over, but it never stopped. I feel lost.",0
"Plan A: Run off alone to the city, wait for nighttime to get kidnapped, then whatever happens happens. Optionally wear the most revealing clothes possible.Plan B: Attempt to run away again, but get more physical with cops. Hopefully physical enough they just shoot me. Optionally have a weapon of some sort.Plan C: Brutally reject some incel so he may kill me himself.Motive: constant thoughts of being a financial and/or emotional burden to parents due to autism; more specifically, extreme meltdowns that become part of plan A. In addition, I do not believe unconditional love exists and I do not understand why they still love me after everything I have done. I even started openly looking for groomers again, even that does not work Well fuck, there is a plan B and C now",1
"so for awhile I have not been, yk 100% its been like that for years but two years ago is when everything kind of pushed me over the edge. I do not mean to get all daddy issues here but two years ago I saw my dad for the first time in six years, the circumstances on why I had to see him were not the best but who cares. The days prior leading up to seeing him again Id have panic attacks, it stressed me out thinking about him, it made me really tired and just did not feel like doing anything anymore, and when I saw him I blanked out. I met my younger half brothers (absolutely love them). A few weeks after is when shit started sinking in and it became overwhelming for me, I started attending school one day a week or not at all, Id have multiple panic attacks outside the school gate or silent breakdowns in my room and learning the things he did made me despise him. I could not bring myself to do things anymore. since then I have lost a bunch of people I once called friends, I dropped out this year at 17 and have no fucking clue what to do with my life I am going to be seeing him again in a couple days and I honestly do not know what to think or how to feel, I am just scared,tired and alone :/ Tired :T",0

Admitting to yourself that you have been doing the wrong things is painful. And right now I am going through that phase. This pain makes me just want to hop in bed and stare at the ceiling. But I think I can get past it. I feel like one of the biggest hurdles to getting better is that you got to admit to yourself that you have been doing things wrong for a long time,0

"I have been on Prozac for about 8 months now. It has been life changing. After getting over the first two months of awful ramp up side effects, this medicine just plain makes me happy and enjoy life. I am a better mom because of it. However, I have gained 30 lbs on it and I eat the same as I always have and work out diligently. I know its the meds. Has anyone tried adding something to Prozac or another SSRI that has helped lose or stave off weight gain? Wellbutrin? Prozac weight gainadd Wellbutrin?",0

I feel bad whenever I have to cancel stuff and come up with a dumb excuse. Sometimes I am just so sad that the thought of interacting with someone makes me want to vomit. It makes me look like I do not value the person or Id rather be doing something else but its just that I need to be alone. Every once in a while Ill just admit that I really do not feel like interacting but they will either push me to do so until I accept or just worry about me. Ahh man it just sucks I really hate canceling things but I just cannot do it,0
"I always try to better myself, and allow people to enjoy the journey, experiences and ideas i have to do it, and somehow everyone that comes along benefits from it and i just stay in their shade and i am sick of it honestly.

"Once upon a time I was picked on and bullied as a kid. Abused by a step father also. After high school though things changed. I became popular, had a wide network of friends, lots of parties, lots of sex, I experienced so much in my early to mid 20s. But I got older and got more responsible. I made a lot of money and I became independent. But now I sit here pretty much alone. I thought I had a close knit group of friends but I do not hear from them anymore. I am lonely. Have been for several years now. I want to meet a woman, but none will give me the time of day. I want to make new friends but I have pretty bad social anxiety around new people. Idk what to do. I do not even know why I am posting this.. My life went in a direction that I want and do not want.",0
"I finally said something to my ""Best best"" friend about being excluded. Was told it is because the people I thought were my friends (known a decade, at my wedding etc) ""enjoy spending time with just them"". Just realized I have spent a decade trying to get them to invite me was a fucking waste. My (now former) ""best-best"" friend somehow convinced the others to put up with me for a while. 4 years ago got invited on 1 camp out, 1 Friendsgiving, and that was it.That was the only Friendsgiving I have ever been invited to. I should have known a long time ago they were not my friends. But I cannot be suicidal, my kid needs me. Finally decided I would rather be alone than in bad company (but this still sucks)",0
"I am so tired . The worst part of this disease is that there is never a bottom. Everytime you think you have reached the worst level of this you unearth an entire new lower level of depression. I want to go home . that is all I keep telling myself, but home is not here . Home is not here on earth . Its somewhere else . I feel like I do not belong on this planet . I hate being here so much . I have missed work a lot lately because everything seems pointless, the depression is unbearable now. I want to kill myself so bad . I want to go home . No one knows how bad this shit is . No one knows how unbearable this is . All I can say these days is I want to go home. I want to go home. that is it. that is all I got left in me, that is all I can tell you at this point . I hate it here.",0

"For probably at least 95% of the rest of the population (not a fact) dating seems so incredibly easy but for me it just seems impossible. Try and picture seeing everyday someone has someone, when you see someone kissing their boyfriend/girlfriend when no one has ever thought of you as more than a friend.Everyday when you see couples hugging passionately and you see their love for one another, full well knowing it is likely going to be years before you find someone.For some people this is going to be a moment, but everyday it becomes a little bit harder to get on with life normally because it becomes so difficult sometimes. Like what did I ever do to not be good enough for someone, is there something wrong with me? I have never been kissed on the lips, I mean not ever in my life, I am still a virgin (not by choice), (only 18 more years until they make a documentary about me). I have tried everything dating apps etc. I have never actually tried asking girls just out of the blue or in person but would that really make a big difference?Oh god, can someone just help me ffs. It honestly eats me up inside everyday and I really do not know how much more I can take. How and why does dating seem so easy for everyone else apart from me? (22 M) (Virgin)",0
"there is absolutely no point of my existence and no I cannot find a reason or purpose or whatever the fuck that is, I am a prisoner in this cursed house because of my fucking family and I even became a prisoner of all these dark thoughts in my head, I have so many issues both physically and emotionally and most of them will not ever change, I am all alone literally I have no friends anymore, not even one and obviously my family's the absolute worst, what am I doing here then?

"I am not stupid. I am super lucky. I have got a beautiful wife, 2 kids under 3, a mortgage and a steady job I have had for nearly 10 years - and I just turned 30. I am not supposed to feel like shit all the time. I am not supposed to have suicide ideation every second day. I am not supposed to get to the point I did this week where I nearly jumped off a multi story car park. So why is it that all the good things just feel like meet distractions and when the world slows down enough I just immediately think about ending it all? Why do I react negatively to everything as a first response, putting unwanted strain on my relationships and reinforcing this idea that I am a burden to those around me? I see a lot of posts of people who have shit situations on here, and I understand completely why you feel the way you feel. I just feel guilty for feeling the same way when by all counts I should not. But I do. I am still not sure I will not just turn around and hang myself I have got a lot to be thankful for. So why do I still want to end it all?",1

If I die I will not have to hear about him call me weak minded and all the names in the book that just show how much he hates suicidal people. I will not have to hear my sense of self being destroyed from the inside out by her cruel words or the pressure. I will not have to hear everyone call me weak, because how dare I think of killing myself?I cannot see myself making it past highschool.

"Hello friends,I have struggled with depression for years. I have been on Lexapro for \~2 years. It...helped. Sort of. Still felt worthless, tired, sad, irritable, suicidal, etc., but maybe it took the edge off. However, I did have some sexual side effects (hard to finish, hard to stay up).Fast forward to this year, and I got a better doctor who decided to add Wellbutrin. After about a month, it is like switch flipped. I still have problems, but they do not seem insurmountable. Especially to how I have felt in the past, it is a nice change.Now, my question is - should I start weening off Lexapro? Not sure it did a ton, and the side effects were...not ideal. But I am not sure if the two meds are working together. Just wanted to get some thoughts so I do not backslide.Thanks! Medication opinions - Lexapro and Wellbutrin",0

This is absolutely destroying all of my relationships and I hate it so much. The most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or showering feel impossible a lot of the time.

"So I am 20, male. Still at their place. Still in the house of the man who, on multiple occasions, had tried to choke me to death. Still in the house of the women who took his side when he tried doing what he had done, while talking shit behind his back about him. Still in the house of twofaced individuals who maintain the image of good, just, kind, outgoing people. Whenever I told my situation to anyone who knew anything about them, the response was the same - ""your mother loves you more than anything, your father is so funny, your depression is making all those things up, get a grip"". I do not even know if I am even remembering things correctly or if I am making things up. I have no proof of being beaten, of being yelled at, of being manipulated, of being persistently made fun of, I have none of that. Hell, the only reason I am working right now is because of my father. Of the same father who was only present in my life to berate me, to beat me, to try to kill me. Granted, I have failed a lot throughout my life, I did not study at all, I was at my PC all day, so I sort of do entertain the idea of me deserving all this. I did waste my life and academically, I did not do shit. I dropped out of college too and I feel like the only reason they have accepted this decision was because they just all gave up on me. My mother, father, sister, grandmother they just do not give a shit anymore and it makes me miss the yelling, the beating, the threats, because at least then, they had cared about me. And now my only plan is to move out. Not even to a different town, just a different place. But what about after that? I will still be a friendless loner with no life skills, with no life experiences, with no talents, with a minimum wage job, what then? I will still be alone, all by myself. Maybe I deserve that. I do not even know anymore. I am trying to be as objective as I can, but through my own perspective, I cannot. I am just so tired of being alone, of not fitting in. I am tired of knowing a fuck ton of people and telling all of them about how I should have killed myself and how I have no future, no ambition, nothing. I am tired of not having anyone to love, of not belonging to a group of people that will just do whatever the fuck. I am tired of my prime being wasted. I am tired of not having that wild life that I am supposed to have by now, because I have no one. I am tired of being the incompetent extrovert who can talk to people, but cannot be with people because I leave them all or vice versa. I just do not know what to do anymore. Daydreaming about doing the over the top proposal to the one is beyond pathetic given that reality will never happen. Daydreaming about making it big with music is beyond sad given that I do not have the talent nor do I know anything about mixing, mastering, processing and shit like that and my voice is pathetic. Daydreaming about being at peace with myself is beyond unreasonable given that I have been alone for so long that I feel like I have gone insane already. I am just lost, what am I supposed to do given that all the psychiatrists are scam artist scumfucks? Everything has gone down the shitter and even if I get out, nothing good will come out of it",0

Now I might be kind of a worthless piece of shit but also I am not that bad. I do not get violent with people, I have never sexually assaulted or done something really fucked up to people. Probably the worst I have done is say some hurtful things and lie. Even though the rational part of my brain can look through all this and go 'well i guess you are not the worst piece of shit, it dosent really effect how I feel about myself. I still hate everything about me from my stupid body to my stupid mind. I know its probably a bit much for what I am but god fucking hate me.

Constantly laying in bed, trying to get out of it only to fall right back into it.. Insomnia and Excessive Sleepiness haunt my life..At work, it is not any better...I do a Laborious Job and constantly feeling drained of energy while on the job makes me feel like I am not enough despite there being older people than me there who do not really feel tired...I have a constant feeling of disassociation, feeling like I do not belong in my own body...like my mind has been only added to it...I constantly see shadows or things that are not there and it is driving me insane sometimes..I constantly forget things when it is just been told to me and I hate it! I feel so..stupid for not remembering anything...I try so hard to remember what I just forgot, but it never comes back...I cannot even remember special things unless it is in writing...I feel like I am combatting myself.. Like I have two different personalities mixed into one. My personality before depression when I was a Teenager as a Freshman in High School and after depression hit... there is the Empathetic, Helpful, Patient side and then there is the Depressive Side where I am prone to being numb, very irritated, easy to anger, and just plain not caring about myself. it is...making me feel so...disconnected.I feel so bad when I get very irritated and mad at my Mom for not understanding my depression and just needing help on the same things I tell her about...she is forgetful sometimes and she needs time to understand...it is not her fault...I feel like a bad son sometimes...Then there is the heavy guilt and anxiety...I feel like I cannot control it even with the Medication I am taking...I feel like such a mess that nobody should be bothering with..All of this just makes me feel so disconnected from people...I want to be alone...but I do not at the same time... it is like my mind does not know what it wants anymore...I cannot even play MMORPGs and other genres of games I enjoy without feeling like I want to drop them as fast I got into them. it is so stressful and annoying...Even though I have a Job, a Loving Relationship of 5 Years, Family Members that I guess still care about me..I do not even care about myself. I still do not know what it means be truly happy...it never lasts..I always have to put up a Facade to avoid having to explain myself or worry people..I only recently found out what this is.. ""Smiling Depression"" I always one day hope I will not have to act like I am completely fine and stable, but everyday that hope dwindles till only nothing is left.. I feel like I should not exist.

"I literally have NO CLUE why the hell I am writing here... this is pissing me off... I guess I have some questions but there is part of me scared that rather than me getting demotivated and turned away from my thoughts, I might actually give others bad ideas. Whatever...it is just beyond frustration to google the ""so many versions"" of the same question, which might be obvious since I am writing in this sub, and then get the same fucking results every single time just from different websites with the same retarded ""self-help"" ideas (that do not work btw!).But I digress... So here is the meat of the issue: there is absolutely no point to life and/or living. Living makes zero sense and the only logical thing to do is death. And the more I try to distance myself from this shit the more it pursues me. I cannot see the point of life and living, which is not even the biggest issue in and of itself, but I can see a truckload of reasons to die. Guess that is where I am at: no reasons to live, but too many to count to end it.Wherever I google reasons to keep going, all that comes up is stuff like ""tomorrow is another day"", ""it is going to get better if you give it some time"" and ""just get through today"". HEY ASSHOLE! How about after 3.000 (literally) *another day* that sentence seems more like a threat than a message of hope? How about it not getting better? How about getting through today is THE VERY REASON for this? there is only so many *todays* you can get through.Some are even worse, like ""try new things"", ""change how you do things"" and ""Jesus loves you"". The first two basically do not even consider that it might go both ways, whereas the last... Not even going to address it. Honestly, I guess if I could believe (however I cannot, and also am conflicted about it) then it would trick me into the whole ""divine plan"" kind of thing which, as stupid as it is, at least would make it all make sense.Also why bother going to a shrink? To what? Get myself pumped up on drugs that will numb me and, supposedly, get me through another 30 years of this shit? it is not like it would solve the core issue. It would not provide for immortality, hence still ending up in the same place through different means, nor would it give life purpose. So to speak, ignoring truth does not make it less true.I do realize most of the mainstream stuff has the purpose of getting the people who are going through a specific moment and after that they can go back to normal. But what about... people like... me? Those for whom ""this"" is normal. It is abhorrent to think that once all the layers of BS are stripped, all that is left is a world of pain, nothingness, suffering and decay. And if you think I am selfish well FUCK YOU! Had I been selfish probably my life would not have been the total shitshow that it was/is, and I would not be here (mentally, not on reddit).Is it really eating, sleeping, sex, work, drugs and defecating all there really is to life? And do not give me the whole ""human emotions"" crap, we all know those are just chemicals released by our bodies (and easily created in a lab) to make us perceive something that logically is not there. it is so bad to be in the tunnel and realize the light is a lie (pardon the lame videogame homage).I feel pretty pathetic for writing this, but at this point might aswell post it and see if someone has an answer to offer. no idea why I am doing this but looking for an answer",1
"I hate myself so much.I keep trying things... I keep trying to meet people but I just cannot find anyone I have anything in common with.&amp;#x200B;The answer, the proper human answer, is to change myself to fit everyone else. I cannot do that. I just cannot lie to myself. Maybe it is because I am autistic.I am 30 years old and no one has ever seen me sexually. I feel like everyone I have known would laugh at the idea or anyone ever being in love with me. I have... also never met anyone I have been attracted to. But like. I mean, yeah, I have ""high standards"", but if I myself live up my standards, why is it wrong for me to want to spend time with someone else who works as hard as I do towards the same standards/values?&amp;#x200B;But I feel like no one will ever accept me because I am a virgin. Because I care about sex-positivity and LGBTetc things and things like that (I am pansexual), but I feel like I would not be seen as legitimate, that I would just be laughed out of the room and trashed because I have never actually been with anyone.&amp;#x200B;Just... having no friends is the same as missing an essential nutrient. You just cannot function. No amount of pushing yourself to get over it is going to make up for that. &amp;#x200B;And I am at my limit.&amp;#x200B;I just want to be seen. I just want to be acknowledged as a person. I want to exist. I want to actually exist. I feel like I do not exist because no one notices me. &amp;#x200B;Just... being 100% ignored... it hurts. I just need friends.&amp;#x200B;If I died today, no one would even know. Like. There literally is not a single person anywhere who would miss me.

Every day I am humiliated and insulted whether i hear it or not. I am the worst, most sickest kind of person in the world mentally. Why must i keep being tortured by living when i want to go? It bothers me so much. I sleep outside but i wonder how people who is going through less can successfully end it all and i cannot no matter what I do. I guess I am too broke to even end it.",1

I have not written a note because I am just too tired and I do not have much to say anymore. I have told my family about my pain and they have dealt with two stupid suicide attempts from me in the past so this is not exactly going to be a complete surprise to them. Its also why I feel like a note is not necessary. It would just be superfluous. I am worried about things going wrong. Could burning coals indoors because a fire? I think I am most worried about that which is why I decided to call the police after I have lit up the coals. I will not tell them my address until the very end of the conversation so that there is enough time for the CO to have an effect. Anyway, goodbye I am going to kill myself this weekend.",1

My grandma is old and probably does not have a lot of time left, I do not want to ruin her last year's by living with guilt and sadness. I know her death will be hard on me and I would probably want to off myself but I still have my dog to live for and he is still pretty young. Assuming he lives until 10 I will be gone by the time I turn 18. My time will come soon, but it is not yet. I probably cannot stop sh because there is no way I will cope, I still want to die, I crave death and there is not a day that I do not think about it, it is the first thing I think when I wake up and the last thing I think when I go to sleep but I will try to live for them. I have decided not to",1
"This weekend I sat in the hours by myself like I usually do and it just hit harder this time. I joined BetterHelp in hope of find a way to get myself out of this. I use to be so happy, making jokes all the time calling and texting people but now I just cannot find the reason to do any of it. My family has fallen apart I cannot even have a real conversation with my dad and my mom is just said and I feel for her. I try to distract myself from it but the distraction does not last for long or it just does not work. I am constantly thinking about the old me. The younger me that had friends and would be out of the house all the time. I just feel like there is nothing left me. Ill probably never find love and will just die alone. Its all even harder as a black male, Its like depression in black men just do not exist. I just want this shit to be over. How do you stop feeling so alone? How do you go back to being the old you or even just a newer version of yourself? How do you feel loved again? People make it seem like it just so easy to get all the feeling out of your head but they just do not understand that its not that simple. I am just not feel it anymore",0
"To be honest, I have felt like that for years, but the only thing keeping me here is the fear of the nothingness that comes after you die. I am 21F and I have been depressed since I was 12 (I think, my memory is not that good) and each day I feel like my mental health deteriorates more and more. Yes, I have been able to hold down a job, and I do attend to my college classes, but I feel completly empty, there is not a single spark of joy inside of me.Covid worsened my life by x100, and my country's (Brazil) current situation has been so triggering lately that I have not really been able to watch or hear the news. I miss my friends, I miss taking the bus and petting the stray cats that live on the streets, I miss actually living my life instead of being inside 24/7. I am so tired of how things are, and it feels like nothing ever improves. I want to leave, to give up and die. Too bad I am too scared of what comes after death. I was raised catholic, but I am no longer a believer. I feel like god is punishing us for all the sins the human race has commited. Oftentimes I want to scream and scratch myself, pull my hair and release all that anger and sadness that is been building up inside me for the past year and a half, but I cannot.I am so tired of the pain I have been enduring for nearly a decade, and I am so tired of the recent events that have made this pain increase so much that it hurts to do the simplest of tasks, such as showering. I want it to stop, it hurts so goddamn much to be alive. I do not feel like life is worth it anymore",1
"I am just fee up of everything. Everything and everyone pisses me off and I have tried to be happy but that just does not work. I have made plans of suicide for sometime after i pass my driving test and get a car. Its the only thing i can think of, I have tried self harm but I am too scared of pain, thought about jumping off a building like my brother tried but I am a coward and anything else is too painful or I am scared to do it. I know I have not passed my gcses because i did not try so I probably will not be able to get into college, I am so negative to everyone around me I am scared I am losing friends. Everything about me is just a fucking waste, anyone else could have been born in my place and done better, children are dying in impoverished countries who could have had great potential but people like me were born who are selfish and useless.

All my accomplishments and potential are meaningless now. There is nothing. Love, youth, all gone. Nothing left. Tried to move on and help others. Nothing worked.

"I have read many posts and have wanted to make one but never got the motivation to do so. Today is my birthday a day I hate to celebrate as my life has always been not worth celebrating. I am 52. This year in February I had planned to take my own life with insulin/sub zero temps and alcohol. I had made plans for 3-4 years and researched an infallible processes that did not involve a firearm. I had placed conditions to achieve before I can move forward with said plan. 1) First was for my 104 Year old Gma to pass. She watched as both of her kids die and bury them. She died last year after I was forced to put her in a nursing home due to failing health and many bad falls. 2) Pay off my house and have money in the bank. I achieved both. 3) Encourage my wife to loose some weight and get healthily to find a new guy if she so wanted. 4) get my three sons through post high school education and started on their lives. 5) Get 100% service connection for my gulf war illnesses that makes my every day life hell. 6) All the while, to keep it all a secret. All tasks were completed until my son died.I feel Justified in my analysis that my life is not worth continuing as I have failed in many aspects of my life among many successes I have achieved. From the age of 7-8 or so I was bullied due to moving around a lot. Age 11 is when I began to fantasize about my death by jumping in front of the tires of a full grain truck. I even picked fights with upper high school kids who had bullied me while in 6th grade hoping they would kill me. did not and do not make friends easily if I did they was close until they betrayed me. Now as an adult I tend to have 75% of the people I work with hate/dislike me 10% ignore me and 15% value me and appreciate my ability's as a technician. I am a hard driving person who takes the initiative to get stuff done and focus on the highest achievable result. Unfortunately many times people are made to look bad in contrast to my results so they become spiteful. They then begin a campaign to discredit sabotage or inhibit my efforts to be successful. I tend to be resourceful and clever so I usually spitefully get in the hardest licks by using the system or strait out vengeance.I constantly contemplate my success and failure to evaluate how to be more successful socially and feel that since growing up I never got to have real true friends I lost out on learning those skills is my excuse. Now I can give a crap. Accept me or fuck off kind of deal,now. I look at myself as a broken car I have too many things broken I need to go to the Junk yard. I am also a Farm kid and I have put down many animals that were in bad shape I am no different. I get angry with people who try to convince me I am a human and that I do not work that way or I should not commit suicide. Its my life, run yours. The people who drink too much eat too much or use tobacco never get condemned they are committing slow suicide but that appears to be OK in our society.After the Death of my 24 year old son I told my wife about how I felt about my life and was planning to end it. We talked and she simply said that she was ashamed she never saw it and was ""Afraid to be left alone since I was a little girl."" That was enough for me to remove my suicide plans off the table in the form of a promise. Two weeks after I burred my son the - 20 F weather I wanted was here. But I promised my wife I would not take my own life. I am angry as hell about that I deleted friends from FB called people and told them to fuck off as they failed me deleted a gaming clan I ran for 20+ years. I burned everyone that was close to me so I can suffer even deeper I guess. My son suffered from Schizophrenia due to an ATV accident 7 years ago. COVID, his escalating condition, recent death of a close friend his 2 Gma's and great GMA and other factors made him feel like he had no choice but to take his own life with a gun this January. I am relieved he is no longer suffering from episodes. I am however still suffering and since I failed him I am embracing my daily neuropathic pain, chronic migraines and 20 + other autoimmune conditions and the harassment I get at work. Each day I drive to work hoping I get in an fatal accident to escape this world. I feel my situation is for relief not to make a statement or punish anyone or get attention. This world is hell. Death is my version of heaven.I do not know what to expect from this group. I hope I am not griefed but also not looking for resolving my feelings. I have no outlet for the death of my son, no one helps with my harassment and have no friends. My wife cannot talk about my son with me so am trapped with no way to progress to a new stage in my life as I never expected to be alive. I get counseling at the VA but they are not helpful.If you made it this far thanks for reading. If you have a suggestion or solution please post it. A promise prevents my Suicide makes me Angry because my son committed suicide this January.",1

"I am currently studying master at a Germany University. Currently, I am doing my master thesis. I have been doing it for almost 8 months, and it will be continued up to November 2021. My professor and group leader were nice and good, but unfortunately, my guide (a PhD scholar) exploiting me too much. Every day I do work from 9:00 AM to 3.00 AM (night). No Sunday or Saturday's in my life. I do not find time to write a thesis report, cook or eat anything; hence, I eat only once a day by getting food from outside. The important thing is she never does any work. She just sits at home and my results ( I have to send every photo of work)The problem is I tried to talk to her about my situation many times. Whenever I speak about this, she tells me that if you want comfortable life you will not get a good grade since she is going to suggest my performance to the professor while grading. Most of the time she speaks very rudely to me. If I go tell this to my professor or my group leader, they will just inform her to not do this (They cannot understand the pain and harassment I am going through). But, eventually, she will hate me more for reporting to the professor and decrease my grade (She will give me the least grade (German -3.0 or 4.0), with this, I will not be eligible for any of the PhD positions (Minimum requirement is 2.7). I cannot find jobs since my course is pure science; hence, it is extremely difficult to find jobs without the knowledge of German. I cannot bear harresment from my guide and I cannot leave that topic and her and do another thesis since I have already registered for the thesis; hence I cannot do anything now. I have lots of financial problems as well as extreme pressure from my family. I do not know what to do, I have started hating society and the system. I could not be able to find any peace. I am a very hard-working and sincere person, still, people are exploiting me and harassing me. I have decided to not live in this kind of world since I cannot see myself without a job in the future even though I worked so hard.I just want to post it here and see if anyone can help me. I have been thinking that it is easy to find peace by dying. I am being exploited and wanted to end my life.",1

"Urgh, I am so tired! Who else has grandparents who constantly make you feel like shit? I have not been eating that much in the past few weeks, because they are always in the kitchen, full of comments about how much I eat. Like, whenever I see them, they will say something like, ""Oh, are you hungry?You should eat. You barely eat!"" And proceed to list seventeen hundred things I could eat. I am trying my best! Eating is hard for me, and they are not helping. Part of me understands that they are saying it because of concern, but I hate it. Because of that, I have grown kind of insecure about eating around people. I only feel completely comfortable when I am eating alone. And when I am with friends, I often skip meals, because I am afraid that I will eat more than them and they are going to notice and say something about it. Eating",0

I am trying to heal myself, I am trying as hard as I can try and I am doing it because I have this supposedly reasonable expectation that some how this absurd reality I am experiencing could get better if I just keep trudging through these trenches.

"Therapy is so expensive, and it is completely unpredictable if the therapist will even be able to healthily provide for your needs and personality.

Everyone tells you to go to therapy as if its free, even I have done that at times. Every time I crave the thought of therapy and feel like I desperately need it, I think about the price, and I am immediately pulled off.

I finally was going to take the steps in an attempt to improve my mental health by admitting myself to an intensive outpatient program for a few weeks. It would have been 5 days per week from 9-3pm.

I cannot just get another job; between not having my drivers license and social anxiety making references an impossible thing to deal with, my literal only two choices right now are to either keep living this miserable experience or once again live a meaningless one where I lay around and do nothing with my life. I really do not want to die but I am spiraling into the belief that its going to be the only way out of this misery. Its getting worse by the week. I am actually starting to get scared of myself.But tonight, on a whim, I watched a video I took recently, of a moment where I felt truly at peace. I was playing lofi out of a speaker and laying in the grass, watching cars leave after a fireworks show.And I was reminded that its those little moments that I love so much about life. That even after a miserable shift, Ill keep getting to live these experiences if I LIVE.I am still struggling, do not get me wrong. But its things like that that help keep me afloat. I am hoping to either get my drivers license, work up the courage to talk to the HR manager about my anxiety issues (that feels less likely), or start seeing a therapist soon. kind of had a little bit of a turnaround moment",1

"Okay, so to start off, I am a pretty depressed individual. Been mildly suicidal for many years and would rather be dead than live my life. I am aware that I have made my own mistakes in life.&amp;#x200B;The root of my depression lies in the fact that I have a terminally ill dad. I also had severe cystic acne which left a ton of scars on my face, so you can guess how my social life is. Before my cystic acne, I was actually an outgoing and friendly individual, but then after the horrible 10+ years of cystic acne and now their scars, I have become an introverted jerk that does not even like people looking at him.&amp;#x200B;To top it all off, I was studying for jobs before the pandemic began, and now because of that, the exams have all been thrown off schedule for an entire year, and my prep has gone to shit. So I am also jobless.&amp;#x200B;Oh and yes, the aforementioned terminal illness that my father has? I also might possibly have it in the future because I took some tests and I have the factors within me.&amp;#x200B;So currently, since my dad is also off his job because of the illness, and I am jobless, my mom is the sole bread winner of our family. This alone puts so much of stress on me. Most days, I feel like I cannot do shit because of the depression. I feel like all my efforts are in vain.&amp;#x200B;So you can see that I am not exactly a happy person. But all the reasons mentioned above are not why I have come to rant in here. No, that reason is my grandma.&amp;#x200B;I have three grandmas. Sisters. The oldest of them(the current grandma in question), is just that, old. So she is kind of senile. She also cannot hear a thing(we have to literally shout in her ear to tell her something), and she forgets most of everything after some time. I do not even talk with her, I just nod or shake my head when she asks me something because she cannot hear a thing.&amp;#x200B;So first off, she cannot hear a thing, and then when she does hear a thing, she forgets it after a few minutes. So you can see how frustrating it is already, right? Now, she is also convinced that her own sisters(the other two) are thieves, so she is constantly cursing them when she is alone in her room. And since I am at home the whole day, I constantly hear her cursing. This constant cursing just gives me SO much stress.&amp;#x200B;She also has the pains that every old person gets, you know, in the joints, etc. She has intense pain in her left eye socket, for which btw we have taken her to several doctors and tho they have given us vitamins and whatnot, they have said that pain is mostly psychological. Gran ofcourse, does not know any of this, so she constantly asks for medicine, constantly complains of the pain, constantly calls me again and again and again, either to ask for some medicine(which I have given her like ten minutes ago) or to tell me to call a doctor, or to complain how her legs or her eyes are paining.&amp;#x200B;At first, yes, it is pitiful and you feel sad when an old person complains of such pain, right? You do what you can to make that pain go away. But when this thing goes on for months and months and months. When you hear her constantly complaining, constantly cursing, constantly calling your name..... How do you think it feels?&amp;#x200B;Like absolute hell. that is what. And I love her. she is like a second mom to me, she practically raised. So I am in such a dilemma. I feel guilty the whole day because she asks for medicine, but when I say no(because she is already taken them) she starts cursing me too. Calling me selfish, etc. it is makes my blood boil,because I have my own depression killing me on the inside and then there is her on the outside. I sometimes feel like slapping her, because her curses are so nasty. Imagine loving someone but also feeling so angry that you just want to punch them in the face. What moral dilemma that puts you into. How guilty that makes you feel. And since I cannot go out because of my social insecurity thanks to a face full of horrible acne scars, I am at home all day. And she keeps calling only me. Even if my whole family is there, she only calls me. Over and over and over. To repeat the same question(""Did I take my medicine?""). I know it is not her fault. That she cannot control it. But that even worse you know. Because you can even blame them and yet they make you want to kill yourself. So please, any advice? What am I supposed to do? I feel like a jerk all day. Like I am a nasty person.....&amp;#x200B;And what is more, because of dad's illness, he is also frustrated, right, and so he also behaves like a jerk towards everyone(always angry, short tempered, thinks only he is correct, etc) so voila! Another person who is angry at me and insults me all the time but I cannot do anything because he is sick. I have to understand.&amp;#x200B;But who the fuck is going to understand me? Who the fuck is going to understand that I also have depression? That I also feel angry. Whenever I show my anger, the other members of my family guilt me by saying that I am supposed to understand, that those others that I am angry at, are sick, etc. I just wish I would never been born tbh. That I never existed. Then I would not have had to face all these shitty situations. I never even asked to exist. To be born.&amp;#x200B;So please any input is appreciated. Thank you. Some advice please. Because I am seriously losing itvhere",0
"So I was forced to go to residential anorexia treatment 2 months ago by my parents who threatened a conservatorship over me. I have been out for a week and I am extremely depressed. I put on 30 pounds against my will because of the ED so now my clothes do not fit, so I have to get new ones. I hardly have money for food but I still get agonizingly hungry because now I am used to eating. My parents have sent me some money since I got out, I literally had almost no money before and I have spent it on new clothes (oversized, baggy ones to hide my body) and grocery items. I am so depressed I can hardly get out of bed to see my friends because I am ashamed of how I look. I have like zero money and I am not in a head space to work right now. My parents are not giving me more money. I feel so hopeless and helpless I am even considering selling my pet snake because as much as I LOVE her, I could use those extra few hundred dollars to make ends meet. This is so much worse than before I went to treatment. I did not ask for any of this. I feel like my parents ruined my life I am worse after going to treatment",0
"I fell into a deep depression at the beginning of February, right when my partner and I of a year and half moved into together with two other good friends. The transition was especially hard for me because I already had my own tiny studio apartment where I had been living in for three and half years. I knew that moving in would be hard, but it did end up being harder than I expected it to. When my depression would hit when I lived alone, it was easy for me to recluse in my apartment, lay in bed all day and avoid the world as much as I wanted to, but living alone especially during the pandemic was also hard for my mental health. And I knew that moving in with my partner would also have a lot of pros, which still stand today. Its mid July and thankfully that aspect of things have been good. But when my depression hit in February and I moved in with my partner, it was hard for me to hide and recluse myself like I was so used to, so he saw me in one of the most vulnerable and lowest states that I have ever been through. He does not struggle with any mental health issues and did not know just how bad it could get for someone, so he was clueless about how to support me in that state, which made it harder for, because when I am in that state, its hard for me to communicate what it is that I need. He tried and stuck around and is still here with me. I got on medications in May, which have helped. But I still do not feel like myself completely. I work everyday to be more positive because I really do want to turn my life around. But now that I am feeling ""better"", I feel like I have fallen out of love with my partner. I just do not feel the same towards him and I think he can tell. he is not changed at all towards me, he still desires, supports, and loves me just the same. And I am afraid I will not feel the same for him like I did. Before all this, I saw our lives together and now I do not know what I see. I want to love him and be able to reciprocate all the love he continues to give me everyday, because I honestly do not want anyone else. So what I am wondering is, has anyone else had some type of similar experience? Where you feel like you fell out of love and was able to fell in love again? I am being patient with myself because this illness has not been easy on me and I am making sure to put myself first in terms of also finding the love for myself within. Especially when it feels like I will feel this lingering dark shadow above me forever. Would love to hear any stories you might have or advice. Thank you. I feel like I have fallen out of love with my partner",0
"I am getting so frustrated by my situation and I cannot find a solution. I have tried CBT, talking therapy and counselling. They do not work, you can never really talk about your true problems and even if you could they do not have solutions. Really does seem like the only purpose of them is to get you going another day or for you to incriminate yourself. I grew up poor, with a black immigrant single mother (and a white father). I worked to not fall into their trap getting an education. Where I was constantly berated for not acting like a black stereotype. growing up in a neighbourhood where being a drug dealer was equal in respect to being a banker. worked my arse off to not end up as a chav. got myself into a world class university studying a highly respected field (or so I thought). Hated every day of it but I persevered. so many times I wanted to drop out or end my life, might have even done so if I did not get a decent grade. but I got through it, the loneliness, the boredom, the racial abuse. I left with a master's degree. Now I am stuck in a job where I do not get to use any of those skills. Graduated 5 years ago so I cannot even get a job in my field of study. Seeing drop outs and convicts still serving half their prison sentence in the community making more than me working manual labour. while I am here getting fat making pennies working in front a computer. cannot even move jobs because I would just have to work in the same field but somewhere else. I made sacrifices for my education and to be on the 'right' path. my girlfriend left me and 8 years on still cannot find anyone like her. Because I am mixed race I get discriminated by girls I like. Stuck in a dead end job - dead end for me because I do not want to progress these soft skills I use. Before lockdown I made so much progress in the gym even kept it up during lockdown until I had to start thinking about moving up in my career. Now I have to sacrifice many hours of my free time relearning shit I knew when I was a fresh graduate while the other goals I was working on just atrophy. Many times I wish I killed myself in uni now I have to live as half a man. Good looking well educated - worked to hard to be the loser I am today",0
"I have been depressed and suicidal for about a year - I have leaned too much on my mother for emotionel support, and as a resultat I have felt her lose patience with me and use my weaknesses against me in arguments.We had an argument today where she was telling me how unmotivated and childish I am and that I have a victimMentality, and it made me so upset and hurt and feel so hopeless that I said If you hate me so much, I should just kill myselfI did not mean it as manipulation - I really felt that it would be better for me to be dead in the moment, because I just feel I make everyone is life around me miserable and I do not have the strength to change it.I feel awful about this - my mother means well, and she has a lot of stuff to deal with. But I feel like my actions prove my point.I threatened suicide in a fight with my mother, I get blackout drunk and kiss random guys even though I have a boyfriend who loves me - the shame I carry makes it so hard to not to kill myself.How can I make this up to my mother and how do I go on in life without feeling like a toxic burden to everyone close to me? Impulsively threatened suicide in fight on phone",1
The amount of people that want to kill themselves over one single person. I believe in your right to choose when to end your life (as long as you are making the decision willingly and are of sound mind) but wanting to kill yourself because one person does not like you anymore... it seems beyond trivial to me. The kind of unstable personality that would choose to do this does not have the mental depth required to make the decision to kill themselves. Give it a little time before you jump straight to wanting to die. I need an 25+ version of this I think. Cringe,1
"I have decided to end it. it will be sometime within the next couple of weeks. I want to help my friend fix their iPad and start looking at selling and giving away my things. it is been a wild 19 years, cannot deny that there is been good times but sadly the bad outweighs the good and has done what feels like irreparable damage. I am sorry, dad, for not being the child you wanted me to be. I always disappointed you but I hope me running away brought you some relief. It was not even your fault, it is was mostly mine, but your wife is what put the nail in the coffin for me. I have not spoken to you for what feels like forever yet every day I miss you, and imagine what our relationship could have been.I am sorry mum, for making so many years of your life a living nightmare. I never should have taken out my shit on you by yelling and screaming and punching holes in your walls. I never could forgive myself for what I did, even if I eventually showed you that I could change. Your stroke had a massive impact on me, it feels like you were never the same after and who can blame you. I feel so guilty for trying so hard to make you quit smoking, but it is because I cared so much and it was such an easy thing to cling to. I do not know.I am sorry to my sister, I also made so much of our time a living nightmare. You were essentially my mum when dad decided mum could not be in our life when we were kids. it is been amazing watching you grow up to have such a fulfilling life. Who knows, maybe someday I could have been an auntie. I am sorry to everyone else that I just constantly pushed away and shut out if my life instead of being honest and trying to be a good friend. A lot of you did not deserve what I have done.To Toby, you were my favourite cat. When you died it took so much from me. You were there for me more than my actual parents. You were literally my best friend and I am so upset that you suffered through the last moments of your life.To anyone who read this, thank you.

"I am a 16 year old Romaniam boy. Currently i am suffering from anxiety, depressiom and existential crysis. Sometimes i wish to die or to never existed, but not suicide.When i talk to people my age i am often stressed and anxious because they behave differently than i do and often they cannot understand me. When this happens i question myself if there is something wrong with me or if the society does not accept me. I cannot find anyone behaving similar or like me, it feels like i am a stranger, and because of this i avoid people.The only time i feel confortable around people in public is when someone i trust is with me, being there alone makes me feel unsafe and anxious.I cannot see myself alone out there. I do not know what to do.Highschool is very stressfull and annyoing to me, my classmates do not talk to me (only when important stuff i happening), i have 0 friends basically. When i go to highschool i feel so unconfortable that i do not even feel like eating or leaving the classroom !But outside of my own class i have 1 friend and we talk rarely, he is not similar to me at all, but he does understand me like 100% of the time which makes him a valuable person to me (and i am not gay).I do not know what i want to do with my life. I wish to be normal like everyone else but i do not know how. I spend all day home using my PC and smartphone, i am very dissapointed of myself for living such a lifestyle.

"I am 45. Lifelong depressive, absolute failure at everything I ever tried but dogs. Got my first as a pup 12 years ago, rescued 2 more since. One died (aged 18 in her sleep thank fuck) and now I have 2 Shibas - 1 12 the other 13.they are the only reason I have not topped myself but probability suggests they will not be here in a year. I did try an insulin suicide when I only had one, but I panicked about him, rang the fuzz and spent 2 weeks in hospital. It was agony but I was so happy to see my boy again. So much so I rescued another Shiba as a reward for my beloved boy and as a further reason not to try againthe problem with staying alive for your dogs is that they do not live very long and at 12/13 that dark moment is on the horizon. And they truly are my everything. I am asexual and have never been in a relationship and never will. The loneliness is real and insurmountable, but the love of my dogs is very very real. The only thing that keeps me goingbut like I say, they will be dead in a year or two and are irreplaceable.I am a type 1 diabetic so have mounds of ammo to kill myself, trusty old insulin but also I am on the dark web where I get weed and pyschadelics. (These actually make me feel better, so do not blame them). But I can easily get enough smack or meth to definitely finish me off. I did a dummy run last month. Smoked the skag to see if it worked, and as an opioid addict for pain reasons (oxycontin for back pain) it did. So I am all primed for a serious attempt.the problem is that my old dogs are very much alive and they are the only reason I am I am in a bind. Any advice??? Newb do not do social media but minutes away from heroin/insulin overdose, hence new account. And again dogs are the question",1

I can go to work although it is a challenge, but when I am not at work I am in my bed watching true crime shows and crushing candy on my phone. kind of sucks",0

"Hi, I am looking for some words of advice and comfort here.A month ago, during an argument, my boyfriend (24M) revealed to me (22F) that he is suicidal. He was furious to have said it and became upset with me for having brought the truth out from him. I was never under the impression that I acted inappropriately at the time, but over time I realized I disrespected a boundary I had no idea existed. I made a mistake I have so much trouble understanding. And a part of me was relieved that he told me-- I also learned he has been seeing a therapist for a year, but after the argument he told me he was no longer interested in therapy. Since this happened, my boyfriend and I have not seen each other. we have known each other for three years and have dated long distance through the pandemic. We initially continued seeing each other (long distance, zoom and facetime) to play videogames and talk about our days as if nothing was wrong, but my emotions kept ""getting in the way."" But from the beginning of this crisis, he said he could no longer trust me or the relationship because he cannot bear to think about the problem and my fear and sadness are extremely upsetting because they cast doubts on his recovery. I understand where he is coming from and objectively, the nature of an intimate relationship goes against his desire for distraction and levity -- I have accepted this. We have started a two-week no contact break this week. Before then, I did everything I could to communicate my understanding and faith in him and his recovery, even though I cried due to my anxiety about the situation. But he has been so strong and sought out help before-- I must believe he has the courage to overcome this. As I am someone who struggled with depression and some suicidal ideation too, it breaks my heart to know my boyfriend is suffering like this -- and that I only found out now. I know I brought joy into his life, but without ever knowing truly how dark his mind could be, I am distraught that he must have felt disconnected and alone.I deeply understand I am not *the* solution to his problem. I am working through the paralyzing fear of being unable to do anything for him. Again, he only wants distraction now. We are currently on a break to sort out whether he wants to continue in the relationship. We continue to affirm our love and care for one another. As you might understand, the flux of our relationship interacts very poorly with the intense sadness and anxiety about his personal suffering. I do not know whether I should stay or go, regardless of his decision. I am determined to accept what he wants but I am scared if what is to come is a lifetime of not knowing if he is okay. it is an impossible problem and I am just waiting for a sign. I love him so much and can only pray for him to recognize his strength -- to find whatever he needs. My anxiety gets in the way of my seeing signs of hope and reassurance -- he tells me he is keeping himself stable my continuing to see friends and do activities--I trust that is exactly what he needs, it might be just fine to put off the deeper work it might take to overcome his sadness. Really, I might just be terrifying myself for no reason. My therapist and family tell me it will all be okay because he told me about his suicidality. And he did so in some detail. Even though he was angry, I could not help but feel he might be relieved to share his dark thoughts. And I cannot breathe a word of this to his family or friends, because they would make it worse by wanting to talk about this problem with him, when he absolutely does not want to. This also is a bit scary for me, but I can understand why it has to be this way.I know there is not much I can do but manage my own anxiety. I am learning and adapting, and finding strength. I hope he does exactly what he needs and that the outcome of his decision can preserve his happiness. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and I am terrified",1

"I remember learning about Sylvia Plath in school and thinking ""why the heck would she put her head in the oven? That seems like it would be so hot, is she nuts? Must have been a terrible way to die."" *Now that I am almost 30, Sylvia, I get it. I get why you would choose a way to die that would work.* My life has become a life of perpetual sorrow. It seems like every single year it is just something that gets added to the list. Every year I say ""wow this is worse than last year."" I have tried self-help books, manifesting, medication, therapy, and all the other crap to try to get myself out of this depression, but nothing fucking works. that is honestly the truth, my friends. It feels like nothing works. Everywhere I go, I feel I am a nuisance. Every person I talk to, I feel they just respond obligatorily. I have no true friends. I got married and somehow still ended up alone. It just honestly is fucking gut punching to wake up everyday and live this sad, pathetic excuse for a life. I have a kid who is the light of my life, and I do not even have the energy to get up and play with him or take him to the pool or do anything fun. it is like I have become a sloth and I want nothing more than to just stay in bed and do nothing. I have made some seriously great accomplishments in my life. After a stay in the psych ward, I graduated that semester with cum laude from undergrad. While raising a baby with virtually no help from my partner and working full time, I graduated with my J.D. from law school. My grades were not the greatest, but I fucking did it. I got through. I am on my way to be an attorney and honestly, all the I can think is, *I get it, Sylvia.* I am starting to understand why Sylvia Plath stuck her head in the oven",0

"I was pretty much suicidal consistently since 2016. I went through another breakup recently which again made me spiral. Thankfully there was a therapy session right after. She gave me a lot of pointers on how to tackle my trauma of abandonment and neglect and general feeling of loneliness. And I went through so much shit in the past 2 years in my relationships that this session just woke me up from my slumber. Like I am done feeling this way. I am done giving my energy to people who do not deserve it. For some reason I do not give a damn about relationships anymore and the very thought of it exhausts me and now I finally feel free. Like I finally feel like I can live my life and direct energy to myself and I do not owe anyone anything. I do not have to spend time deliberating if I mean anything to anyone. I do not have to obsess and overthink, like I am over everything. I just do not care and I want to take care of myself and spoil myself and for the first time like I actually want to live!! Like I want to live my life not giving a shit about anyone else or what anyone else thinks of me or being desperate for a relationship or some form of Connection.

"I started therapy about two months ago. I have had two sessions since then. If you are wondering why I have had so few sessions, its because I am broke, also my therapist sometimes answers my mails too late so by the time she replies she is fully booked.I was able to schedule an appointment from the website where I found her in the first place, then she gave me her mail address so that is what I used to book my previous appointment. But she always answered too late, and one time she did not answer at all. And, you know, whatever, sometimes people forget things or make mistakes. She is not responsible for answering all the mails from her clients during the day they were sent.And then she did not show up. The way this website works, I do not really know if she knows its me, and the website is complete shit so I do not think I will be able to get my money back.I need help. I really need help, I am going to go insane. I have been trying to get help, and I am going to explode from all the thoughts going through my head and my goddamn IBS and all the other bad stuff that is happening that I cannot handle. I have nobody to talk to face to face. I have a friend I made here and we do talk to each other about our struggles but I cannot use her as a therapist, because she is a friend and not a therapist, and she cannot help me in a way a therapist can.So now I lost the money I saved. It will take at least a couple of weeks before I save enough money to see someone again. I have made a document where I talked about my past and all the dark and heavy stuff that happened to me and people I love, and now I have to start over again. I lost progress and I desperately needed progress.Now I will have to save money, find someone else, book an appointment, open up to them about all the dark and heavy stuff again somehow, have another session about all that stuff and what I expect from therapy and how this stuff is going to work, then I will be where I am right now with this therapist.Goddamn I needed progress. I needed the tools they would teach me, I needed their guidance, now I will have to start all over again. And I am running out of time. Fuck. Damn it. I got stood up by my therapist.",0
"I love my dad a lot. he is the only person I do not feel anxious or awkward around. Unlike my other family members, he is also able to help me when I am going through an episode. The thing is that society shuns socially anxious and awkward people. People who cannot communicate well with others. At work the other day one of my coworkers fucked up and did some damage to a house we were working on. Our boss asked everyone who did it, and the co worker just admitted to it in a joking and also rmpathetically sorry way. My boss just laughed it off. This is a coworker who has good social skills. I have done shit not as bad as what he did with regards to fucking up. If I did what he did, even though they were both accidents, by boss would get mad at me and shout. I have never seen him shout at my co workers. Society shuns socially awkward people. Social workers shun, psychologists and psychiatrists shun, strangers shun, family shuns, preists shun, friends shun, everyone shuns. They do not do it on purpose either. it is just instinct to not interact with someone who makes you feel awkward. But it really hurts nonetheless. I cannot have fun with people or communicate my feelings with people. I am in a hard university program and doing well but I feel like a complete idiot everyone I interact with people. The more socially savvy people can make passive jabs directed at me when they are not happy with my presence or the way I am acting. They blame shit on me all the time because I am an easy target. They do it because I cannot defend myself. Physically I can probably beat up just about anyone, but that is a losing strategy. I just want my dad to find my body so at least one socially savvy person can understand the hurt we go through. Even if that person is the person I love the most. it is fuckedup and I know it. I will never act on it because of my religion, but its what I would do if I was not my religion. I want my dad to find my dead body",1

"Tomorrow's my last shift at a job that had become nothing but a source of anger, frustration, and toxic energy that turned me into a person I do not want to be anymore. I recently went on a family trip and I was actively angry that I had to go back to working there when I got back. A week later I put in my notice. No regrets on getting out of a situation that made me feel like I was going through the motions, like I was just a character in a video game playing out my script until clocking out, like my input or ideas or suggestions were not listened to or ""I agree with you but (other person) said no"".No regrets, that is, other than leaving when I had nothing else lined up after. Now it feels like the only jobs I will ever be able to get are things that I will end up hating just as much. And the career path I would like to pursue is impractical, untenable, unrealistic, and I should just stop fooling myself into thinking it is possible, so I might as well just accept that I am never going to be happy in what I do for a living.I had been telling myself that I needed to get the 900-pound gorilla off my back before I could move on in a healthy way. Nope, you just could not put up with a standard retail job. Get over yourself, your dreams are pointless, just give up now, and put the customer service voice back on.I would been telling myself ""do not leave a job unless you have another job"". Yeah, and you did not ever look for other jobs while you were working because you were too stressed out and exhausted (or more realistically lazy and like to complain) from your current job that thinking about work became the last thing you wanted to do so you would just wallow in it. And now that you are at the exit ramp, you still have nothing to show for it. Why? Because you are fucking lazy and you need to accept the fact that this is all you are ever going to be. Just give up and get back to work.I would been telling myself ""work yourself out of a job so they will either have to promote you or you go somewhere else and do the next step on that ladder"". Even if they did promote you, that just would have kept you stuck there even longer, or if you went somewhere else you would be still doing the same thing you hate. Which is the only thing you are ever going to get paid to do, anyway, so suck it up and put the tags back on.The only thing I have *ever* truly wanted to do with my life, and I mean across all of my years of existence, is to put on a show, make people laugh, and help them forget about their problems for a while. But I am not a good enough actor/writer/comedian/performer/anything to get paid to do that for anyone else, I know I would never succeed trying to start something on my own, and the wild card option I keep toying with is unrealistic (for many reasons), most notably because I am already probably too old to start and I would be even older by the time I was good enough.So I might as well just accept that all I am ever meant to do is suck it up, accept my fate, and go through the motions of living doing something that will never let me be happy. Tomorrow's my last day at my job, I do not have anything else lined up, and I see no hope.",0

I have (32) been on anti-depressants and anxiety meds for 2 1/2 years now and seeing a therapist twice a month. In all honesty it should have been much earlier but just now trying desperately to get a handle on my mental health. I want to talk to my family about it but do not want this to weigh on them or become a burden/worry about me. My wife and BiL (also bipolar) are the only ones who know. How do you tell someone that you do not feel emotions? You do not experience joy or pain. you are just numb. To everything and everyone. You do not want to kill yourself but you do not want to exist. That life has become a cycle of just getting through days. That simple things like getting out of bed are sometimes the hardest fucking thing ever. How do you explain depression to someone that has never experienced these feelings?,0
Found this group by google how I have been feeling for the longest time. Everyday I try to just sleep and stay in bed for as long as I can (way past 2pm) if I get up its for some mundane task or to take a shower. I have barely gone to work in the last few months using every excuse from Covid to just not feeling well/ lying about doing something else. I have all of the sudden just now look forward until around 6pm to justify drinking just to go to sleep and repeat it all over. Over the last few years I have exiled pretty much all of my friends by either just not contacting or making some lame excuse not to see anyone and some of the closest just blowing up on them for absolutely no just reason.. and if I do meet up with someone I feel like I am just glued to my phone and bored with that person - that urge that I do not want to be there or talk its tiring feeling. Its almost like I do not care anymore. I am still fairly young in my late 20s. I have seen a therapist but she is a bit older and I do not know I do not feel like being put on any pills etc - they were useless and just made me even more tired. How do you all force yourself out of bed and to do life? If that made sense? Do I create a schedule?Love to talk to someone that can relate. Sorry for the sporadic typing - this is my first time really writing and trying to understand myself. Which I do not think is possible. Unmotivated and just wasting my days and life.,0
"it is raining hard here and the frogs are out. One got in the house somehow so I scooped him up. He was a little dry, so I got him a little water to help him out. Not sure if he actually needed it, I suppose when it is not raining frogs are not gona be quite so wet. Anyways, I spent a few minutes going back and forth between holding him and trying to comfort him before letting him go and catching him when he hopped away. I imagine it is hard to be calm in the palm of a giant. Those few moments just felt so much more fulfilling than any time with most people. it is such a simple bond and it is not even reciprocated. But it does not need to be. The frog was probably terrified, how could anything not be in the play of a giant? But all I wanted was to calm it, help get it a little water. I felt bad putting it back outside, knowing the world is even more terrifying for it than it is for me, with predators and dangers. So easily this worry and true care for this frog came, where it comes so much more difficult with people. And it makes me think of the world. Of all the creatures out there struggling so hard just to survive, constantly in fear. it is silly I know to be this upset by a frog. But that simple bond made me realise how I really want a much simpler life. I am tired of working. I am tired of being around people. I do not get that connection with people, I never have. I just want to be free to enjoy those little connections without fear, without worry of going to work to make money or things like that. Without having to interact with people in these complex, almost overwhelming interactions that in the end, I do not know why I even bother with. I do not enjoy them, they bring nothing to me and I doubt they bring anything to anyone else. All this for a frog. Feel more connected to animals than people",0

"I am 23, I am 3 credits short of graduating high school. But graduating means nothing to me. In 2015 I attempted to hang myself and failed miserably. My whole life I am constantly dealing with trauma from my childhood, not having a mom, a lack of a father figure. Instead of getting any kind of genuine help I have been thrown into 3 mental hospitals against my will (because of my father). I can say with a full heart that I will kill myself before the year is over. You do not know what its like constantly being bullied for the way I look. I gave up a long time ago. I am not suppose to be here. I want to be free of this life. A life where my scars define the person I will forever be. Hopeless. I am not looking for anyone to tell me things will get better because I know they will not. By the time 2021 is over I will be gone. I will be free of waking up every day and being horrified by my reflection. I have become all the things I told myself as a child Id never become. The little happy kid in me is dead and it ruins me everyday I wake up. I am so worthless. I let down the child in me who was only trying to be free. To be happy. To live a life of meaning. My youth has been wasted away, and Ill never get it back. Wasted youth. The majority of my life has been spent trying to make others happy, doing what others deem necessary for me to do. I want to be free of this vicious cycle of trauma that we are told to live with. I will die with dignity. I will die knowing I did everything I could to hold on just another second. We say suicide is the easy way out, no. It is the only way. Wasted youth",1
"I am a 28 year old woman and I am fucking sick and tired of not being treated like a person... I have had enough... Sometimes I want to fucking throw my phone at a wall when I read some of the shit I see sent to me. I was talking to this guy, he seemed nice.. It was so nice to be able to talk about normal things.. No flirting at all.. Was really amazing actually not being flirted with.. I felt like a person. We talked about the weather, our countries, our pets, real mundane shit and it was nice, we even got to share a bit about our own traumas. He saw a picture of me and then our conversation had to change... He told me.. No.. WARNED ME how now that he is seen what I look like that it is going to be hard for him not to ask for nudes or get thirsty as he said it.. I told him to just talk to me how he always did those few days, just normal stuff it is obviously not hard and that I am a person too. Then he actually said and I quote ""yeah but that is before I knew you were attractive"".... He had the fucking AUDACITY to be offended by me saying our conversations are being ruined now because he could not control himself. So basically I cannot get the basic human respect of a normal conversation if someone sees how I fucking look? That makes me feel like I am nothing... I feel so fucking stupid for thinking this person was nice.. I have sat here genuinely upset by it for two days now.. When I explained that I should be the upset one and to leave the conversation there then he never once apologised. I am sick of feeling like an object... I am sick of being nervous when a guy talks to me.. I am sick of being scared incase they see my face.. I am sick of being scared full stop!! I deserve fucking respect!! I deserve to be treated how I treat you!!! I deserve to be heard when I fucking say no!! I have feelings and I am fucking sick and tired of all these thirsty fucking assholes who cannot accept it when they are wrong or acting creepy. I do not give a fuck if you are offended when I tell you that you are being too flirty...I am offended you would not listen to my no in the first place. Do I honestly have to hide my face just to get a normal conversation? I hate this shit!! Sometimes I feel like I want to hide away... I do not want to talk to anyone... Its already hard for me to make friends, I have to put up with this crap on top of it? I am tired... I am tired of not being treated like a human being. I have dealt with alot of years of past sexual abuse, physical abuse and I am a rape survivor of fucking several times.. So this shit just makes me feel even more worthless, my thoughts go back to how I used to think when I was abused... ""I am only here for his pleasure, it does not matter how I feel, what I want, I am just here for sex, that is all I am good for"".... It puts me in a really bad place. I do not know how to deal with this stuff anymore.. I know everyone has to deal with it, and it is just how the online world is but I feel like I have to ignore everyone just incase and I do not want to have to do that! it is not fair.. Why is this shit so scary..... I do not know who to trust. Do I not deserve some respect too?",0

"28 male here. This is something I never felt comfortable about talking to anyone about it in person as I do get emotional about it too much. I have had suicidal thoughts over the years, never brought myself to go through with it but they still linger in the back of my mind. First time was when I was in year 10 at school. All through my young life I was bullied physically and verbally. By that point I just felt completely shit about myself, felt that I had no friends, did not deserve any friends and did not deserve to live anymore. Ended up writing a letter stating how I was feeling and passed it onto one of the guys in my class. Later on that day I was on the top floor of the school walking towards the balcony area under the skylight. My intention was to climb over the barrier, jump from what would have been in effect 6 stories up and aim for the metal plate on the bottom floor.I never got there as my English Teacher called me into her classroom for a chat. Turned out she had been informed about the letter I wrote and she gave me one big pep talk which helped me to feel a bit better about myself and snap back to reality. She never knew that she had just stopped me from jumping.A few years later after I turned 19, I went into the Army. Started developing problems with my knees during basic but managed to complete it. Got to trade training and was really struggling due to my knee problems along with other things. Eventually it got to the point when each time I walked into the accomodation block and looked up to the top floor balcony, I just kept imagining myself hanging from the balcony with paracord around my neck.The knee problems continued and after a few months, I was told that I was going to be recommended for a medical discharge by the doctor. I was completely devastated by this as it was the first job I ever had and I was now going to lose it. I broke down in the medical centre and had to get picked up by one of the training staff from the camp who did provide some comfort. Later on I smuggled a large bottle of Jack Daniels into my room (no alcohol allowed in the block btw) and my intention was to down the whole thing in an attempt to kill myself that way. Again, never went through with and ended up sharing it with some of the lads when we had a trip to the beach.Left the Army in 2014 and since then, I have had a logistics job, done an apprenticeship in Fabrication and Welding and now employed as a semi-skilled fabricator. So been working on myself a lot other the years. But every so often, I have felt crap about myself and hating myself for my past decisions. And on those occasions, a voice pops into myself telling me ""why carry on? Just grab the length of rope you got in the car, go into the woods round the back of your house and just go hang yourself!"" But, there is another voice, a feminine one telling me ""no do not that. you are still doing alright. Just keep going"" and that one always wins.I have no desire to end myself as I know I have still got plenty of opportunities and time to sort myself out and better myself. But I just keep getting haunted by these dark thoughts on occasions and they bring me to tears every time. But somehow I have been able to just stuck it up, dust myself off and soldier on day by day. Dark thoughts from long ago haunt me",0
"I (25F) struggle with depression/anxiety for years and for the most part of it suicide thoughts too (never acted on them tho).All of this is mostly because I am just lost on what to do with my life, not some major trauma (If you do not count the bullying i experienced younger).I just cannot seem to find anything interesting to do. I never wanted nor want to marry/have kids and I have zero hobbies because nothing catches my attention. Even simple things like music/tv/games keep my attention for a short period of time and then I am bored again.That have been a hell for me because I do not seem to be able to either work, in fact I find work the worst part of being alive.I do not even find people interesting to form friendships/relationships. Had a few friends while at school but did not keep in contact bc I do not want to talk to them, it makes me bored. Had a few people flirt with me but they just seemed way too much for me to handle. I am ashamed to say this but I do not even want to have sex, in fact I cringe like a 5 year old.Even travelling is not something for me, I just do not care about the ""beauty"" of this shithole and seeing other places or whatever. It feels like I am from a different planet most of the time.I just want to die because everything seems weird, fake and uninteresting. What if I do not have any dreams?",1
"Last week I basically cut my arm and mulled over digging the knife into my stomach, before opting to just make a long mark across my hip. Tonight I am romanticising the idea of suicide in the simplest way necessary, whatever that may be. I fear ending my life tomorrow",1

i always knew that it would be expensive but i just saw the actual digit and idk if i want to burts out laughing or just cry. i was in a rather bad place mentally when i saw those digits and it kind of made me feel like I am alone and no one really genuinely cares. its just hopeless. something just does not feel right about the whole thing. feel like it depressed me even more. what a world just found out the price range of mental health service in my southeastern asia country,1
"I say this all the time but why cannot I ever muster the balls just for once? One, no, possibly 2 people would somewhat care for me dying for a few days, then they would move on. that is it. That simple. But even if I thought this through, why cannot I bring myself to kill myself? I am never going to be loved. Never. I have no talent, nothing that shows that I am smart, or athletic. I am not handsome, or tall, or likeable too. I am just me. Simple old self loathing pathetic me. Why cannot I kill myself already? 2 people might be bummed out, but it probably saves other peoples time after I die, not having to meet me to hassle them. I am too much of a hassle for anyone, which is why I either do not have friends, or they avoid me. Just fucking end it, Ill be lucky, same as those who would ever meet me. Fucking kill me. I am worthless. I can be replaced. The world is overpopulated anyway. What more is 14 years to a different family? Probably more than me, but I am basically nothing. Nothing. Just an empty she will with nothing to show for it. Why cannot I just kill myself?",1
"(Starting my senior year of college)&amp;#x200B;September 2017: body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).&amp;#x200B;December 2017: after 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.&amp;#x200B;January 2018: After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.&amp;#x200B;March 2018: I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.&amp;#x200B;April 2018: I am at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that. &amp;#x200B;August 2018: Decide I am good and that I do not need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I did not see. T-boned a taxi. &amp;#x200B;September 2018: Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you were not on Zoloft, your jaw would not have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""cannot leave this earth"" in tears.&amp;#x200B;October 2018: meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend. &amp;#x200B;April 2019: I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.&amp;#x200B;May 2019: Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day. &amp;#x200B;September 2019: I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up. &amp;#x200B;October 2019 - January 2021: Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid did not make things any easier, but whatever.&amp;#x200B;February 2021: I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that is the reason I cannot perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day. &amp;#x200B;March 2021: I go off of Wellbutrin. &amp;#x200B;\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June. &amp;#x200B;\- - - - - - - - - - - End of June 2021: I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw did not click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral. &amp;#x200B;\*\*\*July 2, 2021: I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed (I am at my parent's house here). I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I do not cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently, but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case, and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work, and the rest of the family is at our vacation house, so I was home alone. &amp;#x200B;July 3 2021: I decide to book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18-holes from the tips here at our home course, with a 33 (-3) on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine, and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in college/throughout highschool that I will not get into. I have played golf my entire life. \- - - July 4 2021 (today): I wake up, depressed again. Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything. I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I am unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really do not know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out, though there are bullets in the magazines. I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I am really having a tough time here man. I do not know what to do."" 10:24am July 4 2021 I hit ""post"" here on Reddit, then grab my keys and head into town for my habitual coffee. 26 y/o male - Getting very close - scared myself for the first time and unsure of if it is only a matter of time before I go through with it",1

I am lying in bed wondering why I struggle to do things like brush my teeth or throw away the trash and decide to google it when I came across [this]( are-not-lazy-you-could-be-stuck-on-the-impossible-task/) article talking about ""the impossible task"" and it felt so good to be seen but also to read about why doing things like ""listening to your favorite song"" or ""scheduling time with a friend"" does not help AT ALL for some people. The solutions are not the best - I cannot hire people and I do not have anyone I trust to help - but its so rare to find articles where people understand that self-care does not make depression easier and I had to share it with someone. I just learned about ""impossible tasks"" and it feels good to be understood",0
"Almost called a helpline because I am so overwhelmed. My breaths got heavier and my body was so weak I could barely curl up. Sat inside a walkin closet because I felt like I am too small to matter or something like that. I wished a human being would pick up as soon as I dialed in, but I know there are probably a lot more having worse problem than I do. I do not really have the guts to do it, just constant thoughts of random scenarios of me dying.Dealing with a bot, pressing numbers and being on hold when you are at your darkest moments sucks. could not wait, I turned off my phone, cried myself to sleep in that walk-in closet.

"My brother is like my best friend. We are close enough in age that we always were together. Before his depression hit, he stayed at my house often and my daughter and him were very close. 3 years ago his depression hit hard and he kind of just dropped off the face of the earth. We did not know how to deal. It took 6 months of him dodging our calls and texts with the guise of being to busy with work and his PhD for us to call him out. He said he just needed time. Then the pandemic hit. We forced him to get help recently. He is now back home and starting to adjust. How do I help him through it?

Basically during a discussion I was repeatedly insulted during by people who disagreed with me but when I get angry and insulted people back I am banned from the sub and suspended by old account. It feels really shitty to essentially be ganged up on and kicked out of a community where I had been nothing but polite. The whole discussion was just over if Transgendered is actually grammatically correct to say. I guess the mods did not like that I said technically it was so is not an insult. Now I am banned after I was the one fending of all the insults. It makes me feel so alone. All I can think is nobody wants you anywhere. Nobody wants at all. All I can think about is taking all my meds and every pill I can find in my house at once. Feel suicidal over internet bullying like a child.,0

Its amazing the way we see the world when were little. We cannot wait to grow up and think its this beautiful magical place where we can do and be anything and live a long happy life. Only to grow up and realize how disappointing life truly is. I do not ever want to have kids. I cannot imagine bringing another human being into this world that could feel the way I do? I would not want my own child to suffer. Its so heavy having to deal with these thoughts. I remember when I was little and could not wait to grow up,0

I am just tired of trying jobs, and relationships and moving to different countries to try to find a purpose. I gave myself until the end of the year but I do not think I can make it. I feel so much pain and I do not care anymore if my family or friends will be sad. They were not there for me when I needed. I think I will take my life because life took everything that I was.

I was a loner in school and did not make any friends, I sat by myself everyday at lunch and never had anybody to talk to. My dating life is the same way, since I never really had friends I never got the chance to talk to any girls either. I have never dated a girl or been in a relationship with one. I am 23 and live by myself, and honestly, I have a pretty good life. I am responsible, independent, have money saved up, and I always have a job. I am doing really well for myself, especially for my age. It would just be nice to have somebody to reach out to or some people to hang out with. I would also like to start dating but I have no idea how to meet girls, especially when you have no friends. I have just been going about my life the last few years but I am starting to get really depressed. I do not want to be alone like this 20-30 year's from now, and it seems like now that I am out of school and working it is even harder to meet people. The only time I meet new people is at work. I know I obviously need to make friends, but how? I play my guitar, go fishing, cook, and I also like to read. I know what I need to do i just do not know how to do it...like how does somebody who has zero friends just starting making them? And how can I start getting in the dating scene?

"10 years ago, I was a functioning teenager. One day, during school, a nervous break down took 10 years off my life.10 years in isolation. For 10 years, life stood still. Friendships faded, relatives gave up on me, and every waking moment became another battle to maintain my own sanity.All it took was the love of a girl to bring me out of it.My family could not believe it. I felt unstoppable. Mountains became molehills, the impossible, became possible, and gradually I pulled myself back from the brink and back out into the world.I got my drivers licence, I started going to the gym, I took a course in Medicine. For the first time in years, I was happy... ...but everything had changed... so much time had passed. My school years were finished. All of my friends had grown up and moved on... and the realisation that I had lost my teenage years had sunk in.I felt like I would been hit by a truck. I fell to my knees on the middle of the road and psychologically saw my heart smash into a million pieces...I slowly reached down and grabbed a handful of the shards in attempt to put them back together... before dropping them completely...""it is okay...""

"The person I have loved for 4 years who has broken my heart before did it again a month ago. He just lost feelings for me for the second time and I feel so worthless and like I am never going to feel as happy as I did with him. The last time it happened i spiraled into a depressive period that lasted 2 years. Then I met him again and this time we were together for 2 years and he just broke it off and wants nothing to do with me. I fuck every relationship up with my insecurities and self hatred and I do not blame him for not wanting to be around me. I feel sick, have not eaten more than a few bites a day for a whole month. I do not know how I am ever going to feel that happy again and knowing he did not feel the same is killing me. I just want to disappear and erase myself from the earth. I am completely alone in a country that is not my own and I do not have anyone to talk to. I cannot feel like this again. I cannot sleep I cannot work I cannot do anything except think about how he thinks of me now, like something hes glad he got rid of.

"My partner of just under 2 years broke up with me a month ago and started seeing a colleague from work the day we broke up. I invested so much into the relationship, constantly dealing with emotional abuse from her, constant suicide threats (she actually attempted it at one point and I managed to stop it), supported her with her counselling sessions, and generally tried my absolute best to make her happy. I did not realise how much my depression had creeped back up on my as I was too focused on trying to make her better. My grandad passed away a few months before the breakup, which exasperated everything, and I was reaching out for support from her that just was not there. After the breakup I have sunk to the lowest I have ever been in my entire life, I was hospitalised last week after coming close to the edge (quite literally) but the suicidal thoughts are still in the back of my mind. The point is, I know that the relationship was not healthy for me, but I cannot let go, its like she took half of me with her when she split, leaving a she will of what I used to be. I am trying so hard to keep it together for the sake of my family but I simply cannot let go of the longing for her back, which I know is crazy after everything she is done. Has anyone else suffered this bad after being left by someone like this? Suicidal after partner with Borderline Personality Disorder left me for someone else",1

I am not like that now but I find myself.... Slipping into the old meI was on a walk with my roommates about 2 days ago and I was just talking about science because I thought it was cool, but I guess for some reason she was telling me that it is not true and that it is a theory and stuff. I do not want to call her stupid or anything, but she has a disorder where her mental age is that of a kid. So she likes to act smart even if there is proof that it is right and she is wrong. it is her own thing I guess.But anyway I... Slipped into my old self.... I started being a dick and going out of my way to prove her wrong... And it... eventually hit me... And I have not talked much in two daysFriday morning (I think) I was up early (1:00ish) and I went to a bridge... I stood there for about 30 minutes... thoughts rushing though my head. Then I went home at like 3:00 since I have not been able to sleep. So I decided to wake my roommates (her and her boyfriend) and I opened up... And that is something I never did. I told them everything that was going on, about who I used to be... And the part that echos through my head... Is when she said something and the way my mind saw it was like... Kind of pitty in a way... And I got furious... I grabbed my shoes and I threw them against the wall. Then I stopped myself...I eventually went back to sleep... And I ended up crying a good portion of the day. I think my roommates thought I was asleep because they never checked on me. I eventually did fall asleep. Then I woke up around 8:00 and I went to find them. Maybe they were doing something. They were outside walking around playing Pokemon Go.I walked with them and I made some comments that... Old me would say... So I shut up... That was around 11:00 and it is now 3:00 for me... And I keep having that rushing thoughtIf I kill myself who would care? I feel like I do not want to live with guilt and PTSD for things I have done... I keep thinking... I have a plan and stuff to... I... do not know what is stopping me.... that is the odd part... I do not have biological parents I know, I only have adopted parents, who do not really care. My mom says ""if you kill yourself, we will be sad but we will not be broken"" and that hurtsI've eventually come to the conclusion that I do not like my roommate because she reminds me of a lot of things that...

"I feel so lonely, I want others but the more they want me to more scared I get and pull away and the more independent I become. However secretly more then anything I want someone to just come along and see my 16 year old vunerable ass self and just take control of my whole life. I have never had a connection with anything for very long, I guess if someone takes control of everything it means I get all that love and comfort and feeling of being cared about without that connection, and I can just being someone is thing.

I have never been fully diagnosed. But half a year ago I was still sick but skinnier since then now i gained like 7kg which does not seem much and i can just work it off but i keep eating and i never was really suicidal but now I am actually considering, i know it seems strange but i feel this huge self hatred for the fact i cannot seem to control my intake anymore and that makes me so crazy and sad, because i know i can just lose it but i cannot seem to do it and it feels like i lost my mind. I feel like this is such a rude reason to attempt suicide because others seem to have it harder and i should be grateful, which i am. however, this is keeping me from living like i want to and be the person i desire to become. the problem is that i have to eat everyday but i cannot without feeling extrem guilt and hatred while eating more? i feel out of control and it makes me not take care of myself, because i do not want to shower due to my body. I habe a BMI of 20 which is normal but i feel morbidly obese. i know i might cone across as rude, i do not intend to be my eating disorder is making me suicidal",1

"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out",0
"I spent 2 hours writing a post on here until my phone glitched and deleted it all. Then I realized I was over sharing &amp; decided not to type it all out again. It was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away, 2 days before his 1 month birthday. He stopped breathing in his sleep, spent 9 hours at ER &amp; then passed away in my husband &amp; Is arms. I thought I was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. I was told prior to conceiving him (and after 4 miscarriages) that I had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. I found out two days before Mothers Day 2020 that I was having him &amp; I named him after Gabriel the messenger of God. He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. I wish every day I was the one who died instead of him.I am only 20 years old, yet I feel as if I have been through so much. I feel like God is punishing me in my life and I can never be happy. I do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. I cannot eat, I am always tired, I am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.Every night I fall asleep to images of what I think he would look like now. I am trying to conceive again to no avail. I want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him, and my body will not cooperate regardless. I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for anyways.He saved my from a severe eating disorder &amp; addiction. He made me grow up and turned me into a woman. I moved out, I got my shit together, my husband and I got married so my baby could have a happy home.I will never get to see him take his first steps, say momma for the first time, get to give him his first taste of sugar. I was so excited to take him to the beach, I bought a swimsuit that was several sizes too big so he could wear it in the summer. Its in his closet with the tags still.I sleep with his onesies in our king size bed. I wish it was him instead . I do not know why I am posting this, I have had Reddit for a long time and have never made a real post. Maybe I am looking for people to relate to or maybe this is a cry for help. I do not want to die but I want something to live for and I want a sign that my baby is okay &amp; watching over me. I wish I knew for sure. I think this whole experience has made me more religious because I know he was too pure and perfect to go anywhere else other than heaven and I hope one day I will finally be okay &amp; get to see my boy again. If anyone knows how I can move on or find some peace I would love to hear it. Thank you for reading this &amp; best of luck on your journey to happiness. I have not found mine yet but hopefully I will feel that joy he gave me again. TW: I cannot get over the death of my baby.",0
"I think about suicide every fucking day, I should not have been born. It really does break my heart to say that, but this life are not worth living. Alcohol takes some pain away and I can actually feel good on occasion I like to drink to ease the pain of being ugly",0

"Every time I open up and actually try talking to someone, I feel like it was a horrible mistake and I should have never been honest or allowed myself to be vulnerable. I struggle with rejection, fixate on what is wrong with me, and then I question the motivation of anyone who actually wants to spend time with me. What do they gain from this? Is it simply pity that motivates them? I think the reason I feel so disgusted with myself (part of it anyway) after I share my feelings with people is that I have basically blown my cover and revealed myself as being horribly insecure, unhappy, and unstable making me about as unappealing as possible to be around. it is a cycle of despair; I feel alone, reluctantly confide in people, and time after time, watch those people disappear. I return then to this fixation on my flaws and ultimately, arrive at the conclusion that I need to suffer in silence or at best, in anonymity. How do people live like this? A feeling of overwhelming shame and disgust for being vulnerable",0
"Everyone around me is happy. I made a life choice to try and bring some happiness to those I love around me and now I am a big depressed mess. Every time I go to talk to someone about what I am feeling the conversation starts with how happy they are to be in a better place and thanks me for being apart of that. Knowing what they have been through and yes doing all I could to make sure they get to a better place, how can I ruin that? How can I tell them that their happiness came at a cost and every day I sit here sucking down all the crappy feelings. I know they would want to help me but its not easy to ask for knowing it will effect them in negative ways. Want to just hide",0
"(Male)Everyday is the same. I do not want to wake up.If death is like dreamless sleep, I am in. I am the joke of the family, a verbal punching bag. I go to work, come home, sleep. On my days off I jus distract myself however I can.I am a talented musician, I can make beautiful music but its not enough. I write poetry to process emotions but its all so sad. I want the cycle stop. The only thing keeping me here is the fact there might be something after this. I do not want anything. I have no love life, no friends, my family is disgusting and broken. I have started self harming again (I stopped when I was 15)- I am now 20.I have said Ill kill myself when I am 22, unless I have found someone to love. That gives me a year and a month. But I do not think I can love anymore, the women I talk to either leave or its apparent that there is no connection. I do not really connect to anything except my music. Even that is not good enough for me to be proud of. Everything hurts. There is no point. Iwanttodie.",0
"Life sucks. I work hard 5-6 days a week. I have had a lot of anxieties since I was a child and never had many friends growing up because maybe people thought I was weird for being so shy and timid due to all my anxieties. My home was very hard growing up. My dad was hardly home either working or at a bar coming home very late and drunk. My mom used me as a dependent and still does which is exhausting. Keep in mind I am (33 f) years old. My family bullied me physically and emotionally growing up. Calling me all kinds of names and that I could not ever do anything. I have had very little friends and have been hurt by friends and even family down the road. It is almost impossible for me to trust people. I feel so unloved and so Insignificant and small. Every time I have always tried to do the right thing or do good, something has always come my way to destroy it. I cannot even look forward to anything anymore because I do not trust anything good will happen. I have gotten so used to things crumbling in front of me. I wake up most days angry at the fact that I woke up and that I want to end my life but am too much of a coward to do so. I guess I just need to finally bite the bullet and do it...... that is all folks If I did not wake up tomorrow, no one would care",1
"Depression(majordepressivedisorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act.I know that this is a very sensitive topic and I am very open for corrections, additional knowledge and ideas if ever.Before, I somehow associated depression with sadness. I mean, with the lack of knowledge, I used to think that sadness and depression are quite synonymous. But it is a big No No. Based on an article I read, sadness is defined as a normal human emotion. We as a human being tend to be ""sad"" ""disappointed"" ""downcast"" over a specific reason but eventually when we have already adjusted on the situation our sadness remits. While on the other hand, depression isanabnormalemotional state, a mental illness that affects our thinking, emotions, perceptions, and behaviors in pervasive and chronic ways. ( Unlike sadness, depression does not easily elapse until treated just like any other illnesses. What can we do to help people suffering depression?Convince them to seek medical help.Consulting a psychiatrist is not shameful. Consultations might be a little pricey but there are still foundations or psychiatrists who offers affordable or sometimes free consultation. Be a good listener. Rather than giving them random life advises it is better to just sit there and let them feel that you are always available to listen. Never force them to open up. And also, avoid using statements such as ""Cheer up"", ""forget about it"" ""It will pass"" and etc. because this will not help. Make them feel that you actually understand them. Again, the situation that they are in does not just ""pass"" or ""wear-off"", it is not a phase but an illness.Give them hope through God. Besides on their Mental health, they also might need spiritual help. Pray for them and let them know that we all have God at our back. Ask them to participate mass, worship sessions or bible groups.I am alarmed as some of my friends are actually experiencing it and I really have no idea on what to do or what to actually say, because I know that there is no amount of words that can actually ease the pain they are feeling. The best thing I can do, is to listen and make them feel that they still have that someone who actually cares for them when they feel that they do not matter anymore.To you, it is okay to feel that way. I know that things might be unbearable but never lose hope. Someone out there actually loves you so much. Please continue fighting. This world might be cruel at times but still remember the happy days and the people who actually makes the world lovable. there is hope.Better days are coming. let us claim it. Depression",1
"Hey r/depression. Back to vent here once again. I went through a stretch where I have been doing better at handling my emotions via a few methods like taking a quick second to think of 5 things I can see, 4 I can hear, etc. (its crazy how much that is helped me in day to day life), but I have recently fallen back into patterns of negative thinking that are becoming increasingly debilitating. Whenever I am talking in a large group of people, a good example of this kind of situation would be eating dinner with coworkers, friends, etc., I find myself fading. I think the proper term for this phenomenon I am trying to describe is depersonalization, but I find that fading describes the feeling much more accurately. Ill be talking with someone one second and the next its like I have become more focused on my thoughts than the conversation and thus stop processing the words I am hearing, like I am just zoning out. Big deal right? Everyone does that. The strange part is that I am not even thinking when I fade, I just feel numb. The words I hear start sounding like a foreign language and I have existential feeling as if I am playing a game and the person in front of me does not actually exist. Everything just turns to shapes and noise. Like the world around me is literally blurring and fading away in front of me. Its hard to describe, but there is almost a feeling of fear that washes over me when I fade. Its scary to feel and recognize yourself slipping away. Eventually I just come back and ask the person I am with what they just said to me, but its very jarring whenever this randomly happens. (I say random, but these fading events are usually preceded by negative thoughts) It all just feels fuzzy.",0
Society is against people on the autism spectrum and mental health issues and psychological issues. we are surrounded by a bunch a fucking nazis. They blame us for everything and say everything is our fault because they are trying to destroy us psychologically because they want us to kill ourselves. it is just psychological warfare because society and the governments hates people like us. I get extremely angry and suicidal because I am surrounded by a hateful society,1
"I am not sure if anyone here has felt this way, but I feel a sort of existential depression that is not a result of lacking or wanting things. On the surface, I feel like I have everything that anyone could ever want. I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school, I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, I would feel nothing but the phantom pain. I am bound to this worthless body and by the obligations I have towards the people in my life, and I cannot even fathom them ever understanding my plight. No one will. I am trapped. An outlet for my personal feelings.",0
"I should start by saying that I know I have a blessed life. My parents are still together and love me and my siblings unconditionally. I live in a developed country where there is no war. My parents paid for all my college and I was a great student. I got a job 1 month after graduation and never lost it.All of this just makes me feel shittier about the absolute mess that is the inside of my head.I worry about my mother dying on a daily basis. she is a workaholic with a terrible autoimmune disease. When I was younger my grandmother told me I needed to force my mother to go to the doctor otherwise she was not going to go and I was going to let her die. she is been going lately. And that is all the more worrying because I know that means she cannot handle it by herself anymore. Despite working hard all her life, she also realised this year she will never be able to afford to move to a house with any of the things she is always wanted for us. She often cries saying that she wishes we did not live in this cramped apartment, even though me and my siblings are fine with it. My heart breaks for her and I cannot do anything about it. My grandmother had several strokes these last two years. She stayed with us until it was impossible for us to keep her here. She went to live with my uncle and was mistreated by them. she is now in a nursing home and cries every time I talk to her on the phone. She has lost most of her ability to speak but her brain is still OK so she gets incredibly frustrated at her body and her situation. I want her to keep living but at the same time I think about how I will off myself before I am ever in the same situation as her.I am in my late twenties and I have had anxiety and depression since I can remember. I never did well socially. I am an average-looking person and I am intelligent and funny in that sarcastic way so I did have a few admirers (mostly of the creepy kind) and some superficial friends but I was also the forgettable person. In high school, the group of people I walked home with made plans in front of me without ever inviting me. They did not even pretend to be sorry about it. This is also my fault. I act nice and I am a people-pleaser because I do not like confrontation as it makes life harder but I never really care about anyone. I do not miss people when I am not with them. I never get texts and I barely have any phone numbers on my phone. Just my very close family. I have never kissed or dated anyone. At the same time, I am so incredibly lonely because I cannot connect with anyone that I often cry myself to sleep over it.At work, I am regarded as a high-performer, despite the fact that I have recently slept entire mornings/afternoons when I should have been working, now that I am WFH. I just lie through my teeth during the morning stand-ups. My coping mechanism is just shutting down and sleeping so that is what I do. It sometimes gets to a point where I cannot tell what is reality or dream. I have a very stressful job. I am doing the work of 6 people since the team was reduced and then all the more senior people left. The previous knowledge the team had was also lost so I struggle to figure it out by myself. This job is totally unrelated to any of my majors (2, that I took just because I did not know what I wanted to do) and it is a meaningless, ok-paid, dead-end job. I have looked for other things but there is nothing. I feel completely trapped in this job, my parents house where I cannot make any decisions but cannot move because I cannot afford to, and perpetually worried about my family. I look into the future and I just see the same or worse. And each day, I get more tired of this faade. Last year, I almost opened the car door and threw myself in the middle of the highway. I have been thinking about this more and more frequently. I now think about this every day. I am just wondering what the point of continuing with this is. I live through all of this just so I can have maybe one day per month or less where I get to do what I want to do and to be happy. I cannot bear the thought that I will have to live another 40+ years of this. I do not have the courage to off myself directly but throwing myself off a cliff, a bridge or in the middle of traffic sounds wonderful. I just want peace in my head. I feel trapped",1
"tonight I do not want to live anymore. I have no intentions of hurting myself and know enough about psychology to understand the lies depression can tell us to push us to the edge. I know self-harm, however tempting it is, is harm that self-loving me would not let pass, and I know she is the one to listen to, she is the part of me that I elected president of the big decisions club.But it does not change the fact that tonight I do not want to live. It does not change the fact that I do not want to wake up tomorrow. I wish I could just check out of my life for a little while, take a vacation from the pain in my body, from the pain in my brain and in my heart. From all the fucking culpability. Forget about how my pain pains my loved ones. Or how I feel ungrateful feeling like nobody helps me. I am frozen, petrified in this neverending depression but nobody calls that psychologist and take an appointment for me. Nobody comes and help me clean my place because I just cannot. Nobody just takes me for a drive to the countryside so I can experience real silence and feel like I can finally breathe. Nobody actively does anything, takes control of any part that I try to grasp at but fail.I am invited over everywhere though. Come fit in our lives for awhile. Experience how it is to be alive, have a life, do things. I know you have sensory issues and that right now feeling like shit like you do, just a whisper is sometimes too loud, but hey whenever you FEEL BETTER and want to come by my busy life, just tell me. Whenever you feel like you can take in how I live, please come see me. Just how the fuck? Is this how it is? I feel utterly, completely alone. Surrounded by suggestions of activites, by invitations, by 'just come by and we will have a family BBQ with 4 different people there' when I have trouble being with my fucking self tonight. When I have enough trouble deciding what to eat that I decide not to eat. When all I need is someone just passing by and deciding everything for me for an evening. 'What makes you feel really good and then let us do that tonight' type of deal. I do not even dare to ask, because how entitled am I to ask someone to put their life on hold for me for an evening, for a weekend, for a bit? To take me by the hand like a kid. To do things for me, a grown-ass adult. They have their own lives to figure out. So many things to do around their house, alot of projects, plans, obligations. Their hands are full with their own plate, and here I am whining because they will not take mine for an evening. Ungrateful, ungrateful.I know a diary would be a better recipient for the content of my bag tonight, but maybe a stranger telling me that they feel me, and that a burrito style hug is all I deserve, maybe that would make me hope that tomorrow will be about burritos and silence and will make me go to bed wanting to see the next day, just a little bit. I am okay, but",0
"I might vent a lot, but mostly I do not want to feel alone tonight even tho i am Can someone please talk to me?",1
My brain is so foggy and its hitting me that my life is ultimately meaningless. Nothing matters if you think about it. Were all going to die sooner or later. I cannot imagine living with this feeling much longer. I do not know how I am still alive. Nothing really matters,0
"Hello everyone,I rarely post on Reddit but.....I have nowhere else to go. I have talked to my selected friends but all your inputs are important. I would like to warn everyone this may have religious talks and depression....yeah....like that.....I have a bestfriend of 20 years. This year she will be getting married to the love of her life. I am genuinely happy for her. I really am. Here is the story: My bestfriend got engaged last January 1. She is currently living in United Kingdom, have a wonderful job and loving Fiance. After the engagement, she told us and her closest friends and family that they will wed next year July of 2022. So I was really ecstatic of hearing such wonderful news, at last she will settle down and create a family of her own. She told me that she wants me and our other bestfriend to be there at her wedding, we are three. we have been bestfriends since High School. I got fired up to save a lot of money for plane ticket and pocket money to be with her on her special day. Since I live in Asia, and the cost when you go to UK will cost a lot since our salary here is like x10 lower than what people earn in the western countries.&amp;#x200B;Til one time, she suddenly asked me if I could ask my Uncle who is a priest if Cohabitation is a sin. I asked her like why? She told me she and her Fiance wants to live together, because living in separate houses traveling back and forth every weekend is very tiring for the both of them. I told her if they want to live together without tying the knot yet is not a big deal. If that will help save them gas and transportation allowance, then go. But she told me she is looking for answers and admitted they are in abstinence from sex for how many months now. She felt guilt doing pre-marital sex, and she always seeks answers from God. Asking for signs and that. There is nothing wrong with that, I am a religious person myself but I do what I do. I know my limits. We have this saying in our country: ""God have mercy on us, man has their doing."" When I talked to my Uncle who is a priest and asked him about Cohabitation, he just straightly answered that: Cohabitation is a sin. And I told my bestfriend about it and she contemplated about it. And I know she is been asking a lot of people and even religious leaders in her country. And most of them told her there is nothing wrong if they want to live together. She is still reluctant. And fighting her Anxieties over the matter. To the point that we raised our voice at each other during a video call, because she told me that my life become shitty because of karma, because I lived with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. It was a really big stab in my heart, and I cried but I dismiss what I felt and I still prioritize her because I know she is more vulnerable than I am. Fast forward.......I do not remember if when she did announce that they decided to wed this year. I was surprised and partly disappointed because the first thing that I thought was that I will never see her walking down the aisle in person, and partly I know the reason for the sudden shift. But it was only a short span of time because I understand that she wants to live in peace with the blessing of God. I just express how surprised I am, and I told her I am happy for her at last she will be settling with the man of her dreams.They will have a small wedding this year, and a big wedding next year which in the same month of July 2022.But as the months go on, she always asks me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look dissapointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy?* I always answer her: *People will be surprised of course, because you told them that your wedding is next year and there is a sudden change but that does not mean that they are not happy. do not ever think that.* I know it is her Anxiety talking. I deeply understand, because I also have one I have had depression and Anxiety for how many years. I always put myself in her shoes. Ever our other bestfriend she always asks about it, and she just answers: *It is you and your Fiance who will be getting married, not us, not other people. Only the two of you will create your own Happiness.*I also answer the same thing everytime she asked about it. Until I do not know what to say anymore, I asked my therapist and friends who got married about it. And they say: *Tell her that it is only her that will create her own happiness, not everyone else. But we know Anxiety is a big enemy.*My bestfriend become so anxious as months passed by and at some point became bitchy. Her patience shortened and at one point she is very angry? because the Bishop is not responding through her email, and she even told me if within 2 weeks he does not reply that is it. She will find another one. I told her that she is not the only person who will get married, there is also plenty of couples who wants to wed. And because of pandemic the rules and schedules have changed, she has to understand it. And she was like: *Is this what God wants?*So after a few more weeks, she decided to transfer to another Parish, and to her surprise there are schedules for weddings, the Parish Priest told her that he is available in 2 weeks time they could wed if they want to soon. And she was shocked at how fast it is. And I told her: *There ya go, no worries in finding a Priest and you have a schedule.* And she answered me: *It is too fast and too much.*The priest asked them if they have a venue already? Catering services? Photographer? And others? and they plainly answer: *No, we do not have anything yet.*The official Schedule of her wedding is by September 18 this year. She became more anxious. I understand what they called wedding Jitters. And she still ask me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look disappointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy? Why is it like that?*Last Friday we had that conversation again, and I told her do you want to know the Truth? I can give you answers but you have to be ready. So, I told her that the possibility is that people see it as desperation, lack of security, insecurity, something like that. And I remind her that one time when one of her co-workers commented that is she afraid to lose her Fiance something like that. And then the word **Desperation** struck her. And she asked me is that also what you think of me and \[our other bestfriends name\], is that it? And I plainly answered her: *No.* And there is another question. Were you disappointed when we announced that we are getting married this year? Tell me the Truth. I do not know what I was thinking that time but I told her the Truth that I was a bit disappointed like 50% but it was for a short time. And I am passed by it. It was a very long time ago for me, and all I am focused on is I want her to walk down the aisle. And even volunteered to process her needed papers here in our country.She told me that she was very disappointed in me because she was not expecting that of me. So all this time I was not genuinely happy for her like all of it is fake. I told her it was not, I actually felt guilty that time, that is why I want to make it up to her by helping her with what I could give. She even asked me if our other bestfriend felt the same way and I told her it is not in my position to answer on her behalf. She told me on chat that her friend in UK was so genuinely happy when she asked her if she could be her bridesmaid. And she told me it is better for me to take care of things alone knowing that people are genuinely happy rather than people helping me(which she is pertaining to me) not genuinely happy. I want to justify myself more, but she just answered **WHATEVER.** So I did not push any further, I decided that I just have to let her cooldown, I know she is very stressed out.&amp;#x200B;I contacted our other bestfriend and she called me and we talked a lot via messenger and during that time she is talking to our bestfriend in UK. She is a Teacher here in our country and her patience is kind of running out, but we have to remind ourselves that it is her Anxiety talking right now and we know she will not listen even to us. But my bestfriend kind of admitted to her that what I said about desperation kind of struck her, and somehow she thinks it is true. Perhaps?I decided to mute all my chats in Messenger because I need some time alone. And just played online games, talking to different people to shift my impending Anxiety again of what has happened. I feel like I am terrible bestfriend for that. I am also dealing with a lot of Shit in my life. But for me I have to prioritize her wellbeing. She needs me, and my other bestfriend more than ever. When I talked to my former boss turned male bestfriend I told him what happened, and what I like about his advice is that I am correct at some point but I should have told my bestfriend a **WHITE LIE. Even if she forced me to tell the truth about how I feel.** She seeks positivity and assurance. And I am the only person and my other bestfriend who can give her assurance for that. I learned for that matter more.I am just worried about her, because she is snapping a lot. Not just about the wedding but at her work as well. We told her to breathe. Last time she got extremely mad at her Fiance, because of a simple comment about the flowers. And she was like: *Who will walk down the aisle? Who is the bride? And our wedding is this year! Not next year!* And her Fiance was so afraid whenever she gets mad. That he waited outside her apartment for them to be okay. But my bestfriend just ignored her. But they made up, do not worry. Her Fiance just wants to know, what is their plan? And she admitted that we really do not have one. I told her you two to have to sit down and talk. Listen to what he says. You easily snap.At least they are okay now. And she found a beautiful wedding gown. Which is really really beautiful. But I still do not read her last message because I am thinking I might have to justify myself. Even my other bestfriend is also stressed out and worried that she always burst, she always explodes. She never cools down. I shared our predicament with my married friends and they told me wedding stress is normal, but not that much. Because they balanced things out and talk about it as a couple. I understand my bestfriend wants acceptance. She wants a wedding where everyone is happy around her not just her. She wants to be like that.....Even we told her plenty of times that other people's opinion does not matter. What is important is that they love each other.....but.....she will still ask the same question.....&amp;#x200B;I really do not know what to say. I feel like a bad person telling her how I felt before. I am sorry if this is kind of rollercoaster and long........I am just really worried. It is very hard to talk to someone with a closed-mind right now. Thank you for reading everyone. I feel like a bad person",0
"like these dumb positive ones or ones being like ""yknow maybe an afterlife is plausible"" and stuff and i do not get it.

I did not show up for work yesterday and a day last week now they want to speak to me . I am just fatigued all the time and unmotivated in life in general how I am I suppose to explain that? I am also behind on alot of work but I am just so unmotivated to do it. Its like my body shuts down anytime I want to be productive. Last night I thought about going out for a run I just felt tired and when I woke up it was 1am. I cannot keep going on like this but I do not know how to get out of this cycle Tired of messing up but I am always fatigued,0

I do not even know why I am posting this. I guess I just need someone to listen. Been suffering lately with very bad depression. I really fear I will be alone for the rest of my life. I have no friends. I have never had a boyfriend. The girl I thought was my best friend pretty much turned on me stopped having anything to do with me once she started dating her boyfriend.I just feel like life comes so easily for some people. Making friends and forming relationships seems like a piece of cake for them. My problem is likely that I do not put myself out there. I go to work and keep to myself with my hobbies when I am home. I am extremely insecure.I honestly cannot imagine someone wanting to date me. I think I am ugly and do not know why a guy would be attracted to me. I do not know how to feel worthy enough to even muster the courage to form a dating profile online.Thanks for reading if you read this. I just needed someone to listen. {26F} Fearing I am going to be alone the rest of my life,0
"I have read so many peoples experience on Reddit with depression and it always makes me feel whole again. Like oh that is it! This person was just lacking self esteem! that is my problem too, If I study the six pillars Ill be back to normal. So I do and for a day or two I feel great. But the cycle always seems to start again. I am not even sure if its depression, but I sure feel different these days. I am 18 and when I was sixteen I felt so on top of everything, even looking back at texts I was smart funny, clever and arrogant . I had hobbies and never avoided people. Now I am isolated and anxious around friends and coworkers. Constantly thinking how to say things, what tone to use, is this an appropriate answer to this persons question and incredibly frustrated at my lack of real connection with anybody. Even my cognitive function I feel has gotten weaker, like a bon fire that has simmered down To a candle light. I started blaming the isolation with my family and now I think it was marijuana use. I hate going to my retail job, my mind blanks so often in conversation and worst of all my boss is a nice to me for the wrong reasons. He thinks I have a learning disability. My questions s where do I get help? And does anyone think I needs medication, I am fighting my dad because he does not think I need any meds and that I just have low self esteem? I think hes right about the self esteem , but maybe there is more problems like adhd or depression? Confused and frustrated needed to rant.",0
"My neighbor invited me to their block party. A big problem for me is feeling like everyone hates me. I live in the south and I am middle eastern, so most intersections I have with strangers are negative. I work in retail and wether or not I am working I get antagonized by random white people over the age of 30 everywhere I go. I mind my own business. One tim I had a gun (still in the holster) flashed at me in a CVS because I asked an old man if the wart remover he was holding worked or not. My dads an egomaniac so I cannot talk to him about it he just cares about being right (in his mind he has to win every conversation he has) so its always my fault. Well anyways I decided to get out of my she will a bit and try to be friendly so I baked some baklava, made three different kind of dips, made homemade chips, and went to the party. I worked out beforehand, made sure I looked nice, then went to bring the food to the party. No surprise but everyone was the typical middle class urburban type, and I felt like rector was staruing at me. I waved at a lady who was REALLY staring and she just turned away. Ok, whatever. Say hello to the kids playing in the driveway, they say hi sheepishly but no adult wanted to talk to me. I set the dip down tried to start a convo with some of the dads standing around, nothing but the cold shoulder. So now I am just home with some leftover baklava and dip. Is it my fault for only giving them like 15 minutes? I really tried guys I am an introvert but I tried so hard and it was so awkward. I felt like an alien everyone was looking at me studying me and no one wanted to talk to me. I might be looking too much into it but one guy I think actually walked all the way around the little tent table thing to avoid me, I only say that because it would have been wayyyyy quicker to walk past me. He half-stepped in trees and bushes. Idk. I know this is pathetic but I cannot help but feel so alone. I know I need to move north but its hard because were so poor and I do not have any family or friends besides my dad. Thanks for reading, no one cares I am sorry I am just at the end of my rope here. I do not have an infinite amount of patience, how many times do I have to put myself out there only to get rejected. Actually went my neighbors block party, spent all night making dip and baklava, now I am eating it alone.",1

"TLDR When I am not good at something it bothers me until I am depressed and hating myselfEvery time I play a game of chess or I figure out something I am not good at it bothers me like hell I cannot get over the things I am not good at even if I do not enjoy it. I hit myself in the head and stress ALOT about things that I do not even enjoy.it is weird it is like I do not specifically enjoy the thing I am doing like chess,hair, etc and I still stress about it.I do not KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN. I do not remember the last time I specifically had fun because I am too serious and competetive. This is why I deleted social media. Whenever someone tells me (maybe this thing is not for you) I see it as a insult that me as a person is not smart or good enough for this specific activity and it pisses me off. I want to be good at everything and it bothers me when I am not. I lose or fail at something like a video game and it runs my day and I let it. it is so hard to not let the little things bother me.Is this perfectionism? Or am I just trying too hard at everything? How do I get rid of this?",0
"I cannot believe my mind/brain has become as sick as it now is. I have been fighting and trying and now I am afraid that I am not going to make it. I am posting this here because it is not my last ditch effort. I am tired of wearing my friends down. As soon as I take what feels like a victorious 5 steps forward, I take 10 back. I have all the insight in the world as to what is going on with my brain, what thoughts I should ignore, blah blah blah (I do not say that to minimize their importance), but it really is to the point that I do not care if I die in my sleep. It feels like there is something inherently wrong with my entire profile as a person and I am only 32 and feel like I have lived for 80 years. I think my reserves are tapped and even when I see a light at the end of the tunnel, it gets eclipsed. I cannot even be scared for myself anymore. I do not even want to ask for help anymore. I would not wish this on anyone. Been asking for help...and I am losing [if not lost] hope",0
"No matter what I do or how hard I try, my family just never bothers with me. Its been like this for the past year and it is really fucking getting to me.I ask my dad to teach me how to ride a bike and all I got was ""we will do it tomorrow"" for the past week.People tell me to ""talk more"" yet when I do, no one listens.It took me 2 months to get a credit card because everyone that I asked to help me just kept saying ""we will do it tomorrow"" or ""I will help you later"" in the end I had to do it myself.The list goes on. I ask people online and they just say ""tell them how you feel"" yet when I do I just get sarcastic comments because they think that I am joking, apparently storming off and having a mental breakdown is me being spoilt. I even tried running away for fucks sake and I got brought home and everyone forgot about it and carried on the same shit in a day. A fucking day.My dad told me ""get off of your fat ass and go make some friends"" because I did not feed a dog that I thought had already been fed.Life is so shit. I am sick of people saying the same shit then going around telling people that they saved me. Fuck people man. My family never pulls through for me and they do not care about me.",0

I was so scared at the idea of killing myself for a long time. My wife told me she would be so sad and hurt. I believe her but I also believe I have tried very hard to live in my mind and I cannot anymore. Everyone is so hyped about you not killing yourself because life is so sacred and people love you! Right? Then when you leave the psych ward or you finish the nineteenth million trauma therapy session and everyone feels so good you talked about your little feelings and your on the mend. Why cannot we just admit that this is the more humane option for some? I left a note for my wife in her email. I hope she knows and believes me when I say there is literally nothing she could have done. No one could.The earliest train will inconvenience the least amount of people. God speed. I do not feel bad that I cannot keep going,1
"For so long I thought I was just born with depression and anxiety. That something in my brain I was born with was the reason I felt disconnected and had panic attacks and struggled to make it through the day. And it is just now that I am realizing I was physically, emotionally and psychologically abused by my dad all throughout my childhood. And my mom was too weak to stop him.That shit is the starting point of so many of the fucked up things in my head and it took me 25 years to realize that what was happening even counted as abuse. And it sucks because now I am just stuck like this. The anxiety is not going away, the awkwardness is not going away. The loneliness is not going away. Instead of just being depressed, now I am confused, and angry, and just as depressed as before. Fuck My parents fucked me up",0

"Hi, this is kind of new to me but I figured I would look for advice from anyone in a similar situation. I have been with my partner now for a long time and we have a strong and loving relationship. During this time, I have become quite close with his family, especially my mother-in-law. Recently, my brother-in-law has started to date a new girl and we get along very well! However, I have found myself in a bit of an episode and unfortunately, I am really struggling with how everyone else interacts with her. For example, I feel as though my mother-in-law has started to pick favorites, based on the jokes she has made. However, the rational side of my brain is telling me that that is not the case. Any suggestions on how I get over this or how to feel more secure in my relationships? Not the favorite",0
"I am 25 yrs old (F) and I suffer from depression and anxiety. It just seems like life just has it out for me and I am falling deeper and deeper into this depressive state. I feel like I am being swallowed up whole and there just is not anything that I can do about it. It does not help either that I bottle up all my emotions and then turn around and cry myself to sleep every night bc of how horrible I feel about myself. Like somehow everything and anything bad that has happened to me is somehow my fault and that I deserve it. I truly feel that I do not deserve to be happy or that I am worthy enough to be loved in any kind of way.None of my best friends really understand the pain I have been feeling nor have any of them cared to connect the dots that I disconnected myself from all of my social media platforms. I do not blame tho, I get that everyone else is just living their lives but it would be nice for someone to notice that I am not myself anymore and have not been for a long time. Although I feel so alone, I do have one person in my life that I can always turn to and that would be my dad. Yet, I am ashamed to admit to him how low I feel all the time and that what I am feeling is far beyond my own personal control at this point. I also do not want him to know bc somehow I am afraid he will resent me for not being more strong minded like himself. Falling deeper",0

At first the withdrawals were AWFUL but i soldiered on but its been a month and a half now and I am starting to have hallucinations. Mainly at night. Dark corners/hallways and windows ect. When it happens I just tell myself its not real. Has anybody else experienced this? It seems so late to be experiencing the worst parts of the withdrawals. Tempted to get back on it. Not sure if its a side affect of getting off it or I am just going crazy now that the medication is out my system *nervous laughter* I have an appointment with my doctor for Monday. Just thought a second opinion will not hurt. Preferably someone that is experienced the same thing. Hallucinations from getting off 30mg mirtazipine,0
"So after awhile I have decided to go ahead and try counselling with my school counsellor this friday.This past year has been extremely exhausting mentally. With the amount of stress I am facing, my bottled up emotions and (i do not want to self-diagnose) childhood trauma are resurfacing. During the past few months, my thoughts and emotions have become harder to control and I finally decided to seek help for the first time. I initially thought that I would go to therapy after i graduate from school but i realised that I do not think Ill last that long to make it that far. I was afraid that if I do not seek help soon, I do not think i could hang on any longer. So here is the first step I am going to take even though I was incredibly hesitant at first. Hopefully it goes well. Going to counselling for the first time",0

"Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I am leaving. I have no closure and still do not even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I had not done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die. I do not expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one. Cry for help",0
"(Tl;DR: I had two back to back suicide attempts and I feel like I died after the second one but nothing is there to prove it. I feel guilty about the amount that was spent on me in the hospital, and I am still immensely suicidal.) I had two attempts basically back to back, the first on June 1st of 2021 and then one on June 25th of the same year. Both of overdose on benadryl and prescribed Prozac. My first was alone on my favorite forest, I did it at 3 pm after I got off work and drove home at 11 at night. I was grounded for staying out past curfew and the friend B I had been 'messaging' during it (it was all gibberish on my part) had forgotten his phone in someone is car halfway through it. he is all I have. I was terrified the first time I tried to kill myself because of hallucinations, so the next attempt I did with him next to me. I got mad he stopped me, and a fight broke out. We drove to a nearby park and because he knew I would taken much more before and he knew I was afraid of the cops he just let me sleep it off in the bed of my truck while he was with me. He left me three hours in because a cop told us to leave (how the cop did not notice I was out of my mind is beyond me) so he drove home and thought I would have left the park but I just got back in and I drove back home at 4 in the morning. Went to bed, and woke up and I was still hallucinating so my mom took me to the hospital and then I was put in the phych ward for 8 days and put on new meds. I feel like I died this time. Everything feels so wrong. it is like everything is repeating itself. I do not know of its the new meds I was put on (which are not helping and I still want to die) or I did actually die or if I am just out of synch because everyone is tiptoeing around me because I am 'sensitive' all of a sudden. I just get moments of deja vu when I am working and it is just 'holy shit I died the last time I tried did not i' just every single time I get it it is the same feeling of 'I am still stuck even when I died. I am going to be stuck like this forever if I did actually die' each time. I just want to die. I have nothing besides the lack of romance that is pushing me and that is not even a big bother to me. I just want to stop hurting people I love and give them the freedom of not having to deal with me any more. My parents pretend they care because they have to and now I am just a waste of money again. A shitty cremation would have been cheaper and better than the amount they spent on me to go to the hospital and it did not even help me. I just want to die so bad. I feel like I died after my second attempt but I know I did not and I am still suicidal despite it.",1

"To whomever it may or may not concern,I am sorry I am not very much myself at all. This is not me. For which I mean to say, I have seen better days, felt more like me...had a heartbeat with more lightness in it. If you are looking for someone to blame for it, it seems apparent to blame me. After all, I have no one to pin this on, except myself. And it has taken me years to accept that it might just be my fault anyway...not a factor of different traumas, and past abuse...not a lack of understanding the cruelty of the world around me and discovering dissapointment like I discovered my own talents......me....this is all my fault...for being the way I am...for making you all worry and look at me with bewilderment and disinterest...I do not blame you...I have blamed myself for years for it...I think I still do. But, just know that for each and every punishment I receive, self inflicted, my faults are being corrected. that is why I am in this cage you see. that is why I cannot come out...I have tossed out the key, so I would not think to ask for it. And now, I just wait here...in the darkness. I wait for the end. But it will not come. Of course not...I am in a cage. Nothing can get in here to kill me...except for myself. Oh do not worry my friends. I will not do anything too bad. Certainly will not leave without telling you all first...though it is tempting to. After all...did you really remember me when I was gone for all those years?...perhaps, you thought of me, every so often. Maybe there was something in your day, a voice, a joke, a toy, a song, a movie, that reminded you of me. That put a smile on your face, thinking of the good times we shared together...a nice afternoon in the summer, sharing ice cream....a pizza party with a game of hide and go seek.....a sleepover with pajamas and board games....maybe video games and anime....maybe a friendly dinner and a walk through the town....I miss those times too. But they are all over. Dead and still, only living in our minds. I want to join those memories, but I cannot you say, not when I can make new menories...not while I can have better times.But to be honest...from this cage of mine, I do not see how I can. So I sit and lie down and roll around...clutching the memories I have. I am not brave enough to ask you all for more. I am not brave enough to welcome new ones. I have...been stripped of my courage. I am naked. Cold and silent. Unable to cry for help...like a fish out of water. I am only able to struggle in my suffocation...I am drying out...I gaze up and away...I lay still. I want to give up. I need someone to return me to myself again. I do not ask you to do this for me. I am a slippery fish. I am an unwilling victim of self-awareness. I will resist and bite and run. I will run. I will hide....I am afflicted by something that prevents me from getting rid of it, little by little...and it is powerful. It grips me with a vice, and uses my stripped courage as a trophy to intimidate me. it is a monster. And it is myself. I am it is underling. I serve it, and obey it is command....and the orders are killing me.Soon I will not be so alone my friends. I might not be anything. Or I might have company. I might actually be understood. I am sorry I am so presumptuous in assuming that you do not understand me, but...that is simply what this monster tells me. Each and every one of you I know, has problems. Has struggles. Has traumas. I do not understand them...so why would you understand mine? Not while I see your shining lives and sunny faces convey a message of health to me, that I am distant from. I lament my ignorance and my innocence, though I try to hold onto what is left of it is destroyed remains. I have cried, and grieved over the places I used to go for comfort, no longer welcome to me. I have nothing....I have...no one...because of this cage. Please, you need not claim your loyal hold on our friendship and make the effort to be there. I would think the world of it...and I would also panic immensely about it. My trust, having been shaken so much, I worry that I will not have much trust left if I give it away so freely. It must hurt to hear from me that I cannot put my trust in you....I am sorry....I do not mean to hurt you. I only mean to push you away, and to reject your kind words and thoughts and gestures...so I can stay in this dark. So you cannot take me away from the monster trying to kill me. I just want to make you leave me alone, so I can help this cursed monster spread into you. I need to deterr you from helping me, even though your help is something that will save my life. I need to keep you from caring about me because if I do not...I am going to feel like a total, parasitic burden. I am going to feel it all at once...I am going to break down, into the soft-fleshed, vulnerable, delicate little creature I am. There will be nothing to keep you from hurting me the most, and I will be in such as state the likes of which has not been seen. I will need comfort, and if I go without it, I will be hurt just as much as if you would step on me. I will be helpless. I will be weeping rivers. All the anger, and loneliness and years of loathing and self-pity will come in a wave so large I will catch a cold from the tears I leave behind. I am in pain to tell you this...but I know you do not need this in your life. You do not need to help me. You do not need to care. You do not need to feel so sorry. I know you have better things to do. You have people that care for you more than I do. You have lives to live. You have things to look forward to. You must. Because I do too. I just cannot see them from where I am.Dear friends...I hope maybe I can see you again someday. I hope I can make you proud someday. I hope you understand...I wish I could be myself with you again...

i have thought about suicide many times and many times I have also just forgotten about it but with so many problems lately in my life I cannot seem to feel okay about anything anymore. My bf rather sleep in the hot car outside than talk things out with me. Everything is falling apart feeling very down about my relationship/life,1

Hello everyone. I take 10 mg lexapro and 50 mg sulpiride everyday. Anyone here got the same vaccine while on sulpiride? I will get my second dose tomorrow and I am worried. I was not on medication on my first dose. Thanks. Sulpiride/lexapro and pfizer vaccine,0
"Everytime a conversation starts, I keep silence, hide myself and suddenly disappear from the chat. I do not want to talk with more than one person a time, I cannot do it anymore. Actually, I think this is becoming a fear to me, like, fear of groups. When I am walking on the street, and I see a group of people talking with each other, I want to dig a hole on the ground and hide myself until they pass. that is what I feel I am feeling like I lost my capacity to talk in groups.",0

"I am in a dark place, lots of thoughts of suicide and/or just walking till I die. I am losing my grip on reality. I do not know who I am. I think I cannot die. When nothing matters does it even exist. Do we even exist. I have been diagnosed ocd and depression but that was a decade ago. I have wanted to die my whole life. Recent trauma is causing me extra pain and its why I am losing my grip on reality. Can anyone relate to this? Especially the losing touch with reality. Am I supposed to know I am this out of it? Am I just full of shit? Losing touch with reality",0
"The past month or 2 I have forced myself to go out, to not listen to sad music, not stay in bed. Literally every day I have gone out with friends socializing meeting new people etc. But I cannot enjoy any of it, at all, there is not joy or pleasure in any of it but recently after it got too tiring I sat in bed and just let it take over and felt sorry for myself and thought about all the things making me depressed etc and then I woke up from a nap I had and went to a social event and I actually enjoyed myself. I could experience pleasure and joy with people and fully engage and focus on people.it is like focusing it all in one time and letting it have its reign instead of fighting it for a period of time allows me to feel things in the other aspects of my life. Has anyone else found a similar thing? Succumbing to my depression allows me to enjoy the other aspects of my life.",0
"I never understand why people go out of their way to put me up on a pedestal. Both people I know and strangers online offer positive reinforcement and encourage me to be healthy, and sometimes even go on to defend my actions. I cannot forgive myself and I do not deserve this kind of attention. I hate that I am ugly, I hate that I say stupid shit, I hate that I was the abuser, and I hate that nobody sees me as a worthless, unintentionally bigoted manipulator who does not deserve love in the slightest.

"What am I supposed to be fearing regards to death? The religion I was raised in says it will be a deep sleep. Science tell me it will not be anything. But for some reason I still cannot do it. Let me not say for some reason the truth is I know why. I am a pussy. Honestly, I cannot take my life in to my own hands because I am a pussy. I do not want to try to live my life out of this religion because I am a pussy. I cannot tell anybody how I feel about the religion because I am a pussy. Instead of just shutting up and moving on I am here because I am a pussy. I know I am weak yet i still cannot penetrate my skin with my knife. Why? Because I am weak, I cannot do it because I am weak. All I have to do is endure pain for a couple of minutes and I will not feel anything anymore, yet I still cannot do it. I lost my god, I lost the one person that always had my back. I lost jehovah. I have been with out him for 6 months, trying to pretend I am not sad. Telling my self that I am ok. I know I am not but whining about it on a forum is not going to help, yet here I am. I do not even have fucking friends, all I have is people on a server. They do not even care for me, they care for a username. I wish there was just a button to press to die. I with there was a bus or train to stand in front of. I wish I had a gun to go out in a painless way. But no, I do not have any of that stuff. I have a box cutter and a pocket knife. I keep pressing it against my skin but I am not man enough to break. I am a pussy. I am not strong",1
I am 17 yr old guy and I am just 5'8.5 (almost 5'9). I hate my height. Also my face is ugly. I hate everthing about myself. Why cannot i be taller and decent looking like my friends.

"Hi all, first time here hope you guys are doing well. To start, I can tell you that being a 5 foot tall male living here in America is worse than death. Everyone treats me like absolute shit, from strangers, friends, family, and of course women. it is already challenging making friends, dating life is on a whole other level of difficulty. I have had countless instances from strangers to even family giving me dirty looks, treating me unfairly solely for my height. I have followed the advice of what short males should do, such as working on yourself by improving looks, earning money, confidence, personality, etc. I have done all that, I am an attractive guy, I have money, and I am muscular for my size. I workout and I am 160lbs at 18% bodyweight, which is huge for my size. Despite all these positives that everyone says you should focus on, it has not changed a thing as far as dating life. There has been two instances in which I have been told the exact quote ""I would date you if you were taller"" by my crushes, once in high school and the other recently in college, and these events destroyed me. I do not get any attention from women even though I have all these attributes. I cannot really blame them because they can probably find someone else who has exactly all the same qualities as me, only that they are taller so why the fuck would they go for me? I am nothing special. I am currently 20, studying a passion that I love at a good university, and I have a family that cares for me. Those are the only reasons I have not offed myself yet. My parents have used so much of their time and money putting into my education and life, and I know if I kill myself my entire family's life will be ruined forever. And my depression/suicidal thoughts are completely hidden from them because I am too embarrassed to tell them or anyone else for the matter. it is just not an option, I am sorry. Reflecting on my current life, I literally have no friends. Barely had any success dating wise. These past years have made me turn into a person that I never thought I would become. I began hating everyone I see, especially if they were taller because I keep questioning why life fucked me over for my height while everyone else gets to enjoy theirs normally. And I am sorry if you think this is not a reason for suicide, but to me it is been the biggest problem of my life that I just cannot handle any longer. I really do not know how much longer I can tolerate this. I fear that I will never get to live a normal life as everyone else from enjoying time with friends to being loved romantically with a partner, so why would I waste anytime and just end it all now? Purpose of living as a 5 foot tall male?",1
"When it really hits me, it is like a pile of bricks coming at me and I am emotionally weighed. I feel so ill but I cannot really do anything about it. I am sick but not physically sick, I am emotionally sick. I feel like I cannot really even tell someone how I feel as I have never really told anyone. I just feel so horrible I do not even have words to explain....I am a mess I absolutely hate being depressed",0
"Heard my grandparents talk behind my back, ""Why does not she ever go out, even x goes out and does this and that""I only heard bits of their conversation but I also heard the word ""crazy"" in my native languageTo think that I asked for help and my mom and grandma just brushed it off. I have been sick for what feels like a decade now and I am so sick of being sick, I just want to die.I got my diagnosis when my friends snuck me into therapy. The psychiatrist had to stop meeting me because he would lose his license if he did. A year or two later, I confessed to my grandma but she got mad because I told my friends. I do not know what I expected. she is always cared about her reputation the most. Always bragged about me attending a nice school and getting nice grades. does not want a word of me being depressed going out and refuses to address it. My performance in school has started deteriorating, I am not sleeping and eating well. I asked for a break from school but I am not getting it. I am going to get dragged to school tomorrow for my college enrollment. have not settled my clearance and will most likely be waitlisted. A part of me did it intentionally out of spite and also, is there even a point anymore? I do not know if I can hold out for longer. I am at a point where I might kill myself any time. Thinking is exhausting and I really wish that I would just do it already.Whenever I got sick and had to be absent from school for a day or two, my grandma does not even ask me why or if I am alright. she is more concerned about the fact that I am absent from school. I could go on about how terrible of a person she is but you already get it.My family always says how grateful I should be because they fed me and gave me shelter. I fucking hate it so much. Thanks, I was not aware that having children is so similar to having pets. (Although I would do so much more than food and shelter if I had a pet.)Everything hurts. I just woke up from a whole day's sleep and I just want to sleep again in the hopes that I will never wake up. The only thing I do whenever I am awake is cry anyway. My eyes hurt so much at this point.I am 18 already so I could go and meet a psychiatrist without needing my family's consent now. But I am so tired and I cannot function anymore.I hope my unhealthy lifestyle kills me soon. Even suicide sounds so tiring. I am going back to sleep. Asked for help but did not get it.",1

"Has anybody ever found therapy cured their depression entirely? Did anyone ever go into complete remission after therapy? Do you know anyone who has? I do not feel like it ever leaves you entirely.

"I have no friends, no family, no social interaction since the pandemic. For the past few months I have been dreaming of travelling to Europe and see places I always wanted to see however it starts to look impossible this summer. I have worked hard to earn money for this trip. Soon I have to work term and will not have time do anything. If I do not start working I will probably go into a lot financial trouble. If I do I will probably underperform due to severe depression due to isolation and cannot keep the job. I had suicidal thoughts my whole life and have a few failed attempts. I have been trying to keep my morale high and improving myself greatly past few years however the suicidal thoughts are back since the pandemic are I cannot stand living anymore. Social isolation is literally hell and I really wanted to make that trip to make up for my wasted youth. I really need some advice. I do not want to start working I just want to live a little I think I earned it with all the hardwork I put into my future and my finances. If I start in this mental state I will most likely get fired because I really need a break from what I have been through all my life (abuse from family and not being accepted by others all my life, just as I started to fix what is wrong with me and started making friends for the first time the quarantines started). If I do not financial trouble. Either way I really do not have any hopes for the future anymore suicide is starting to sound rational again. Almost 1.5 years of isolation.",1

"Last year was the low point of my life. My wife left me, I had gained a massive amount of weight, my sleep schedule was completely out of whack, I was extremely depressed, constantly felt weak, never wanted to leave the house, etc. Also worth noting I have been balding since highschool and my sex drive was at an all time low.Needless to say, I saw another post on reddit someone with low T levels describing their symptoms and it was like reading an autobiography. I went to my doctor and sure enough, my testosterones was at ground levels. The doctor got me set up on testosterones therapy and the results have been life changing.Since then I have effortlessly lost weight, I am in a waaaaaaaaay better mental state, my sex drive is through the roof, I am hitting the gym (something I thought I would never say) and I am even dating again.Seriously, if any of these symptoms describe you go see your doctor. it is way more common than people realize and nothing to be ashamed of. Getting my testosterone levels checked saved my life. [27M]",0
"So I know suicidal feelings are probably the result of trauma and modern life, capitalism sucks, but most definitely a parent making you feel like you do not deserve your existence and it is definitely my case, but being aware of it does not solve anything. I feel unable to heal. I feel like I cannot move on. I feel like I am tired. I cannot go on. I am too young to be living on my own. I want my dad to tell me he loves me but I pushed him away. I want to play with his Xbox. I want to hang out with him. I want him to help me pay a doctor and help me figure out what is going on inside my mind because my mom abused me so bad. I want to go running with him. But I cannot because I ruined our relationship and I cannot fix it, and I am afraid to fix it. I want my ex to hold me but I pushed him away too. I want to never have hurt important friends in my life, but it is too late. I want to become better at singing but I cannot bring myself to be disciplined enough to practice. I want to workout but I do not feel like it. I want to be good at my job but I am always fucking up when my boss is present and she thinks I am mediocre. I want to be okay but I do not feel ready to be okay. I am not used to the absence of caos. I feel like trying to get better is a trap. I feel like my mother's abuse started from the moment she decided to conceive me and killing myself would be actually rebelling against her because maybe the fact that I am still here, suffering, without justice for what she did to me, is exactly what she wants, but I cannot stop feeling so much pain in my soul. I am too tired. I cannot go on. I cannot do this. I want out. I cannot be fixed",1

"I am so tired.I know in my heart I can fight this. I have done this a million times before. But for what? A few brisk moments where I can lie to myself and pretend it is all okay. But it is not. I am not okay.I do not want to fight anymore. It never changes anyway. Nothing gets better. I do not think it ever will. Whenever I try to fix things they only end up in a worse state than when I began. One of the things I regret is when I do nothing. I vowed to protect them. The little angels who brought me a sliver of hope when I was at my lowest. The ones who gave me a reason to continue on in this cruel world of pain and torment. But I lied. As it turns out, my promises are nothing but empty words and lies. I tried so hard at first, but no matter what I did it was never enough. I am just too scared she is going to hurt me and they have to pay the price. It pains me to know that they are going to grow up the same way as I did just because I am too much of a coward to do anything.Yet another thing that has gone wrong, because of me. I just hope I can help ease the pain as much as possible so they do not end up as much of a pitiful excuse for a human being as me.Its not getting better. Its never going to is it? I am going to be 15 soon. That is If I stay alive for long enough to see that day. I used to tell myself that they needed me. It would be selfish to leave them again. I am still so guilty about the first time I left them. I wonder how many times they cried for me. And all because I was too selfish to stay. But they coped last time. They do not need me. One thing I do not get is why everyone still just blames him. do not they see?!? My other siblings do not remember. Nobody remembers. Nobody knows. I am left to carry the burden of the past all on my own. it is not like I could forget after all. I remember every word, every bruise every tear. I remember everything. I remember the pain and the sorrow and the hope for the future. I remember it all. that is the only thing that is really changed I guess.There is no hope.They make out she was the victim. He stabbed her in the heart and left her for dead while she was the heroine who save the day and soldiered on for her children. What a load of bullshit. I know the truth. I was there and I watched it. The images are ingrained in my memory, the truth like a bullet lodged in my skull. They were both as bad as eachother, a fiendish pair. She is not innocent. I remember when she held me down and made him record me as I screamed and cried and begged her to stop ""restraining me"" as they put it. All I did was talk back. All I did was get upset. All I did. I remember when she threatened to post the footage of me screaming and crying on social media if I did not do as she said. Blackmail was one of their favorite forms of punishment. I REMEMBER IT ALL. I remember when I was three and he held me against the wall by neck shouting in my face, the stench of alcohol on his breath overwhelming. I remember when I told her I was going to kill myself and she called me a coward and told me to wait until the morning because she was too tired and there was nothing she could do, yet when her perfect princess said she was feeling depressed she took her up the hospital. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOTH SAT THERE AND IGNORED EVERYTHING MY SISTER DONE. EVERY WORD SHE SAID EVERY BRUISE SHE GAVE ME. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FIVE AND I CAME DOWNSTAIRS IN TEARS BECAUSE BOTH OF MY SIBLINGS WERE BULLYING ME AND SHE JUST TOLD ME TO BE HER BIG BRAVE GIRL INSTEAD OF ADRESSING THE ISSUES. I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER. AND OH HOW I WISH I COULD FORGET. ALL I WANTED WAS FOR THEM TO LOVE ME. WHAT DID I DO WRONG?!? WHAT DID I DO!?!I am sorry about that. It just hurts to know that after all of that they get off scot free and I am left in the dust scrambling around trying to find the pieces of myself that they tore up and scattered in the wind. It hurts when they talk about how brave my sister is and how she had it so much worse than us because she was the oldest. How it is all my dad's fault. My sister has a boyfriend who loves her and a generous following on social media. She has money. She could not be happier. My mother met her dream guy. they are about to get married. Where does that leave me? I think you can guess. If I was in the same place they were I would not be going to reddit to write all of this. I would not need to. they have done so much more and caused so much damage and it hurts to know that all I ever did was try to be good. All I ever wanted was to be nice. I did everything they told me to do. I tried so hard. So why am I stuck here and they get their perfect lives? What did I do wrong?If you read this, please help me. Tell me where I went wrong so I can fix it. Please. All I ever wanted, was to be happy. The weight of the past",0

"Am 26, and still have not finished college. I got into the recent stock market craze and lost $100,000 in liquid assets last March (started with 14k life savings cash that I saved up in January that ballooned over a couple of months), since then I mentally spiraled downwards and my grades suffered, ended up getting academically suspended from college. It felt like I finally had a chance beyond a life of suffering, wage slaving, being stuck in a low socio economic swamp. I cannot even afford going to college anymore. Since March, got help, that is, therapy and a psychiatrist which neither I feel so far has really helped in any significant fashion. I actually have, since sessions and being prescribed medication, sunk even worse into a black pit of despair. I do not think people understand even the basic surface level of mental health solutions in modern day. Just seeing a therapist and taking meds will not fix everyone. The state of how, at least in America, mental health treatment is addressed is frankly a joke. It was easier for me to get prescribed antidepressants than ordering a pizza. I flat out told my therapist that I thought my psychiatrist is a fucking clown. 15 minute session where you briefly describe your symptoms, almost like a WebMD referral robot, but it is an actual licensed professional and they just throw pills at you at the end of the expensive session; voila, come back for an in progress consultation if you need to more dosage or to hop to a different med that probably will have another slew of side effects. Talk to anyone that is actively, or have been in therapy and ask them how many therapists they been to before they found ""the right one"". Why is there such a core difference with these professionals? Because it is honestly a goddamn circus internally, and I assume there is no standardized method of licensed schooling apparently. ""Go exercise. Take a hot shower. Have a routine."" I do all of those things, but I am just a high functioning depressed person that can clean, do chores without my living conditions being something from r/neckbeardnests. What am I doing now? Soon moving back home now to my backwards, rural country hometown, with no hope for the near or long term future - I just been trying to distract myself reading books or playing video games, listening to vinyl records .Honestly and truly, I think I am going to end it all early August. There is not a single thing, feeling, goal in this universe that I desire anymore. Last night, had a nightmare that brought up past mistakes - even in my dreams I feel guilty and suffer. When I wake up, I just feel like a walking zombie and the anhedonia saps every morsel from anything that I try to do. Resignation from Life",1

"Just as a gentle reminder when it comes to mental health: At the top of their games and at the height of their powers, Barry Sanders retired, Rob Gronkowski took a break, Michael Jordan took two breaks, Calvin Johnson retired, Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open, Mike Krzyzewski took a break/leave midway through the 1995 season and did not come back until practice the next year.

"I have had the same thoughts of guilt, anger, and sadness for a week the third time. it is all I can think about is the same imagery over and over again, my emotions and reaction to it. One morning when I was having breakfast with my mom as I turned 15 in May. I just cried seeing that imagery and my mom asked me what made me sad and what is upsetting me. I was scared to tell her the truth because I was scared that she would view me a different person because of my addiction to porn and would cast me out even though that night she would support me and told me to tell her anything that bothers me but I am scared to talk to her because of the subject matter.

Being told to keep going is being told to swim while wearing concrete shoes life is so ducking painful and there is only one way to stop it.

Why am I supposed to want to live what the fuck do I have to live for? I have been so fucking lonely especially since spring its just gotten 1000 times worse. Lifes been nothing but breakdown after breakdown and being punished for trying to escape.

I am so weak in both body and mind and despite having bigger things to worry about, all I want is to be loved. To be held with a warm embrace as my tears gently fall from my face. it is not going to happen though. Nobody is going to want me for myself when there are better choices than I.I am trying to make friends online, but it is very hard as people have there own groups and stop talking to me after awhile. I am scared to speak to anyone in person out of fear that someone will see me as a creep. it is how I view myself. I have been addicted to porn for so long, it is as if people can see the disgusting things I have done and watched just by looking at me. I know they cannot, but that fear creeps up from behind and silences me. I have not been masturbating as of late, but its only a matter of time before I give in to my urges, falling deeper in the rabbit hole I made. This cycle constantly stops me from being able to approach anyone at times out of fear of judgement.Maybe this is coming off as whining, but I do not know where I could express my struggles and frustrations. I do not feel comfortable disclosing this to my family. I do go to therapy, but it feels as if I am learning nothing and the meds I am on are not working. I say everything I can in hopes that something that I have said will be a start to a healthy life, but nothing has shown itself as of now. I want to be strong so I can put this all behind me and finally start living the life I want.

"I am the only sibling who struggles a lot with mental health, from what I know of. My sister has had her moments, but she is never been constantly struggling, and my brother is always positive. But, I am the one who is depressed. I am the one who is anxious. I am the one who cannot make friends because it pains me to talk to people. I am the one who barely does anything but sit in my room and write and read. My parents have done a lot for me, they always try to help with my mental health, even if they do not understand it, but I wonder sometimes if they are embarrassed of me. I wonder if my sister or my brother is embarrassed of me. I wonder if they all get tried of me asking about small, stupid things because I am terrified about them. I wonder if they get tried of me looking so sad all the time or barely hanging out with anybody. I wonder if when someone asks about me, my parents do not talk about me because who would want to talk about a depressed kid? Anytime I try to speak up and ask for some comfort on something, I feel like my parents are just tired of me. Over the past year, I have been getting better at being able to speak up when worried, but it seems as if they are irritated and upset with me for asking for comfort so much over such stupid things. In my head, they are big and suffering and keep me up at night, but my parents always tell me that I cannot let those kind of things control me. I am trying. I am really trying. But sometimes I just need someone to tell me it is going to be okay, you know? I am worried they all think of me as an embarrassment. I am worried they are getting tired of my questions and my worries. I am just worried that being like this makes me embarrassing. Am I something to be ashamed of? Should I be ashamed? Should I have the strength to work it out on my own? Am I an embarrassment?",0

Maybe a handful of times she was interested in talking with me and it was usually always picking up on bad things I believe because she thinks I am ugly. Of course you do not do that with someone you find attractive. I have felt really suicidal over this and its got to the point know where she knows and we do not talk anymore and act cold around each other.

People think that you are lazy and all that but who cares we just sit at home play games watch movies and surf the internet, and are not willing to study or go out or get to work. If this feels similar and then do not stop reading I was not aware of the fact a few years back too I am 23 years old from India and this country is not japan so they mostly do not know about it because They do not watch a lot of anime and they do not know about this term 'NEET' so her's my story like back in 2017 I guess I dropped out of college and my life set back 360 degree I was a fun party-loving college fresher then how I became a Shut-in NEET ? that I also do not have an answer. Now I have Agoraphobia and some symptoms of schizophrenia to I was not diagnosed but I can tell my situation very well I tried jobs and work from home could not stay for much longer, how long I will say less than a month I do not know what is going to happen in my future that is uncertain and it is been four fucking long years and thanks to Covid people did not ask about me a lot for the past 2 years it is been 5 years since I became a NEET every day is like a Groundhog Day- Eat, Sleep,Repeat I do not how much longer I will live. I have grown tired and cannot get out of this. I lost touch with my social life, friends, everything I was a person that would be used to get back home late enjoy adventuring I miss those days but seems impossible Life of a Shut-in NEET in India",0
Does a guys mental health even netter?Like for a certain kind of guy who is always giving his time away and helping everyone but himself. A guy who works his ass off to receive so fucking little in return. A guy that the only time he gets to himself is in the bathroom. A guy that never rests and fucks himself over so others do not have to. Does it even matter?,0
"I am new to Reddit. My eldest son was always sending me links to stuff on here that he would found interesting and Id end up in a Reddit rabbit hole every now and again but I have never posted anything. So 3 months since, I found my eldest son. He had taken his own life. He was 22. Since then my world has pretty much fallen apart as you would expect. I have 2 younger children and a partner (we were actually separated at the time my son took his own life but I have not been in a great place and hes stuck around). I always thought I was a good parent. My kids are smart, funny, well mannered, all round balanced kids (or so I thought). I have never been suicidal until after this. I am overcome by guilt for not being able to save my son. I attempted suicide after his funeral. I feel so bad for my younger children but this feels much bigger than the love I have for them. When my son was small, I had a partner who lived with us, he was a great guy and loved the kids but there was no spark for me. I was young myself and I asked my partner to leave. A few months before he died, my son mentioned to me that he always blamed himself for my partner leaving because he said,he had asked if he could call him dad and Id said he could. I told him I did not remember this but of course it was never his fault and I was sorry I did not make that clearer to him at the time (he would have been 6). So over the years its mainly been me and the kids and I dated guys but it never amounted to anything. The kids never wanted for anything, I went to uni and got a good job and we always had holidays to nice places etc. I was proud of my kids, how Id managed to bring up such amazing kids on my own and I never really minded being on my own. So now, after this, I feel completely responsible. I did not realise my son was feeling this way. We worked different hours so usually communicated by text but this was every day. We had a lot in common and we got on well and had always had a good relationship. Since he died, I have found out that he told an ex girlfriend he had suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts all through his teens, I never knew this. I feel like I have completely failed my son and also his younger siblings. I feel like now, if Id have stayed with my ex partner all those years ago, the kids would have had a father figure and someone around who loved and cared for them I am addition to me. I am almost certain he would still be alive. I feel like my immature decisions when I was younger were selfish. It was not intentional but I feel that the fall out has been massive and now there is nothing I can do to fix this. I think about ending my life most days because I simply cannot live with guilt of what I have done. I was always a really positive person. I always thought, no matter what went wrong in life, I had my kids. Now I feel that I have completely ruined not only my life, but theirs and in a way that cannot be fixed. Family and friends have not been in touch since the funeral and I do not really feel this is the kind of thing anyone could understand. I feel a weird kind of calm when I think of not being here any longer. I have completely ruined everything.",1
"I have been molested till age 7 (Idk when it started). I have been bullied throughout school. Never got good grades. No skills. No passion. Ugly. Fat.

"Here we are again, the dark place in my mind that is convincing me I need to kill myself. I am completely alone, with no one to talk to that truly wants to hear my feelings and that is never going to change. No one cares if I am alive or dead, even my parents apparently. I have got this straight razor pressed against my wrist , but the guilt of having others take care of what is left of me is desperately keeping me away from doing it. I want to die , I need to die now. I do not know what the fuck else to do, and call this a cry for help call it whatever, but I am beyond over this life. Its been a good time , but I do not see myself succeeding in this environment. I am going to kill myself",0
Help me feel better. I thought Id be long gone by now. Its inhibited me from moving on with my life. I am 21 and quarantine kicked me out of school so I am stuck with my thoughts.

"You see inspirational posts all day and they are bull. This one especially, ""give your mind a break, do not worry about working or socializing 24/7"". To everyone saying this you do realize that we live in a system that requires unhealthy lacks of mental health? Plus the people posting these usually look down on or hate on people they do not see as ""successful"" or get upset when someone cannot make it to a social event. Everyone around me is telling me to focus on my health but these are the same people telling me every day how much is at stake if I do not succeed or beg me to hangout all the time. They make fun of mutual friends who ""are in a bad place"". The hypocrisy makes me even more sick on a daily basis. Fakeness of ""Give your mental health a break""",0

"I have been dealing with depression for most of my life but the past 6 months have honestly been some of the hardest, I am 23 and I still live at my moms house but everyday I wake up I feel like loser and I have no motivation to do anything. I honestly feel amazing now though. A week ago my moms shitty boyfriend apparently was black out drunk and talking shit about me, I confronted him the next day (when we were all sober) he said he was sorry and said he did not remember. I knew that was bullshit but hearing the apology made me back off because I thought there would be a fight. I go and sit down afterwards and I felt washed over with dread and disappointment in myself because I should have done something. I felt like a bitch and I just got metaphorically slapped in the face. Well on the 4th of July hes at my moms house again. We shake hands and make up, I poured us some drinks and he grilled food, next thing I know he is swinging his fists on my mom. And I had enough, I stopped the fight but he punched me in the face a few times so I grabbed his neck with my arm and swung him over my hip on the ground in front of me. (I am not a fighter, I love people and I always try my best to not fight) he ended up on top of me and he starting punching me in the face again. I got up and called the cops (do not hate me, this is his 4th domestic violence issue) they come and arrest him. I feel good for actually standing up for my mom but feel like a bitch again because I never actually swung on him. A couple hours goes by and HE COMES BACK. This time he came out on the front porch. it is about 12 feet off the ground and there is a huge steep wooden staircase and at the top of the stairs there is a glass door. I kept telling him to get in his truck and leave, he was clearly drunk. He sucker punched me in the left side of my head and before I could even think I was already grabbing his shirt and running him through the front porch, next thing I know the glass door is shattering and this man flew all the way to the bottom. Called the cops again because he violated a protective order and that is basically the end of it. I know this sub is about depression but I feel more manly and the least amount of depressed than I have in years, I have already got a workout routine and I am looking for jobs again. For some reason throwing someone through a glass door just gave me the confidence booster I never knew I needed 10/10 would try, no I am joking but I hope I did not break any rules with this post. If I did I am sorry. I have been depressed for a very long time and after what happened my confidence went sky high. Or it could be due to a mean concussion lmao. What a 4th of July",0

I have to say my happiness gone my mind is numb. I have suffered with physical pain with my spine and dental problems. I have trouble eating swallowing things does not work. I am waiting on an operation. I am totally aware of how this should not be the case when I have so much good around me. I am so grateful for the effort that has been spent on trying to give me a boost into living in this society. I have a holiday booked and still just do not have hope. I turned to Reddit I cannot turn to anyone or cannot bring myself to worry them. Lost soul",1
"My life feels like its slowly getting worse, wtf is wrong with me?here is my story, despite all these things happening it feels like I was happier at the time than I am now.1. Married an abusive psychopath of a woman, divorced about 5 years ago which was probably the best thing I have ever done for myself, did not get 50-50 custody of the kids.2. Dated someone really unstable after that, extremely messy breakup have not really been able to love or bond the same since.3. Burnt out at work shortly after. Before that I was on the line for a huge promotion. Since then I have never been able to focus or get through work like I used to. Started to struggle with suicidal thoughts 4. Met a really great woman that loves me way more than I deserve, supports me all the time. Its so weird I feel like a she will of the person I used to be and must suck to be around, why does she feel like this?5. Ongoing custody battle.6. Found another job which although not the promotion I had once hoped for pays really well and is my ideal job.At around 3 the depression hit, I hopped on meds for 6 months until the suicidal feelings passed, but after that I stopped taking the meds.Up until about then, I was still able to find joy in life, really small things like taking a walk, taking some photos, getting coffee, hanging out with a friend. I feel like my life has never recovered from items 1,2 and 3.I feel stuck, in an emotional and mental limbo. I cannot think about fun things, or holidays. I do not look forward to anything or want to be around people. COVID Lockdowns have just made it all worse.Am I still depressed? I must be, but I just do not know how to kickstart my life again. Real question, am I depressed? WTF is wrong with me?",0
I literally have no one except my mother.

"As much supportive as my bf is with my depression, its so fucking scary to tell someone that would never do this that if it was possible to kill myself painlessly, I would. I think I got to the conclusion today that my life is not going to get better if I do not admit this. However it feels like such a selfish thing to do bc I do not him fo worry all the time and this to mess with his mood. I feel like I am selfish with everyone for not caring bc I am so depressed, and then I also feel like its selfish if I tell someone that I would like to die bc of the burden I am putting on them. Please help me by saying how you told someone you felt this way and how they took it.Note: I am aware that I need a psychiatrist and probably taking meds How to explain to someone your suicidal thoughts",0
"I wish i had friends. that is basically it. My high school life is incredibly boring, I have not had a healthy and proper friendship for a while now. I used to have a friend group but they kind of just left me behind I think, they still hangout together, nowadays when they see me in the hall we just say hi. the only time people actually talk to me is in class when they are asking about work, and even that rarely happens. in the normal school day, i only talk to one or two people, and those conversations do not even go past a minute. when i go home, i see people meet up with each other and plan out after school or weekends, and i kind of just wish i had that. I have been feeling like this since i started high school, but nothing has really changed. I feel like I am missing out on so much of my life because I have not been making good memories. Even outside of school i have trouble. I am going to this camping trip that my family and a bunch of other friends and family go to every year and i have been too scared or embarrassed to talk with the people my age. I kind of tried once, but it was difficult because i had nothing to really talk about, but everyone else there had no trouble getting along because they i think they hang out very frequently. everything i do nowadays is less interesting and i feel like I am being a disappointment to my parents because all i really do is school work. I do not go outside anymore to hangout with people, and I have lost motivation to go back to my sports and activities because to be honest, I cannot be bothered to deal with the bullshit and the awful and awkward feeling of trying to start conversations. Everything to me is boring now, even the video games i used to enjoy. I feel less motivated to do my school work (when school was in session) but i still do good in class because i have this feeling where if i get less than an A I am a disappointment because i basically do not do anything else beside school. every year my summer break is boring, except for the vacations. I spend everyday just essentially doing nothing. I am on the computer half of the time and i get bored. I watch tv and I am bored. I go outside and go on walks and to the mall and I am bored, and that usually makes me feel worse because i see everyone else hanging out. I do not think anyone has gotten the sense that i feel this way because i usually just act happy in school and around my parents. I still tell them that i hang out with people in school but not outside but tbh that is not really true. I wish Id stay and actually learn a sport or something like basketball once most people who play sports are pretty sociable and have friends. I dunno. I have not told anyone this because they might think I am complaining. I have a very good life and I am thankful that my parents are there to provide for me, but something just feels lacking, not on their part but on mine. I pretty much have nothing to do nowadays and i wish i did. Sorry if this seems cluttered, I am just venting this out finally. I do not know how to explain it, but i feel empty and useless most of the time. Why cannot i make friends",0
"My doctor is switching me from cipralex to welbutrin and I am just wondering if anyone has any experience with these two. Copralex is good, it is served me best out of everything else I have been on but it also has not gotten me out of my usual mood of pure apathy or anxiety. I have almost 0 interest in doing anything. I am scared of switching medications just because I do not know how I will react to it. I have pretty bad anxiety, and the side effects mention that it might make anxiety worse. I do not want it to make me feel worse or affect my sex drive which is already lower because of antidepressants. it is just an all around shit show. Any information or words or encouragement would be very appreciated. I am so sick of this. Help please? Doctor is switching my medication",0

I do not have anything to live for really. My life is in shambles... And its only going to get worse. I do not want him to be alone in his last moments... I cannot do that though... I cannot encourage him to die in anyway. I would save him if I could but I am helpless and worthless and I cannot even save myself. I do not make post... I do not know how to ask for help...

I have always been depressed and it all blew up a few years ago and i ended up having to quit public school and attend therapy for the first time. I really clicked with her and went to her for a year+ and felt the happiest I have ever been but she decided to stop seeing me after learning of my issues with self harm and i was transferred to a new therapist.they quit after 2 appointments and now i have this current one who i do not click with at all and do not see myself improving with her. I have been waiting to see her inhouse psychiatrist for months to finally get my medicine changed and ughhh just nothing is progressing or getting better. My mom keeps promising she will switch me but that is been said for 7 months now. i just want to talk to my old therapist again or just quit therapy all together its just not working out for me. id rather rot in bed and be depressed all the time. bit of a rant sorry I am just not sure what to do. missing my past therapist,0

"There supposedly was a time (or maybe just a fantasy) when life was semi enjoyable, when happiness was easily achieved. It seems so far back it may as well be myth. In current times there is been a near-to constant battle with wishes to commit suicide. They became so intense that we made the unfair decision to give one part the responsibility of holding those feelings for the rest of us, because we knew together we would be unable to keep from going through with it. Since then we all have gone through life, each getting our own various interests and having superficial friends, but the one in charge of the frustration at how meaningful other people's lives have become with time while ours remains empty has continually made sure noone has been able to get close to us. They know that deep relationships act like shackles, trapping us in this shtsack world out of concern for the effect our suicide would have on them. it is been a game of chess, wanting freedom from the pain of life but also avoiding what it would take to gain it; wanting to have meaning to life but avoiding the things that might give it. Life is a bunch of worthless distractions from becoming free",1
"hi I am feeling one of the worst I have felt in my life and the older i get, the more i just become hopeless. i always dream of better days and a time when I am not riddled with fears and anxiety because life could be so beautiful but i seem to only attract negativity, i can not even describe the pain my soul is feeling. and i do not even know where to start but i just need to write its my only comfort at the moment as I am having severe pain in my lung from beeing a chainsmoker for years and I am daily paranoid of death or cancer. even just writing this everything is so exhausting,,, sometimes i do not even have the power to get up and get something to drink, not because I am lazy I am just so tired of life and disapointent, i give all the little power i have and still without my parents and friends help I would drown for sure. as a man I am sad to know that most women are not attracted to a depressed and skinny guy and i have not had a girlfriend in 10 years... i have not hugged kissed or cuddled with a girl in 10 years and I am dying inside, i just need to get it off my chest I have been thinking about sharing this on reddit for whatever reason for a longer time... and i always spoon with my pillow and imagine i have a girlfriend and everyday I am just afraid to die without ever knowing how it feels to be loved... and the pain in my lung at the moment is just scaring me to death, id be happy if someone would just chat with me a little thank you if you have read the whole post i appreciate it my friend Hopeless",0
it is one of those things that I will probably never get used to. I cannot meet my own gaze without wanting to cry.

No one has ever looked at me like that.,0
"Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY. I just never feel enough, be it in my family, my friendships, or my relationship. Whatever I do, I can never be good enough. At this point, I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy, all I remember is feeling sad, that is IT, THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings, I hate getting attached, I hate trusting someone, I have my mother, I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate, but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me. I lost myself and I cannot seem to find her again. It just does not get fucking easy, it is just torture. why am I never good enough?",0

"This is going to sound petty as fuck, but I have been extremely depressed recently due to a girl. I have really like this girl since high school, and were in college now. Unfortunately, a couple of months ago, I tried asking her out and was rejected. Now I see she is with another guy who I knew and strongly disliked*. Ill admit it though, hes a dime. Attractive, athletic, from a good family, and he puts on a good front that hes a real nice guy. In reality though, hes a scumbag who looks down upon anyone who is not a girl hes interested in, or someone he has to suck up to in order to look better. Hes treated me like a cockroach in the past.Anyway, seeing this girl I really liked with him is torture. It brings out all my little insecurities like: I am not as good as him, Ill never be enough, I am a coward, etc.I am only 20 and the thought of me ending my own life this early is saddening, but I also do not see any other way out. My life has fallen apart and its my fault.Anyways, this was mainly just a rant not really expecting any replies tbh. She chose another guy over me",0

"Hi,I am a 28 year old (she will of a) man from the UK suffering with **severe** depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment, now I am what I call, stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had, everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught, distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved, distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day, I have been stuck alive, too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything, believe anything, want anything, feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it, my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me, he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair, I know this is happening I just cannot stop it, meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a full-time alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself, I am open-minded, but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore, pre-pandemic I was doing my dream job, still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available, being mistreated at each company of course, I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our pre-existing issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child, people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate, like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help, albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all, I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness, I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted, I do not need money I just want fulfillment, I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate, I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? I Am Dead",1

He did not get the message (or did not care ) and kept trying to get me to give in. I did, I was tired and feeling pretty unworthy/unlovable. I did not want to be alone, missed feeling wanted and felt generally ""if not him now, then who later"". I beat myself up over this for too long and worked through the shame of it all.My sex drive is pretty high so during this time it is kind of added to my depression but I think it is good that I took a time out. Now, I am genuinely in a headspace where I want to only worry about myself and be selfish with my desires.How bad for my mental health would it be for me to look for someone to strictly just have sex with and not do the whole "" this is who I am, who are you and do we match"" thing? I have always done it and it is basically only ever exhausted me.I know my worth yaddayadaya I am horny and sad, is this going to be detrimental overall (undo healing)? Is there a healthy way to do this for me? I have been sexless for a year",0
"I am too chicken to kill myself but I have no will to live. Some days I am tricked into thinking life is actually worth living and that I should keep going but then I am right back to being a dead husk of a human, its honestly exhausting.

"I am a 24 year old female, I have been diagnosed with depression since 16 and been on multiple tablet, citalopram, escitalopram, setroline, propranolol and I am sick of the side effects. I sleep my life away, I can sleep for 14+ hours a day, I struggle to get out of bed, I have put on weight I cannot shift and my libido is none existent. I am currently fighting my hardest to get prescribed bupropion but I am in the UK and nobody is willing to listen to me. I feel like I am going to overthink myself to death. I give myself migraines everyday from constant thinking, I am highly controlled by the weather, if its a muggy rainy day I will not get out of bed. I am just sick of being like this, last time I came off my citalopram I had a mental breakdown so I know they are doing something just not enough and not in the right areas. Please help any opinion is welcomed Cry for help",0

"Its late at night where I am. So I usually stay up late due to my work and personal life. It gives me a break from everything &amp; everyone which I weirdly enjoy now. Used to be a social butterfly but I have kept to myself so much, its odd to compare me now to who I was 2 years ago. I barely talk to most of them now.My thing is when I am going through severe anxious and depressive episodes I tend to isolate. And by that I mean I am so ashamed of where I am mentally that I do not want other people to see me like that at all. It feels like its shameful. This last episode is like no other there is been things in my life going on that have stripped any sense of consistency.Reflecting on who I used to be is what kills me the most. It feels awful that I am stuck in this cycle, but I feel like I need to get out of it because no one wants to be around a Debby downer, I understand. I have been there with others.I want out. I want to get out of this cycle but my standards for myself are high, because I do not want to be someone who I would not have wanted to be around (if that makes sense).I am genuinely just jaded, tired, exhausted. I know if I cannot be my best self then there is no point in presenting myself to new people. I have been lonely lately due to this mindset.If anyone has been in a similar place PLEASE let me know if you have found a way to cope. Can someone relate at all (22f)?",0
"Tomorrow is the only day off I have for the next two weeks so I am drinking as an excuse for the roller coaster of emotions I am going to have working 10 hours a day.

"I should say at the outset that I am a survivor of 20 years of suicidal ideation. Please do not accuse me of making light of this subject, I have a right to. (As I believe everyone does, if they do it with love, but that is another story.)My motivations are as follows:1. Expose the ridiculousness that is as inherent in suicide as it is in every action. 2. Replace upsetting brainworms (actual plans) with scenarios which scratch the itch but are also amusing or distracting, or are calming because they are obviously fantasy. I have seen this approach taken, without the above reasoning made explicit, in an old blog I came across once. The only one I can remember is from a standing start, drive your head full-speed at the pavement. It could have been considered a hateful site I guess, but I do not think it came from that place, and I found it hilarious and calming.Please share the most hilarious and fucked up suicide methods that have occurred to you. Ill start with one that recurs to me. I would not wish it on another who never thinks of suicide, but for anyone that does, I hope that it occurs to you in a bad moment, to bring you humour and remind you that you are not alone.So here is my funniest suicide method:Hanging via bungee cord in front of a train. The train hits, and any remains left attached to the stretched rope are comedically pinged back in the opposite direction, disappearing from view near the end of their arc.(I know that this would not work and I know that train drivers deserve better. Realism and empathy with hypothetical characters are not the point here, ok? If its that shit, write a better one and that can be my comedy suicide brainworm) Funny suicide methods?",1
"I just do not think I am cut out to live. My birth was a mistake and a dumb joke. I am a nuisance to myself and everyone around me. I am a failure, a laughingstock. I wish I could just die. If only I had the courage to pull the trigger, but guess what? I am a coward too, I am afraid. I doubt anyone will care seeing as I am so insignificant. I want out now. I wish I could just go to sleep and die.",1

"My spine is messed up (disc protrusion) and doctors say it is too mild to risk spine surgery, but nevertheless it hurts 24/7, I have been in constant pain for years at this point. It cannot be fixed by massage, excersise or stretching. Usually I am quite used to it, but there are times I am just so sick and frustrated about it. I believe it also contributes greatly to my depression. MAKE IT GO AWAY, FUCK! IT HURTS ALL THE TIME I am in constant pain and I grow really tired of it",0
"I cannot get it out of my head. I want to be dead. I want to kill myself. I keep imagining taking a belt and wrapping it around my neck and hanging myself. Would it even work? I fucking hate everything and everyone. I cannot do any of this anymore. what is FUCKING WRONG WITH ME. I have NEVER BEEN GOOD ENOUGH. WHO CAN I BLAME BESIDES MYSELF. I HATE EVERYONE SO FUCKING MUCH. I FUCKING HATE EVERYONE!!!!I do not do anything I am a fucking loser. A loner. A pathetic, selfish, stupid piece of shit. Why cannot I just feel normal. Why cannot I just be fucking happy for once. My whole world feels like a fucking mess. I feel like a disorganized and stupid bastard. I cannot think clearly. I cannot focus on anything. How did this all fucking happen. How did we get here I need to go. I need to fucking leave. I cannot do any of this. I cannot do it. I just went on a terrible rampage and said things to my bf that I do not mean and should not have said. I am pushing him away with every emotional outburst. I am been self harming and all I feel is the sting of my cuts that is distracting me now at least. I do not want to be alive anymore.",1
"...but only when you get it.it is becoming more and more frustrating with _anything_ that I do there is always something negative people need to interject with. Never constructive. it is to the point where even small things are bothering me and that is becoming an issue. The biggest thing that gets me are these attitudes of X does it better so you are invalid or Y has it worse so you are invalid. It really makes you feel small and like a nobody.Time and time again I will try something again and it just ends up in the same place. Nobody genuinely cares, which is why I rarely bother anymore to reach out and express things. I am in this alone and just need to deal with it I suppose. When there is nobody to advocate for you, you just need to do it yourself. it is very hard to pick yourself up when you are in a tough spot.Am I letting the negative win? For now yes and I hate that. I really wish things could be different sometimes. Living a happier life will come in time I hope. Thanks for stopping by whoever you may be out there- Positive Reinforcement Goes a Long Way",0
"Title sums it up. I have not made it into work and I called in sick. The truth is that I am really struggling mentally at the moment but I did not say that when I called.

The guilt is all consuming though. Just not sure what to do. Feeling guilty about lying",0

It feels like my heart and brain were not made for the world that we live in.

I really messed up, and I do not know how to fix this. I do not understand people, so I have no idea what to say. Please do not say things about how I am a bad friend or person, I already know that.

"I am not sure what to say, I am sure there are people here dealing with way more than I am. I have been having so many suicidal thoughts over the past month. My best friend moved to another province. I do not really have a lot of friends I can confide in. The few friends I can confide in I do not want to bother them. I am not hysterical... but I just do not want to be here anymore. I feel like life just is not for me anymore. I go to counseling, I take meds (I am bad at being consistent). It all seems like its in vain. I tried to cut my carotid artery this past Friday but the box cutter blade was stupid dull so I stoped (I was definitely hysterical that day). I am just so tired of it all. Extremely Lonely",1

Nothing in my life will get better. I have tried to better my life and it does not work. Everyone in my life has either hurt me in some way that I cannot forgive, or have been hurt by me in some way that I cannot forgive myself for. I feel disgusting. I am a disgusting person with a disgusting body and a disgusting, sick brain that makes me think disgusting, sick thoughts. 7/10 people with my personality disorder attempt suicide, 10% will be successful.

So recently i got blackmailed for the 2nd time in 4 years and i just feel like shit. My passed resurfacing all over again. Its like all i am is nudes i took years ago when i was not even of age. Its scary to go out and live in fear if they would traffic me while i am on my way to school or to a store or where ever. I wear over sized clothes and always cover my face because i live in fear for my life. Some would say this is a bit much but if i tell you i had almost gotten close to being trafficked you would be doing the same. I just need someone to help put my mind at ease so i do not submit to their demands. I eat very little and sleep enough to get by. But i just need something to get me through tonight. I need help,0
"When people talk about depression its usually about the sadness part, or loss of interest, and distancing. But one big factor of it is the loneliness. That feeling that you are alone. No matter how loving friends and family are and supportive, that loneliness is still there. It eats at you, making your self consciousness to kick in. Making you hate yourself, making you think that you are a failure, that no one will ever love you. It truly hurts. Its an emptiness inside you that you feel cannot be filled. Nothing takes away this pain for long. Its tiring, and draining. I want to curl up in a ball and cry, but i cannot. I have to fake it. Fake being happy, fake being warm and fuzzy. Fake a smile, fake enjoyment. Fake everything. I just want it to end. I just want to stop feeling so alone in this world. I just want to feel loved and appreciated. I want to be understood. I want to be cared for. But my mind will not let me reach out to people. It will not let me get the help i need. I always hold back the truth. No matter who I am talking too. I am so drained and i just want to stay in bed all day, but I cannot because I have responsibilities. Why did this have to happen to me. Why do i have to live with this thing that constantly eats away at me. Why do i have to go through my day like nothing is wrong. why does my medicine not work. it just makes me numb. the only thing that I have experienced that has actually helped it the gym and weed. and i cannot do those things all day every day. I just want to be happy again. i just want this all to end. My depression",0
"No idea where my life is going. Feeling depressed everyday. Medication is not working and is causing me constipation and making me more irritable. Life seems to be upside down. Everything annoys me and irritates me. But yet, at the worst point right now, i feel relaxed. I think sometimes when we are given too much control of our lives, when life is ""perfect"", we feel less happy, waiting for the next best thing. that is for me at least. My life is, objectively quite shit right now, yet i feel, as a result of a loss of control of my life, safe. i feel i can make the best out of every day despite feeling like crap. Holding on",0

The last 2 weeks have been so hard. I do not think I can continue. My stomach looks like a chess board covered in blood. I do it on my chest because its harder to find. I have 1 reason so live and that is it. And so many more not to. I cannot go on anymore,1
"I just wanted to write this out but do not know exactly where then I remember reddit is the only account nobody in my family and friends knows. Well, this is my first time writing this kind of thing so please be patient with me.When I was still at school (I am an adult now) I sometimes think about suicide because of how bad my environment and the people around me treated my family, but I could never ever do it because it will make things even worse for my mom and I never have the courage to do so.But ever since I lived far away (because of work) from anyone I know throughout my school years I have never thought of suicide for one bit despite having lots of hardship, that is until I have to go back home. ""Family"" and ""friends"" I never believe in whatever that term is supposed to mean, they say ""family/friends will always be there to support you""...f-ing bullshit.Well what I am trying to say is every time I am around family/friends (basically people I know throughout my school years) it always makes me feel like reliving my younger self and I hated everything about my childhood I f-ing hate it because it makes me feel like I can never do anything and always thinks that suicide is the answer even though I know it is not.Writing this down made me calm and I already forgot some of the things that I was struggling with at that moment. I do wish to move away again and do therapy but financially speaking that is not an option.To whoever is reading this I thank you and if my words are quite hard to understand I am still learning to better my english. Oh and I am trying to make this as short as possible. Trying to stop thinking about suicide",1

To sum it up very fast, hes been depressed on/off for a long time, but a few months ago, attempted suicide, went to the hospital, had therapy sessions for a month (did not work), fight with a doctor for pills, and tonight hes revealed the pills do not work like he thought, and he is still very depressed, and he tries his best to silence suicidal thoughts, but they are still there (even though he says the pills make them fuzzy). I personally have OCD and suffered from it for a while, and had a depressive stint a few years ago, but even after my mental health journey, and giving him the tips I can for finding hope, I do not believe hes catching on, or seeing reason to try. I do not know what to tell him, or help him anymore with, so if anybody has suggestions on what he should maybe do next, please let me know. I need some help for a friend here.",0

"Lately I have been trying to improve myself. I have taken up a lot of new stuff, tried changing the way I do things. A lot of it is helping, and generally I do feel more fulfilled. But I feel like things are starting to crack. When I go out drinking with friends I have these moments where I pour my soul out to someone. Sometimes its great, I let them know how much I care about them, stuff like that. But sometimes I concern myself when I think back to other moments. I basically begged a friend to live his best possible life. I am just afraid that I am starting to push people away without realizing it. I was always in the good will come to me eventually mindset. But lately I have wanted to take a more active role in my life. I do not know how long Ill be here, I want my time to be good. It does not have to be perfect, it does not even have to be exciting. I just want to find someone, settle down. Start piecing shit together. I want to be content when I die. I have always been an introvert. I have also always been an empath. And I have a difficult time telling people how I really feel about them. I just do not know what to do. I feel like my world is shifting into something new, something foreign. I have started over so many times before. Each time I feel less and less like myself. I just want something to stay for once.

Plain and simple I feel like no one truly listens to me, my mood swings are unbearable and I just cannot stop thinking of self harm and suicide. Self harm as a punishment for not killing myself yet or failing. My options are leave everything and do not come back, walk until I cannot anymore, kill myself or suffer. I have been told different things like, it is extreme depression and anxiety or psychosis, now it is a personality disorder and I am just like????? Okay?? Which one is it?? Part of me feels like there is no point writing this. I might even have the courage to do it who knows. I seriously do not get the fucking point.",1
"I irreparably damaged a relationship with a friend of mine by saying a lot of stupid controversial shit. I am not proud of what I said and its undeniably awful, and I will not be sharing it, but it came from a lotta angst I had been bottling up for the last several months. I honestly do not care too much about the relationship but I am disturbed that I said this shit and hurt my former friend like that. My shit mental health is not an excuse for basically abusing someone like that. What I did was pathetic and I rightly despise myself for it. I am sick and tired of people putting up with my dumbass all the time I wish they would just wisen up and tell me to hang myself or something, maybe then I could get the balls to actually end it. Said some stuff",0
"I tried for years trying to turn myself into something I am not and now I wasted about 3-4 years of my life. I verbally abused someone I cared about all because I wanted her to be in the light while I get swallowed in darkness. I lost her forever and could not properly communicate that I wanted to be away from her for her own good. I want to turn myself in to the police for abusing and harassing someone but would prefer suicide. I also want to die for abandoning myself and everyone that knew me. I will probably put an end to myself after Isshiki's revival and death in the Boruto anime, though I probably will not last that long. Regrets",1
"I am first generation. My parents stayed together because of religious reasons, but there was a lot of emotional and physical abuse. Typical I think a lot of first gen suffer like this. Now as an adult I am having trouble being emotionally stable, I feel helpless at these feelings, and depression takes over. I know I cannot change the past, but now I have difficulties making adult friends, because I was so limited, I was not allowed to have friends over, My parents fought with family so even family connection was limited. My dad was always angry if I came out of my room he was yelling at how useless I was, so now I realize Idk how to be with people. People think I am so weird. I am so tiered of having such a hard time at being human, I crave emotional connection and I do not have it. I used to think of everything so religiously because that was embedded into me, now I am always doubting if god exist and if life is pointless. Its hard to stay positive, idk what to do with my life and if I do not do anything doctorly I am a failure to my parents. What is up with foreign parents wanting all their kids to be doctors? I started therapy its been 3 sessions and right away she wanted to put me on antidepressants, and I tried it, I had the worst idk what to call it, I started taking the anti depressants and I am like, why is life? I should just die. And I was sleepy all the time, so I stopped, I do not want anti depressants I need something and idk what. This is a desperate late night vent, thanks for reading. I needed a venting source, here I am",0

"I lost my business because I did not want to work with a man who physically hurt me. He messed with my car. He caused legal issues in my life. I fell for more bullshit today which means I am still an easy mark for his cons which makes me paranoid about starting another business. He told me crazy shit about the man I am in love with and everyone wants it to my fault. I lost my job because I fell in love with my boss, and he has a girlfriend who continues to make my life a living Hell. This woman has ruined my life medically, financially, emotionally and worse. I have an ex who filmed me giving her a blowjob to hurt me and the man I am in love with. She convinced my dad to financially cut me off, and worse. She told my coworkers that I am schizophrenic and worse. She may or may not be responsible for 2 cars being totaled. She cyberstalks me and prevents me from getting work done. I have another ex who wants everything I do to be about some symbolic bullshit that means I still love him, which has also made my life a living Hell. My friends think I want to fuck their boyfriends because I fell in love with my boss who has a girlfriend, and she is now convinced them that I love all their boyfriends. Embarrassing moments of my life have been publicized - including pimple popping, showering, masterbating, etc. I just do not want to be made fun of for it. The man I am in love with would not care if I died. I do not know how much of my life is a lie. I do not know if I buried my cat alive because of these people. I get reminded every day that exes master ate to me and do not want me to be happy. I get blamed for all of it, and its cruel. I do not want to participate in this life",0

"Out of all the possible realities we could have been born into, we were born into a reality where selfishness, violence, greed, and murder are embedded into surviving in life. The rules are that we have to kill and dismantle other living creatures and consume their molecules to stay alive. does not matter if you are doing the killing or someone else is. It has to be done. This is not about an anti-meat or pro-veganism stance. it is just the hard realization for how things actually are here, that cruelty and selfishness is deeply rooted in nature and there is no escaping that.it is amazing that we started out with just water, air, and sunlight. I often wonder how different life would be if eating was an optional luxury, or to prevent social inequalities, if eating was poisonous.What point is there to life when most of one's life is spent wanting to exist in alternative worlds?Of course, we cannot control how nature works and has decided to be. To stop eating meat and plants would consistently result in a slow and painful death. We do not have any other options here. The cruel reality of Nature itself is depressing",0
"I do not know if this is a depression thing or not, but pretty much my heart can run up to 90bpm but I can still fall asleep with so much ease. Sometimes I cannot even stay awake even though my heart will be like that. Anyone else experience this? it is been this way for me for many years. I can drink a lot of caffeine and still fall asleep if I want to. it is easier to prompt myself to stay awake with caffeine consumption, but if I want to sleep, it is no problem. TLDR: Anyone get a fast heartbeat yet still sleepy as hell? Racing heart but still sleepy as fuck",0

"I am not strong enough. I am not strong enough for this life. My entire existance has been reduced to coping with my mental problems. When I think about how many years I have left in this life....how much more pain I have left to experience....i know I will never find joy. I will never find a reason why it is worth it to go on.How can I say never? do not our feelings always change with time? I wish I could say so, but I know better. I have seen the people who never get better. Who end up alone and miserable into their 40s and 50s, their lives wasted. And I have seen it for myself, in a vision. It never ends. I am trapped, again. I cannot move in with him. I cannot spend day after day wishing I was someone else, somewhere else, anywhere else. I cannot stand having yet another conversation about breaking up, abput how he is done nothing wrong and it is just my head. he will never see that I will never, ever believe anybody could love me. That I will always envision him with other women, happier and no longer obliged to deal with my shit. When we met, I was a different person. I do not know what I am now. I do not know what to do. I have thought about running away, and the only reason why I do not is because I have too much expensive equiptment at my house I would have to abandon. But even if I did run away....where would I go? And I have to take mtself with me. I will just have the same problems over and over. There is not any escape. I am not strong enough. The only advice I ever get is life is what you make it and I hate, hate, hate hearing that. Because they are right. I am a loser. I was born a loser and I will live a loser and I will die a loser, and I know it is true, because I have seen it. Death is the best thing to hope for. it is the eternal sollution. Why there is no way out",1
"The worst thing about having depression for me is the numbness. I wish someone would have told me that I was not crazy, and that I could have gotten help earlier. So many people stopped talking to me, or they pushed me away for so many years. For the sheer fact that I was going through bad mental health. Sometimes I do not know whether to be happy about that or not. I think that my depression keeps me at a point my life where nothing really hurts anymore. Sometimes I feel this feeling of being inconvenienced, but I never feel any urges or any sadness anymore. I wake up restless and I go to sleep restless. I feel that every day I live is another circle I go around. Sometimes I ponder with the idea of death, but every time I come to the same conclusion. That regardless if I die or not neither one is worth it in the end. I feel like that idea is maybe me trying to find a reason to stay alive. I feel like I do not have anyone who truly understands the extent of depression. I do not know whether I really do either at times. Sorry if this is long, but I have not really had anyone to talk to, that I feel can really understand. I keep going in circles everyday with my depression",0

Up til now, I am about to go to college, I feel this insane pressure that supposedly you are supposed to know what you are going to do with the rest of your life at this point, you are supposed to be fully aware of yourself and know what to do. it is such a lie. we are sold to this belief that after University, take a job that your course is linked to, then you do that for the rest of your life, I mean, there is so much stuff out there that is not just higher education, being forced to dream on something that you are not entirely sure is just insanity, sometimes, all they want is for their child to have cool jobs so that they can brag on their friends of how great they are as a parent. It sucks, it truly is disgusting. there is so much things out there, getting pressured in an early age, cheating for grades for the subjects that you do not have any interests to.

I do not have the heart to tell anyone that I am on my way out. Everyone is going through shit and I do not want to add to it. I also do not think that the people I have curated relationships with would care. I have the kind of relationships that if I am not the one to check in on them, we could go months without talking to each other. It sucks, but I always budge and reach out because who else can I talk to?I have not felt loved in a really long time, if ever. I do not know if I am capable to love or if I am someone that can be loved. I know that if I left, it would destroy my family financially, so I have managed to stay this long. I know I am being used. I have called it out so many times, I sound like a broken record. My familial situation is not something I can easily break out of, and even if I did...where would I go? I have no one.

"I feel like an island. Over the past year it seems like I have drifted away from everyone in my life to the point where it feels like I have lost the ability to maintain meaningful relationships. I feel extremely isolated from others - like I am trapped in my own mind. People that used to make me really happy I now feel an indifference towards or worse they make me extremely angry. New people that come into my life seem so bland and uninteresting. Every interaction I have with another person feels so fake. All my responses in conversation feel rehearsed and not genuine; its like instead of actually being apart of a conversation, I am an actor that has their lines already memorized, or a robot with a set of pre-written responses. At the same time, I have developed a very short temper when it comes to talking to people. An otherwise benign statement or conversation topic will instantly sour my mood and when people make mistakes I just cannot seem to let it go and in my head I actively hold it against them. Everyone disappoints me. Maybe I should just isolate myself from society for a while and cut out all of my friends and family. If I do not, I worry that I will eventually hate anyone that ever cared for me. What the fuck is wrong with me I cannot connect with anyone",0

"I am 25, working as a quant in an investment bank for about two years after my graduation in 2019. The main problem that I face in my life is that I do not feel like doing anything at all. I have been on pills for 3 years now, been depressed for even more. I have a lot of trauma from my childhood which I have not been able to shake off yet.I am different because I get affected emotionally very easily and it totally gets to me. So called small things totally overpower me and I need time to recover. However the world being fast paced, i do not get that time so I have got to do my daily stuff in spite of that to ensure that I survive. My work is not stressful, it can be done by any sane living human with the drive to do it. But I cannot, I cannot make myself do even the smallest of things. What I feel like is just lying down and hoping it gets over. I know that is not how you get over things but I do not think I want to be what majority people term happy as. I do not feel peace and comfortable in that idea. What I feel happy about is kind of utopian, hence I do not spend much time thinking about it these days.I have been suicidal for almost a year and half. But given the failure that i , I have never attempted it since I was always afraid to die or hurt myself. I do not know a way out. Probably there is not one. What I do know is that I do not enjoy this existence I have on earth but I have got to go on hating every moment of it. And do things to survive even though I do not want to do or live through it at all.I mean, I never asked to be born. Just because two people had sex and wanted some meaning in their lives, I am here and now I have got to face all of these till idk when.I do not see a light at the end of this tunnel. I do not know what happens after death but that seems the only way out as that seems to be an end from this existence I have here.I do not feel things anymore. I have no hobbies, no likings or preferences, no inclination to any activity other than just lying down and overthink which is the because behind most of my mental issues - at least, that is what my psychiatrist said.

I cannot really blame her, because It is my fault after all - I got so helpless and depressed before for weeks prior to the breakup, which just broke us down. It is the primary reason why I am ending my life very soon. I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about an year, although I almost committed intentional suicide as a 10 year old. I have always hated myself.

"Idk how to ask this properly but if you are parents are kind of blinded by the stigma around mental health, can you use mild fictional scenarios and examples and try and have a discussion about everything in a way that does not directly or indirectly affect anyone. I am talking about telling them something that might not have happened irl but in a fictional reality and you just use it as a real world incident so you can simply have a polite and positive discussion with them about it to try to dissolve the stigma around depression, at least with your family, especially in young adults. I do not mean to be insensitive or inappropriate in anyway, I just think that this might be a way to have a healthy discussion with kind of conservative parents, to just better your relationship with them because maybe you will get a new perspective and that might turn out to be actually kind of healing. I am sorry if this sounded inappropriate in any way, I did not mean it. I just need some advice. Thank you. Idk who to ask so I am posting this here. it is a little long but I would be really glad if you could please answer.

Oops Haha lol wwyd if I just died tonight lol,1
Basically I was getting my life together just before my exams . that is what I really needed to be motivated to study to get decent grades. However today I had a fight with my dad. He told me I am a loser that the degree I chase after is useless and he does not want to see me anymore. That brought up past feelings in me since I had many fights with him in my past. The last few years our relationship was somewhat neutral. But now everything is going downhill and I am falling back down again. But yeah he is right I am a loser and a disgrace. I have tried for years to change it but I cannot go anymore. The pain is to much. I am thinking of getting drunk and drive against a tree or jump from a bridge. Fml. I was doing so good but now I just want to die.,1
"As the title suggests I had planned to kill myself last night. Precisely the plan was to electrocute myself as it does not really require a lot of prep. I will not go into details about the specific act due to the fear someone might attempt to recreate it. Anyways, that would have been my second suicide attempt, the first one being about a year and a half ago with me stabbing myself in the neck a few times. Not the most elegant suicide method I admit but I was not looking for something elegant at the time. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) about 3 years ago, changed a few therapists and medications but nothing helped enough. It just feels like life has just been postponing suicide since my first attempt. On the bright side, I have not self-harmed since then but hell do I want to sometimes. In every bridge, every speeding car, every kitchen knife, every rope, every policeman even all I see is a way to death. The main question that people might have from the title - Did I go through with it? No. Why? I do not know really, instead, I went for a run (which is usually a temporary mood boost for me but it goes away quite quickly) and then I was too tired to do it. Do I still want to do it? Yes, yes and yes. I only stopped myself today too because a friend of mine has her birthday today and I do not want to ruin it even if we are not really close. it is just all postponing but I am not sure until when. Anyways, thanks for your time, hope you are doing better! I had a suicide attempt planned for last night.",1

Now that smoking has became a problem I have no outlet. I have no way of making myself happy, because any other things that do make me happy are out of the question. I am the problem in everyone is life, and even they have said so. I do not know how I got to the point where I do not eat anymore. I hardly care about my appearance, or about anything in general. I do not know why I have not committed suicide yet. I am so unhappy with my life and anything I do, does not make it better. I am trying emotionally and physically to try and be happy, to try and do things to make myself happy, they only temporarily last. Ill only ever be temporarily happy, and then its gone. I do not know how to change, I have tried everything I could. I am more outgoing, I push myself outside of my comfort square, and yet it does not work. I do not know who I am anymore. I am someone who no one recognizes, I am someone who I hardly recognize. One way or another I know I am ever going to get better, and I probably will have to end up committing suicide. Its not like I actually want to die, I just do not want to have to live like this anymore. I do not even recognize myself anymore",0
"In 2018 I went to college abroad, and while I had a great time living there, the program was not well run nor did I put in the work and I ended up at home with my parents after one semester. In the fall on 2019 I started school again, had one pretty good semester, then in early 2020 as you are all aware the world shut down. I was in complete isolation, strict quarantine with my parents from March 2020 to April 2021.I made it through my first three semesters at community college largely without incident despite my degrading mental health, until Spring 2021, my last semester before earning an associates degree. In the previous semesters, I had cheated heavily. Which honestly I do not morally have an issue with given online school, but in the Spring 2021 I decided I was done cheating and was going to do it the hard way.Until I did not. I was so close. And then I just stopped. Failed 3 of my 5 classes. I do not know what happened really, it just stopped feeling real, days and weeks went by and then I would see ""missed test"" and ""missed lab"" etc etc.My plan was to take my associates and transfer from my communtiy college to a 4 year university. I had to email them and tell them what I just described above, and how quarantine made me depressed, but that was in the past and it would never happen again.Until it did. I retook the 3 classes I failed in the spring, and I am going to fail 2 of the 3. AGAIN. My physics does not even require work. The answers to all the tests, quizzes, and homeworks are online. The prof does not care. And I just refused to do one assignment over the past 8 weeks. Now my transfer institution is going to reject me, my parents are going to flip shit, and I will go back to being the dissapointment I am after failing school for the first, second, and now third time.I do not know how to change. I do not know how to get better. I had something special. A really fucking beautiful, awe worthy opportunity to get a real degree in engineering. To graduate like my brothers. And now its gone.it is not the time I am worried about. I am 22 I have plenty. it is not money, these community college classes are manageable. it is just that I keep making deeper and deeper cuts, chopping myself down as often as possible.I run. I go to the gym. I know how to cook. I meditate. I keep my room orderly. I read when I can. I work. All these tenets of my life, just crippled architecture on a broken, decaying framework. I do not know what my point is. it is just that it hurts, and because it hurts I hurt. I hurt because I hurt myself, and it hurts knowing how bad I hurt myself, if that makes sense. Continual Self-Sabotaging",0
"I am tired. I am 27. I have been struggling all my life. I cannot get over childhood abuse, I was tortured by parents, specially mother, and I mean physical abuse until I was like 15.

Depression is not something I talk about much but I just wanted to say that men saying that females go through no depression actually makes me more depressed. It kind of downgraded the situation females are in. I am not saying that men at times do not have it harder when it comes to expressing their feelings. But as a girl I never got to express my feeling because I am too scared. Depression,0

"Every job I have had I have absolutely fucking despised. Right now I am a cleaner and work nights so I do not have to interact with anyone but I hate the job. Every time I complain about it I get ""well someone has to do it"" or ""it is a really important job. Especially right now during a pandemic."" The thing while I am there all I want to do is go home so I put in minimum effort and do it as quick as I can.I have never been in a relationship. I cannot talk to anyone without getting extreme bouts of anxiety. I do not know why anyone would go out with me I have barely even got a personality and my life is such a mess it is a joke. I have not made any new friend since highschool. The only way I keep in contact with my old friends is when we used to play games together but I have been to depressed to do that in ages it just feels like effort. Effort to play and effort to talk.I have got very little contact with my family. it is not even like we are on bad terms or anything we just do not talk. I have never got anything new to share about my life anyway so I do not even know what to talk about. I go weeks with out washing and my laundry never gets ironed or folded. I do not really eat out that much and try to eat healthy. I only drink water and go for walks whenever I have got the energy but that is not that often. I try and put myself out there and find new hobbies all the time but nothing ever sticks. I force myself to go on hikes or to the beach or out to a bar at least once a week but I never enjoy myself.It takes me hours to get out of bed in the morning. I sleep way too much and daydream an unhealthy amount. No matter what I do I always feel fatigued.I do not even have a reason to be depressed. it is not like I have gone through some kind of trauma or been through a bad breakup. This is just who I am. it is who I have been for the last 5 years with no end in sight. I go to a psychologist I have been on various antidepressants for years but It never gets better. I do not really want to die. I want like anything to he able to enjoy life. But I cannot keep living like this where everything i do is an uphill battle. Where I have got to put in enormous amounts of effort just to do things that come naturally to most people and then not even be happy after putting in all the effort.I try to improve but everytime anxiety, depression or fatigue is always there to pull me back down.I was not made for life. I cannot imagine living another 40 years like this. Life was not made for me. I am not even sure what to do at this point.",0

Every year all I feel is dread because I just know that it is going to get worse. Jobs becoming scarce, people going insane, shit becoming more expensive, climate going wack, etc. The fuck can I do about it now? I barely buy shit or go out. The recent heatwave has actually left me feeling suicidal. I am tired of stupid fucking doomers and preppers bragging about their fancy bunkers and their shitty stale canned food that they will be forced to subsist on for the rest of their lives. I am tired of billionaire fuckers denying that anything bad is happening because they have not experienced it themselves. I am tired of being reminded that I WILL FUCKING DIE SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY just for being alive at the wrong period of time. Just fucking kill me with one of your fancy guns!I cannot be honest with anyone about how I really feel because it is a one way ticket to homelessness or worse. The feeling that I do not belong here is only getting more pervasive every day.

"I am 26. When I was a teenager, probably early teenager, I had likea prophecy slip into my head: I was going to be dead at 30.And its always made sense to me, dying by 30. In a way its a little bit of a relief: just a couple more years then natures going to pull the plug on me. But its also scary. Like what if I am in my 30s and this dumb body is chugging along??But ever since I was 21, I have only got x more years in this world can you shut the fuck upI joke to people all the time, I am going to be dead by 30. I was not built to last.And ever since I was 25, people ask where do you see yourself in 5 years. I honestly have to bullshit that. Because I REALLY think I am going to be dead. By freak illness. Or freak accident. Maybe someone will send an assassin after me!!!I think of all the creatives that die just short of 30. The forever 27 club.

"In a week I will be gone and this message will be a fragment of who I was. I have to do it, not only because I am in pain but to make sure I never inflict pain again. People say it is selfish but they do not live inside my mind, I am protecting them. They will feel grief, sadness, and confusion. But they will live on and I will eventually be forgotten. I will make sure they know how shitty of a person I really was inside. Now, some people disagree with me, say I am not shitty. They say I am human. Humans make mistakes, humans can be selfish, humans lie, humans act on emotions, humans think messed up things.If these things are true I have no desire to be human.

"do not get me wrong, suicide is not on my mind 24/7. I quite enjoy living, my life right now is more than I could ask for. No more emotionally abusive ""parents"".No more being shouted at. No more being told I am insane for the smallest things. No more being told that they are worried that every little thing I do will make me more depressed.But. When people get angry with me and shout at me. I relive the very pain I have spent my life trying to get away from. How much it made me feel like being dead was better than being shouted at. My childhood trauma makes me think suicide is the best answer when I am triggered. My trigger is when people shout at me. And when they make no sense. No sense as in. e.g Teacher shouting at me for a string being out. I do not understand why she felt the need to shout instead of asking to just put the string away.And how the her apology was so shitty. Because she backed up her shouting saying that she, can shout at whoever she wants. Because she is a teacher. And that asking why she was shouting is giving her attitude. And continuing to shout at me when I said I have trauma.I hate being confused. It makes me question myself, my worth, everything. The smaller me would always try to reason with me saying, that I am in the wrong. But with childhood of always being told I am in the wrong via shouting, guilt tripping, manipulation and sometimes physical abuse/fear. I hate it. So much that I would rather die.Other times. I am fine. I am content with living. I enjoy lighting the fire every night that warms up the people and the house.I enjoy learning new things. I enjoy hands on work and understanding how things work.I sometimes fear I will hang myself out of impulse. I am so vulnerable when I am triggered, that I will try to laugh, but I cannot and my chest will start suffocating me. I will forget to breathe. In almost a sorry attempt to die. I hate that my mind tells me to self destruct whenever something goes wrong. Whenever something goes wrong, I am more prone to impulsively attempting.",1

"I have dealt with depression and anxiety quite bad for the past few years (I am 18f) and as a result I feel like I am quite behind in life I guess. I left school early to do a beauty course which I enjoyed and thought I would like to go into that industry but towards the end of it I completely lost interest which negatively impacted my mental health, then I worked in a hair salon just as an assistant for 6 months and I finished there about a year and a half ago now and have not worked since. Since I finished the course I did, I have not been able to find any sort of career that interests me for longer than a few months which just really puts me in a rut by not being able to decide on something and formulate a plan to work toward. It also feels like I let myself down. I have pretty much been living life by myself since I finished school as I do not really have many hobbies or any friends to really talk to or hang out with, and as a result of this I never leave the comfort that is my room and its really hard for me to go out anywhere in public. One thing that I think would benefit me greatly would be getting a job but I just can never seem to keep any positive thoughts towards finding one, in the last two months I have applied to about 5 (which takes a lot of effort for me to do) and not heard back, but the day after I apply I end up having a major panic attack over it and hoping I do not get a call back because the thought of going to an interview is terrifying to me (and I am sure a lot of others). I have spoken to my mum about my worries and she is very supportive of me which I am very grateful for and she helped work on my resume for me and explained my skills and things to me but even with this support its still so hard to find something. I found a reception job which seems like an alright thing for me to do and I have written a cover letter for it but I have talked myself out of applying and can start to feel the negative thoughts tumbling around me already. Its hard to find something as I have very minimal experience and do not want to work more than 25 hours a week (I know I am picky). This might seem like a silly thing to be distressed about but its a topic that has been my biggest worry for a while and I would like to be making money so I can help with bills and be able to have money to spend for myself, I have things that motivate me to want a job but I just feel so stuck and like I cannot make myself take any steps to actually move forward. Its something that if I have not been keeping on top of supporting myself, I end up spiralling and having a breakdown over and getting very worked up about. I am not sure if any of that really makes sense of what I am trying to say but I am just so over feeling this way and being afraid of something so simple as applying for a job. I think its more what comes after I have applied like getting a phone call for an interview and then what questions Ill be asked at the interview and meeting new people, and then if I do get the job what if I mess it up or do not like it? I think that a part of me holds myself back because I am scared to be doing normal life things, I stay home pretty much everyday and do not really do much other than be in bed and read or watch tv, so its scary to think about going out and having something to do even if it is only a few days a week. My apologies for the long post but Id really appreciate any advice or something, even just if anyone has felt/feels anything similar. kind of a rant? I feel stuck and do not know how to move forward.",0

"I guess I should preface this by saying that talking does not work. I am too damned stubborn in my baseless negative thoughts, and I do not want to burden my mom by telling her about anything so she can get me to a therapist. With that out of the way, I guess Ill just list all my mistakes that have led me here.1.) I do well in school but not well enough to go to a good college. No good college, no good job, shame for the rest of my life while my older sister flourishes.2.) I fear I am going to end up like my deadbeat dad. Id rather die than leech off of others like he does.3.) I am just not a good person. I am a downer, I do not have anything useful to offer anyone, and I am entirely replaceable.4.) my grandma just died 2 days ago, and my grandpa probably is not too far behind. that is probably the only thing that is slightly out of my control, though I did not spend as much time as I should have with them.But I suppose I cannot complain. Many more people have suffered much worse and still loved life. I am just a useless coward. I am giving up. A hydrocodone overdose is looking really tempting right now.

She had depression and she did not handle it very well, she did not even try to make friends and she ended the friendships that she already had. She has not accepted any help from her family and eventually it was all on me, I was her only support without a lot of knowledge about the subject. It got harder when shetried to hurt herself, promised not to do it again but it happend again. I had to recruit for the army and came back home for a weekend every 2/3 weeks. Eventually I could not carry it all by myself anymore and broke up with her, one of the hardest things i had to do, I thought it would help her. do not want to go into more details but she took it very hard and it traumatized me at the time. Since then I tried to ""get back to the market"" with no success. I always got positive feedback from other people about my looks, my intelligence and my humor (do not take this post as an example), and I started believing it only not long ago. I decided to work on my confidence a few years ago and I really feel that I improved a lot. For 3 years since my breakup I have had so much disappointments. I tried dating apps, instagram, real life, match ups, but nothing worked. Almost every time it ended by lack of interest or in disappointment and me feeling like a total loser. Right now I am on vacation abroad so I decided to try tinder again. Got a match, we set a date, I got to her place... And she did not answer. Second time that happened to me and got many more stories like that. I am just so fed up with it I feel like I want to give up on meeting someone. I am so tired of expecting and then getting disappointed. I am starting to think maybe it is better to stop expecting so I will not feel like such a loser anymore. I am also tired of hearing people trying to cheer me up and saying it would eventually happen. Getting my hopes up and then getting crushed all over again.do not really know why I am writing here, just felt like sharing.Thanks if you read it all and sorry for bad english :/ Giving up on a relationship",0

"2:56 AMnot sure i belong here without a proper diagnosis, but it has occurred to me over the previous months of self reflection that the way my brain functions may be similar to those who proactively post in this community. I have worked the past 2 years under the shine of moonlight (12 hour shifts) and have contributed the sickness plaguing my mind to the lack of sunlight, activities. After further consideration and insight into this illness i cannot help but notice several similarities in my behavior that are commonly linked to depression. a small part of me wants to better myself, but another has the need for isolation, to pull itself away to become unknown. if life itself truly is a simulation i want out.Journal: the thoughts of disapproval, hate and unwant in those in our social bubble lead us to the only feasible answer. Isolation. But isolation only leads us to loneliness, a feeling too unbearable for myself to cope with. Isolation is the key and the cell. The plague drives us from who we think we know to trap us in a prison where within it lies in wait, it is only purpose to leech and degrade the only thing keeping it alive. 3:20 AM I am New",0
"I have been through hell and back just to be myself, lost my (extremely abusive) birth family in the process (who never accepted that they had a daughter instead of a son anyway), accidentally found out about a ton of memories from my childhood, and I just do not want to be in all this pain. I cannot work bc my stupid brain does not function properly, especially around other people, and I am running out of food. I started therapy, but idk how long it will take to get better and I am just hurting so much. I should not have to deal with all this pain just bc I was born in the wrong body and to the wrong family, it is just not fair. it does not feel like things will get better for me",1
"Due to something that has happened between us were not friends anymore. I will not go into any details, but he hurt me on levels that I did not think were possible. I trusted him. He knew all of my secrets, my strengths and weaknesses, my past, aspirations and goalsand according to him, I only knew 17% of him. I was always okay with that. Until today. We were so close. I am ready to overdose on painkillers now. Or stab myself with one of our kitchen knives. This is the last straw. I cannot do this anymore. The one person who I thought was my best friend hurt me so deeply that I probably will not be able to recover. He knows he hurt me, and he intended it. He knows I am suicidal, and it makes him happy. I am so disgusted and hurt and tired and angry, I just want to slit my throat open and die. He was the last thing keeping me here. And now were done. Lost my best friend today",1

Everyone around me can see how depressed I am. I cannot shake it. I honestly just hit rock bottom and I know this is it for me. I cannot even pretend to care anymore. I starve myself because I feel like I do not deserve to eat I am such a mistake. I have been getting drunk a lot to avoid getting back on drugs... My depression is BAD... so bad it scares the ppl around me. I think they know time is running up and the door is about to close forever. I have no friends. Which sucks when everyone tells me I am too attractive to not have friends.... whatever tf that means but I do not have friends and I honestly get so sick of everyone telling me I am too attractive to want to die... but guess what ?!?!I doI!!!!! I have no one. Not even my family. I have my mom but she does not understand my depression. I have my bf but he cannot always be here for me..... and I know my depression is too much for him at times but he just wants me happy. He deserves more then me.Idk how to express how I am feeling. I just feel dead inside and the thought of never having to wake up in this world again brings me so much joy....no matter what ppl say I will never feel good enough. I struggle with this EVERYDAY.

"I am starting to come to the realization that I am not going to amount to anything in this world. I have tried and tried my absolute best in at least attempting to accomplish something meaningful in my life but i just cannot. i have no idea what is supposed to make me happy, what exactly do i want with my life etc. i just keep drawing a blank. I have always been kind, respectful- hell even optimistic for the future, but life keeps deciding to fuck me up in ways and for things i do not understand and definitely do not deserve. phrases like ""good things happen to good people"" are complete bullshit to me now and i have a strong regret for ever believing that something as idiotic as that could ever be true. I am just lost and confused and have absolutely nobody to vent to or even someone to encourage me that everything's going to be okay. this is the worst state I have ever been in both mentally and physically.

I feel constantly in a dissociative state. I am going to go to the doctors tomorrow and try to get some help. I am also quitting porn because it is fucking me up big time. I want to be a photographer and a filmmaker, it is my dream. I just want to be a creative entity and I have a lot to say and ideas to share. My addictions are holding me back though big time and I need to overcome them if I am going to ever succeed. I would love to move abroad and try to get some work, hell I would take some locally, that would probably be my first bet. Although at the moment I need to continue working on my local presence and building up my portfolio. I need to invest in more gear, I am earning this money through working full time as well as selling any of my unwanted shit.

"I am 16 and this happened when i was 13. this girl invited me over to her house and we had already had sex several times before. i think she said to me that she did not feel like having sex but in my mind i saw it as an opportunity for sex because i was an asshole. when i came over to her house I layed on her bed and we began cuddling. i asked her ""hey want to have sex"" about 3 times in the span of an hour so i was being persistent. i was not using force or threats or anything. after the 3rd time she rejected me i then said to her ""I will go slow"" and she then responded with ""alright sure"". i was not sure if she was bothered or not I am not sure. she then layed down and i then went inside of her and it felt good, so i started to go faster and faster and she sounded like she was enjoying it. why was i starting to go faster? I am not sure honestly but my intent definitely was not bad I did not want to harm her. i guess i just started to go faster because of how good it felt and i was really horny. well anyways 15 seconds after the sex started she told me to stop and i did right away. as soon as i heard her say it i stopped it. she then said that she was sorry for ending it early and she said she was just worried about getting pregnant and I told her its fine. we then hung out for like 20 minutes and then i left. i feel like i will always be a bad person no matter what. i really wish i never met this girl so i would not of done what i did. a year after she told me that she had sex with 9 other guys and that those guys dicks were bigger than mine am i a rapist",0
"I am miserable. I have been in depression for many years and I do not ever see myself getting back to ""normal life"". I am 21 and from france, I live on an depression aid for now, I hate the idea of work because there is nothing I see myself work in for a living, the idea of working just repels me (and I have been searching since very young a work I would like to do, but nothing). I have a psychiatrist, I am on medication and tried so many different medication (still tries new ones from times to times) but I am at a point I really see no end in my depression. I have the two things I wished I had for a long time, which is money (from the depression aid) and a cat (who I love, but she kind of hates me for some reason). I already did 2 suicide attempts in 2017 and I wish I succeeded. I hurt from depression, some unlhealed trauma I do not know how to heal, some wounds more deep I still do not know what it is from, I hate everything about my body, my life. I live at my parent's because I cannot really afford an appart just from my aid, and even if I did I would probably let myself die of hunger as it is really difficult to make or even just grab something to eat sometimes. I hate my mother, she is toxic, she made clear she wished she never had me. I do not really like doing anything anymore. Medication is not helping anymore. I considered talking to a psychologist in addition of my psychiatrist and have even an appointment for August but I am hopeless and deep down I do not believe anything is going to help... Anyways, I am tired... I am just thinking about ways of ending my life I have not tried... I have nothing to live for",1
"I have been really struggling this past year with sadness. It started with a bad break up and not getting into the college I wanted. I know this shit sound super stupid and like a small deal but it has affected me really hard. I started going on week long benders of drinking to the point I spend hours recovering from the hangover. My relationship with family is a mess, my mom and I do not talk a lot and my dad has expressed his disappointment in me. My best friend has moved to another country and the ones that stayed are busy and I do not keep in touch with them as much as I would want to. I have tried reaching out to many people but I just do not feel comfortable disclosing my feelings to people I know. Man I know this shit has to end but I just feel so shitty every time a wake up and before I sleep.

I do potter around with the devil's lettuce now and then but it helps me sleep at night or get through the day when my mind is in an overdrive of thoughts of what I should be doing with my life, what my peers are doing, how successful they are compared to me etc. I work alongside my dad so that does not help in pushing me along really, every time I see an opportunity I do not go for it like I should do I just go to work, sulk all day, come home and smoke weed till I fall asleep, that is no life for a 22 yo but it is the way it is and I cannot seem to break the cycle, I do appreciate that I have a loving family etc I just want to make them proud and be happy for once in my life . Any advice is greatly appreciated. Lost",0
"I am tired man. I just do not feel like doing anything anymore. The only thing I actually look forward to is getting high. I am not interested in anything, and to be completely honest, *the very process of learning new things has become a burden to me*. The only thing that keeps me going is that by doing the bare minimum I am able to maintain a lifestyle where all I have to do is show up at work and do a ""good enough"" job and afterwards I can just get high and have a place to go home to. Everything is a burden. Learning how to socialize is a burden. Socializing is in fact the heaviest burden in my life. Everything I just said could be completely directed at simply learning how to socialize and that alone would be reason enough for me to be over and done with life.I am tired of trying to""become"" the ""best version of myself."" I am tired of having to greet people awkwardly over and over again just to get better at it. I am tired of trying to use body language or my own voice in a communicative manner.

I am tired of having to fight all of the automatic negative thoughts whenever I have to interact with another human being.I am never going to what I want out of life because of all this so why even live.

"Its like I am trash.. I have always tried to be nice and friendly to everyone in my life. Always moving aside and offering to help... now I sit here. Alone. No one to go to. And the people I thought were friends just kept me around because I was an easy punching bag. I grew up fat and poor and wore a hoodie all the time and never did anything fun... my parents would fight and fight and I just had to be quiet. Nobody likes me for who I am and I am sitting here typing this with a cat... I am so lonely. My parents could not care less that I left and that hurt the most. I could die today.. nobody would care, they would not even reach out when I was alive so what is new. Always the 3rd wheel.. always the last choice... always the option in relationships... it feels so horrible to not be wanted by anyone you know...

"I am 26 years old, have a full time job that pays well but I have moved back home to help save some money as well as assist my father as he gets older by also paying rent to assist financially without admitting that I am. My dad and his wife are happy with having me as I will be paying them rent and it means I get dinner each night and access to a car on weekends. However it comes with the consequence of my dad lecturing me about my future and reminding me of something I have already beaten myself up for; I am atrocious when it comes to saving.As per my recent diagnosis I have Major Depression, PTSD, Anxiety, and a Borderline Personality. I will admit it has been a challenge and overall rollercoaster of a time, when it is going good it is going great, and when it is not, well... Either way I have been massively impulsive with my spending since starting this job back in April as it is granted me a much larger paycheck, I even earn more than my father apparently as discovered in my most recent lecture this morning, whilst simultaneously inadvertently discovering my second oldest sister is still his favorite child because ""she is the only one who seems to get it right."" making me feel worse about my decisions and overall fearful for my future which I expressed as politely as possible to him. I also want to clarify that my father is not a bad person, he does care for me and does want to help, I honestly think he was just raised in a time where mental health was not a thing and he does not know how to deal with it and maybe it is even a little too late for him to learn, but he is a good person, he just can be a little... 'inconsiderate'. I find it hard to talk to him about anything for this reason, especially when his solution to happiness is to ""get out more"" or ""You need a good kick up the ass."" in a jovial but stern voice. I know lectures are sometimes a way people who struggle with expressing emotions show that they care or want to help, but it can be frustrating and demoralizing when he does despite trying my best to take it on the chin. At the end of the day I am an Adult and I made this decision on my own and am willing to accept the consequences that come with moving back home alongside the benefits. I do not mean to sound like an angsty teenage stereotype who hates their parents and I do not know what I wanted or planned to get out of posting this, maybe just someone to listen or know what is going on because I cannot really talk to anyone nowadays that is not paid to care. I love my dad, I remind him every day as I do with my brother and I wish I could with my estranged sisters... I just wish I guess that he could do the same without turning it into a lecture about my future which I have already overanalyzed a thousand times in my head.Peace, Love and Hugs to you all, and thanks for listening. I have moved back into my fathers place",0
"I do not know why I keep doing this and honestly I do not know why I came up this way, the only thing I can conclude is that I fell in despair so deeply? Let me explain or at least try to confess you why I do what I do, because even if you will think I am weird that is okay, because yknow, not everybody DESERVE good things in life. But you DO!I am sorry if you do not understand my way of expressing myself or my bad grammar or English, that is okay because I just cannot do anything right, but English is not my native language.I always felt odd and I feel I had to fake my entire life to seem more normal possible, so maybe that is why I am here after all.I always envied people who knows what they want in life, and had a normal childhood, I do not know why, but I cannot let go my past Ill probably never will.I consider myself nothing, so If I was nothing I could be anything right? But no.I tried so hard to fit in a normal life style, taking inspiration from the people I loved, I wanted to be as closest as possible to them! But, I was just lying to myself, and things only went downhill.My family does not care about me, at all, I do not blame them, after alla I think they would be more happy with me.I look outside my window and I see everyone begin so happy.I wanted to feel happiness but everything I felt was emptiness and so much self hate.I do not blame people who use drugs or use any substance, if I had money or way to do that, I would because i refuse to live in a world with myself, at least even for fews seconds, I would like to feel something else other than emptiness.Day passed, and I tried to be positive, my mental health deteriorated, so I started to give in in my self destructive habits.I fasted, because why not? I lived in a body i hated, i world that show me Beaty but made me despise myself even more.I fasted with just caffeine tea or coffee, if I got hungry I ate some fruit.All my days where spent watching the walls or hurting myself in some way or writing in my dairy all the shitty things happened in my daily life.This was until I fainted on the supermarket, my sister and mother were so fucking bothered by this, and i felt like shit because I cannot do anything right. But after that something changed in me.I though I was dead and I felt so...blessed?But, after waking up all I was thinking was how I can get closer to it.So I stared to planning all the bad thing I could do to myself.I was quite good at it, but when a car hit me, not to the point of hurting me that bad I realised that I did not wanted to die that way.I wanted, yeah, someone who could kill me.Its so strange to think that, but, I could not help that.When I sat on the edge on my window I always thought if someone would even bother to do something to me.Killing is not easy and most of the people would know that prison is waiting for them, but its so hard to not think about it.I realised that there is nothing more than I want than someone who wants me dead, at least who wants to feel that they want to do that to me, because I would feel so alone if they would feel forced.I do not know why I would feel so worth it in this persons arms.

"I feel like shit whenever I allow myself to feel anything. I have been alone my whole life, trusting people and feeling loved are several tiers above my current position on my hierarchy of needs, and they always have been, and I think they probably always will be. and yet, I do not want to die. but living is so hard, so much work, and it is obviously not worth it. my reward for a long day's work is coming home and feeling like shit, going to bed (probably after crying myself to sleep if I had any energy to spare after work) and another day of the same. nothing gets better, and I am too weak to fix or change anything, and too alone to get help. I know that eventually my will to live will be eroded completely, and I will finally kill myself. I do not know whether that will be weeks, months or (hopefully not) years. but eventually, I will either get my hands on an easier way to go (in which case I will probably kill myself as soon as possible) or I will grow a pair and off myself with a kitchen knife and a bottle of ibuprofen. I think if I had a single reason, just one, to go on, then I could make it work. just one close friend, one shred of hope or faith, one source of support (whatever the fuck that looks like) and I could rationalize the pain and square it away. maybe even get the strength to become the version of myself I desperately wish to be. But I do not think that will ever happen, and that is my fault. My sister told me the other day that I always seem cold and distant, that is why nobody likes being around me, nobody confides in me or allows me to confide in them. I am a piece of human debris from my parents' loveless marriage, flanked on all sides with valuable and good people, while I crumble under the slightest pressure. I learned to only be comfortable alone, to trust nobody, and that I am worthless. I do not know if I can find the strength to un-learn these things, or if it is even possible. I refuse to tolerate my current existence for much longer. Soon, I will either be dead or someone different, someone humanlike.

Normal posts have the opposite problem. Maybe a few comments but no upvotes. Oh well. I do not know maybe this post is stupid. I am probably wrong, I usually am. I just know that every time I come here, because I want to be with people that get it, I end up disappointed. And its ironic. Because this community is here so that we do not feel alone.

"(If this is posted in the wrong place delete or tell me to) I have had depression and C-PTSD for my whole life, just found out about this page.

"Hello there, I am 17 going off to college at the end of summer and just need some advice on what to do:)I have always been somewhat depressed and I have attempted at sophomore year of highschool(cops were called, etc.). However my parents reaction to it is something that I do not really understand. My father never talks about it, but my mom was the one who tried to make me feel better by telling me that others have it worse(people with no parents, money, limbs, etc.) and my reaction was ""over the line"". She even discovered my cutting scars and told me that I was crazy like a mental person. I even came out to her during this time but she rejected it completely, calling it gross and that I will grow out of the phase. Moving to rn,I try to do things I enjoy such as makeup, getting clothes, or hanging/talking to friends (stuff that I missed out on the first two years) I feel as though my parents want me to do things their way. One instance I was practicing doing heavy makeup since it is something I do not do often and my parents immediately started to discuss how I would be raped on campus and that I should not do time wasting things. Same things about my clothes, even though they are not revealing and I sometimes wear oversized clothes and big boots which they also openly do not like. This comes up many times, when I opened up to my dad about talking to a Muslim friend that I knew for two years and how he would ""ruin my life"" by raping me and I was not permitted to talk to him. It feels that my parents are pressuring me to live my life their way and it is taking me back to the dark place I was freshman and sophomore year. Any tips/advice on how to handle this situation would be heavily appreciated. Need help for confusing situation",0
I have just lost all my friends and i feel like i did a few months back. i thought i was getting better but i guess not. i do not know what to do anymore I am lonely again :(,0
"I have been sleeping excessively the past two days because its the closest I can get to death. I have never felt so close to committing before. As I wake up and doze off again I just plan out what I am going to say in my notes but I cannot even get up to write them. All the sharps in the house are gone now, so I was thinking of breaking the mirror in my room. But Ill probably pussy out. Just like last time. I wish I had the fucking guts to just get it over with. But Ill probably just go bad to bed lol. I cannot stand thinking. Being awake and having to think. do not even have the motivation to write my suicide notes",1
"i recovered from my eating disorder. i survived homelessness and living in a nursing home at age 24. i have 2 perfect children. i recovered mostly from my PTSD. I am in a paying band and still getting better as a musician. i have friends. i have other hobbies. I am still pushing myself to grow more.and i still want to fucking kill myself. i think about it every fucking day of my life, whether I am having a good day or bad, it does not matter, my brain will randomly throw it out there at least a few times. I have had 10 years of therapy, been hospitalized half a dozen times, been medicated and off meds. i cannot actually kill myself because my kids are young. but it sounds so nice. when i was a child i would comfort myself at night by imagining i did not exist and it still makes me sad i cannot just close my eyes and sleep and never wake up. i hate myself for being like this and i wish it would stop. it never stops. nothing stops it",1
I am only alive because of my sibling. They have already lost both parents to suicide. Its so selfish of me to want to end things too but I am so miserable and everything I try just makes things worse. I try things out of panic and it does not work then I just feel more hopeless. Tomorrow I am going to where my mother passed away to just think about things. I am not going to do it yet but its rough. I cannot take it much longer,1
I am probably going to kill myself after work tomorrow night. I plan on using the extra antidepressants I have to do it. Might even pick up some extra strength Tylenol tomorrow for good measure.

"I am m26yo and have always been financially and emotionally dependent on my partners. I always attract people because of my beauty, but I know I have a nice personality and a lot of interests, which ends up making people attached to me.I always had a war on my mind, and I never found the motivation to do things for myself. I never loved myself.A person said a few months ago that maybe I am like this as a survival mechanism, that deep down I do not want to change or be independent because it is easier and I save energy just by depending and relying on others.that is not fair. My boyfriend gets screwed every day at the hospital he works for and when he gets home, not even the dishes are washed. He has to worry about whether I am eating, about buying my food and my clothes and etc.If I can change? I have been trying every day. Therapist, drugs, etc. But maybe deep down, deep in my unconscious, there is this stuffed thing that does not want to change. And unfortunately I cannot fight it.I have everything in my power to be a successful person, but I am a lazy, selfish slug.Suicidal thoughts have always been with me. And every day I am more certain that this destination is very very close. I do not want to be strong. The only strength I want, is to finally surrender I take advantage of others. I suspect that deep down I just want an easy life. This is not living with dignity, and I am not strength enough to change.",1
"I have never felt worse. The first thing I did when I woke up was cry for what seemed like hours because I do not deserve to be fucking alive. I hate myself so much and I have been thinking about getting a car and driving off this steep mountain road and crashing into the ground. I am only 18. I just want to fucking be happy for once in my life but I have been struggling even as a kid. I think about finally lying in a coffin. I will not be anxious anymore, I will not be tired. Ill finally be gone. I am tempted to do it soon, the only thing keeping me here is the close ones around me, but I am losing them too. I should just leave since I have been nothing but a stressful disappointment to them. it will be best for them. I am so tired. I have been thinking and I am considering doing it.",1
"My brother has been struggling with suicidal thoughts since March of this year. Before confiding in me, he had been seeing a therapist and had not gotten any better. He was struggling to sleep at night so I slept with him every night for two months. I let him vent to me, he cried in my arms and Id wait for him to fall asleep before I did. Unfortunately I had to put my life on pause for all of this so that I can help him out as much as I can. After multiple failed suicide attempts, I decided to Baker Act him for three days until I found a facility that could house and treat him. While hospitalized, he was put on antidepressants and has continued taking them since then. After he was released from the hospital I had him stay in a treatment facility for about a month. He stopped sleeping there but he continued to go the facility every weekday for about six to eight hours. After receiving treatment from this place for a few months, he says he has not gotten any better. Since the start of all this he has become so heartless and cold towards me. He told me the only reason hes alive is because killing yourself is very difficult and hes failed every time. I begged him to promise me he will not try again and he says he cannot make that promise. I love him more than I can put into words, and every time I tell him that he does not say it back. I feel like I have tried everything I can. I am desperate. I do not know what to do. Apart of me feels like its time I take a step back because maybe I am being overbearing and I need to let him figure this out on his own. This has taken so much of a toll on me that I have had to seek therapy, as well. I do not know what more I can do to help him. My 19 year old brother is suicidal and I am desperate to help him.",0
"I am tired of living life everyday I have no motivation to do anything and lost all pleasure doing things I use to love. My whole life is fucked up. I graduated from college with a biology degree lived a shitty life after college were I was not getting paid shit, was in a toxic relationship and had a major weed addiction, which actually made me happy. I finally turned my life around a commissioned in the army which is where my life got even worse. I ended up meeting a girl and moving here to fort hood with her son to live in my new house. She fucked my entire life up and caused me to commit a felony involving prostitution. This has lead to me getting separated from the army. I lost all my friends, I am broke and in massive debt. I feel like I have nothing to live for anymore. I see no more value in life anymore. I let everyone I know down and most importantly fucked up the one opportunity to escape and be successful. I wish to die. I have though about it so many different times and think now is the time to go through with it. I wanted to raise a family but what is the point in bringing someone into this corrupt world. I have seeked mental health help and medication but its all bullshit. They really do not care about you at the end of the day and I am back to where I started if not worse. I just see know point in living anymore. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I feel trapped.

"Trigger warning anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughtsI have struggled with depression and anxiety all of my life. But a few months ago I did a 6 week group therapy course and I was feeling much better. I started slimming world, I started going to the gym, I just started enjoying life again. I have to have hormone injections every month to put me through menopause at age 29 and soon I will be having surgery to remove my final ovary because of endometriosis. The last 4 weeks or so I have felt absolutely amazing, I have had a positive outlook on life, I have been going out and doing things and actually having a life. Then I realized last week that I had missed my previous hormone injection, I do not know how long for. So last week I went to the doctors and had it done, and since then the darkness has been rolling in and slowly suffocating me. And now I am terrified that when I have my surgery I will be in this dark place constantly because I will be menopausal and because of my health issues I cannot take HRT. I have pain in my chest, I am constantly fighting panic attacks, I am not bathing or even changing my clothes some days. I am trying to eat right so that I can hold on to something that has made me happy but the urge to binge eat is constant. I am fighting it but it is just so hard.I have to walk my dog once a day and I am sat here paralyzed by anxiety, not wanting to leave the house. Like there is something pinning me in place. I want to cry all the time, I am picking fights with my husband over trivial things. I just feel like I am drowning.I want to speak to my doctor about changing my medications but I am too scared to pick up the phone. Plus even if I could I sleep 12 hours a night and I often miss the chance to even make an appointment.I have been suicidal in the past when the darkness takes over and I am not there yet but I am terrified it is just around the corner. I am struggling with my mental health and do not know what to do",0
"I am 20 years old (M) and have been having recurring nightmares for the past month that my gay best friend (34M) blew me while I was blackout drunk and passed out. I was slightly worried that it might not have been a dream, but thought there was no way he would ever do something like that.For some background: He had tried to stick his hands down my pants numerous times one night, doing it successfully once and fondling me. I did not talk to him for a year and told him when I got back in contact with him how much it messed me up, and that if he ever did anything like that again Id never speak to him. He promised me he would not.Today I was messaging him and told him that I got a new girlfriend, and he made a comment saying that he wishes he could have blown me again. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about, and he said nothing I guess... and we conversed a bit more and he said that he sucked my dick when we were both drunk.I genuinely thought it was just a vivid nightmare, but it was not. I feel violated, in shock, devastated, enraged, and a million other emotions I cannot begin to describe. I do not know how to deal with this. I have been depressed lately and going through a lot as it is, and this is another huge blow to my mental health.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I really do not know if I can wait but I do not want to go to the mental hospital again so what I am going to do is to wait till November or December. If depression does not leave me then I will commit. But if it does, oh well I do not want to think about that. The idea terrifies me. I swear I really do not want Depression to leave me. But all the things that I want to stay leave me one day, and so will depression, unfortunately. But I really, really do not want it to. Depression will leave me",0

I have had depression for about 15 years. Six years ago I was in hospital with severe depression and the aftermath of what I had consumed (bleach). My family found out about this then. I have been working through a lot since then with my family and their reaction in mind.I was sexually assaulted by a colleague two years ago (lightly putting it). I bumped into him at a pub two months ago and was hanging out (cos we had worked together for a few years after what happened). Later in the night I brought up what happened in the past. He attacked me and it was only broken up by a girl who he then started hitting because she was defending. She said we needed to tell the police because we were bruised. I have told them what has happened before now.Very much struggling right now. I am seeing a therapist but I would like some actual real life advice rather than supportive messages. My depression has reached its maximum. Researched and ready,1

The rest of the group did not last long.it is been almost a year since...I was already depressed at the time but idk... This constant feeling of loneliness? Not having any actual friends? I have tried making connections with people I sometimes meet online in games but even when I tried talking to create a connection it just never really happens... They either just do not care, or will not even remember me the next day or just ghost me anyway. I feel like at my age for someone like me at least I will not be able to find that connection with anyone ever again... I feel like I will not ever find anyone I can ever trust again...

"Ever just lay awake at night not being able to sleep, but you cannot bring yourself to do anything else so you just lay there in the dark, until eventually you pull out your phone and start swiping back and forth hoping for something interesting to magically appear Then you inevitably go back to just sitting in the dark and some how through all the odds finally fall asleep, but then you realize now that your comfortable in your deep sleep your inevitability going to have to wake up sooner rather than later In the end you wake up feeling like shit and think to yourself it might just have been better to stay up all night.

"Yea, well. Here it is. I look at my life up until this point and really dwell on how many things I have been keeping to myself in mystical awe as to how I even manage to do it without driving myself crazy.I feel weird laying in bed tonight. it is 3 AM and I have work at 7 AM. Promised my girlfriend I would work out with her at 4 PM. I hope that still works out considering it is a promise, and I have not worked out in years and am just now mustering up the courage. I want to preface that this post at times may feel it is losing its direction. Sorry about that, I am writing what comes to my head. As I was saying, I feel weird laying here tonight. My mind has a lot of thoughts going through it. Mainly the sense of confusion as to what is wrong with me. Right now I feel like there is a long line in front of me (figuratively). Each thing in line is a different emotion. I am the receptionist at the front of the line, and on most days I would deal with each emotion one at a time. These emotions do not ever seem to have a regular pattern. They can be constantly changing from feelings of sadness to intense anger (internalized), happiness (not too frequent with this one), anxiousness, melancholy, and (what I see the most) a dissatisfying meh that says everything feels fine today, I am still moving along to the extent I can and not thinking about my true inner troubles.BUT tonight, I am not dealing with the line. I am just letting it build up and having the front customer ring the bell over and over for my attention. I am looking at this line with a feeling of confusion and unfamiliarity as if I never dealt with it before. I have all of the emotions stacked up and I cannot seem to be able to process them. I feel everything but nothing at the same time, it is white overwhelming but not at the same time. It sucks it took that long to explain how I feel currently, and the silly part is that I do not feel satisfied from that explanation alone. I notice that for a while I have been unable to trust MY ability, the inky real primary source of myself, to tell someone how I am feeling. Because I am never sure myself. I am never familiar with how I am day today or will be tomorrow. Maybe I am just overthinking all of this or maybe I am not. How am I able to tell someone how I am feeling if I cannot understand or validate my initial thoughts. I know I will probably wake up tomorrow and look at this and brush it off as a bunch of rubbisH, then push it to the back of my head for it all to come back again. FYI I am writing this completely sober. Where will I find my zen? I know that sounds cheesy, but for real, when and how will I find my inner self-understanding. I look at like with different mindsets, and they switch up every day or week without my notice. I just recently got a screen for depression, and for one I did not answer some of the questions honestly because I was too nervous too. But also these questions were driving me crazy, I could not tell how to answer any of them. If I answered them a second time the day after, I would have given different answers. That day I walked out of the doctor's office feeling self-critical and angry about this. I wonder if my mindsets change too much. Maybe my personality is too malleable? I understand that people change, but my view of how I view myself and the environment around me changes a bit drastically sometimes.I obsess over dumb shit. Waist too much time revisiting and spending extended periods of time pondering on them. Lately, I have been very concerned by the possible idea that I may be bipolar or something. I feel so stupid for even typing that out, but that is the truth as to how I have been thinking. I probably am not, and I just overthink everything. But it roots from my desperate want to understand my emotions. Recently, I had a day (i do not remember why) where I felt very very very low and sad. I have not had this feeling in a long time. I physically felt slow. I mentally felt unable to comprehend the external environment. I felt too lost in my head. The world around me shut off, but I was still going on autopilot. I was so sad, I felt numb. This was a build-up to this low from the past couple of days before. I was having some really dark thoughts I do not want to talk about. But the next day I felt so up, to the point I had a euphoric feeling in my body for part of it. Now I feel like I am starting to level out again. That day admittedly, I had a really fun day doing activities, so maybe it was that. But what throws me off is how I went from SO SO LOw (like you have to take my work for it) to SO SO. high.I could go on more and more, but my fingers would fall off from the typing, and I am starting to get tired. I hope this post stays up. I guess all I am asking for is someone to listen. Even if you do not respond to this, thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling. I am sorry if this feels like a shit post, I do not expect everyone reading this to understand or relate, I just do not know how else to convey my accumulating thoughts. I want to just unplug the drain a bit somewhere and for now, this feels like it helps a bit. Venting is great. A drain that I never feel I have the time to unplug.",0

I feel completely destroyed that there is nothing at all out there to help me. I can barely do basic tasks or go to work, and I cry all the time, sometimes in public places.

I have been contemplating suicide for a while now. I have had many attempts but can never bring myself to do it. I do not think I want to die I just want the pain to stop I am so emotional and I drive people away with my bad energy my friends can only be around me for a certain amount of time before they start getting distant and angry with me my mom is worried I am worried why cannot I be the old me I just want someone who will listen anybody Why am I the way I am,1
"I used to have a lot of suicidal thoughts, especially around the age of 14, but it mostly came when I was drunk, I stopped drinking a long time ago, but lately the thoughts came back and maybe even stronger than beforethe worst thing is that I have no reason to be like this, I feel like I was just born fucked up, I do not have a mental illness, they have it so much worse than me, but I just cannot stop thinking about bleeding out, slowly and alonebut since I am a coward and a piece of shit that cannot commit to anything, I will not kill myself, I know that for sureor maybe I will actually be able to do it, it would be the first time I had actually done anything goodI think it is also worth noting that I hate myself and I cannot forgive the past me for who I was, fortunately I am now just pathetic and miserable increasing thoughts of killing myself",1
"Hi, I am 43 old, bipolar. I never had any goal in life, never was financially independent. i still live with mom. My professional experience is 2 years long. I spent most of my time feeling sorry for myself. I stopped my medication quite a few time and ended up in hospital with a long depression that would linger for years. Socially I never fit, I had occasional friends. I do not remember a time when I was really happy. That was my life before IT happened.A year ago strange things started to happen to me, I would have unusual mood swings. Moment of gratitude and dull moment all in one day. I never had that before usually it is period of euphoria followed by period of melancholia. Now it was happening all in one day. I became mystical, believing God was behind every aspect of my life, every small detail. There are moment I feel OK and there are moment I feel totally lost. I do not understand what is happening to me.I talked to my psychiatrist about it, he suggested an antidepressant. I do not want to take it because I believe somehow the grace of God is in me but I doubt and that is killing me. Has anyone felt this kaleidoscope of feelings trapped in a short period of time like he was a divine instrument. another zone",0

"I have been plagued by suicidal ideation for a long time. My father committed suicide when I was in high school, so I have been adamant about dismissing those thoughts, knowing firsthand how it affects survivors. it is been getting a lot worse the past year, though, and I am really starting to struggle and become concerned. This is despite the fact I am under the regular care of a psychiatrist and compliant with my medications. I am apparently a ""unicorn"" - a prolific non-responder. I have also had poor results with other approaches such as journaling, meditation, gratitude therapy, yoga, etc.I recognize that I have loving, supportive friends and family, but besides worrying about who will take care of my cat, the only thing keeping me going right now is the idea that those people would grieve...which is becoming less and less of a deterrent. I do not *want* to follow in my father's footsteps, but it is feeling more and more inevitable.I honestly cannot think how my life is valuable, which is scary. I cannot identify any particular talents, passions, or ambitions to work toward, and do not know what I can offer the world or leave as a legacy.Can anyone offer tips or experiences that helped you find value in your life? I am grasping at straws, so any input would be greatly appreciated.Thank you so much for taking the time to read my ramble and consider helping! Struggling to find value in my life",1
I am currently the most depressed I have ever been and super super suicidal. Long story short my mental health has just been steadily declining through the pandemic and I am at the point where I am trying desperately to get into some type of treatment facility. Getting evaluated by a psych on Monday. I also started Zoloft 5 weeks ago and am at the point where its only made me worse. But I am just trying to tough it out for a week or so more bc I know it could turn around and really do not want to have suffered through the past month for nothing. I am not going to hurt myself but I am so so suicidal and cannot stop thinking about killing myself because of how depressed I am. I know I am beginning to take steps but nothing can really be done that quickly and I just need these thoughts to quiet down a little in the mean time. I am just so fucking tired and really wish I could disappear. The only thing that makes it better is weed but that is relegated to the night time as I have temporarily moved back home and my family is keeping a close eye on me. I think they would judge if they saw me smoking in the afternoon. Its really really hard for me to do anything because I am so depressed so activity based remedies are difficult. I am basically at the point where I do not mind disassociating because everything feels so painful most of the time and it kind of numbs me. Please help. Tired,1

"Tried phrasing an intro but I suck at writing so ay, here it goes.Been depressed for about a decade I believe now. Had the occasional suicidal thought but it was not a major issue. It got significantly worse in May for no reason. I have just been trying to stay afloat by coping how I usually do. The future looks bright, people love you, you have this dream of being a musician, yada yada. Today something scary happened. I do not think I care anymore. I do not care I will never get to stand on a stage and I do not care that I did not have that date with the person I like yet. I do not care that this chapter of my life is about to end and that everything can and will change for the better.I do not even know how I will make it though the night. All the depression I went through up until now feels like nitpicking now. I cannot do anything. All I do is eat and drink. I do not even sleep anymore, I do not remember the last time I felt truly awake and alive.I am used to things being grim and just being this cynical, pessimistic person everyone hates to be around but this is new. I do not make jokes anymore, I do not play the piano anymore, I do not do anything. I am barely a person. I just get up, doomscroll reddit until my stomach tells me to eat, if I have anything there I will get drunk to make my presence a little more bearable and then I will cry for a couple of hours until my body is too exhausted to even do that and then I lay in bed in this catatonic state waiting for insomnia to leave me alone so I can,,,, do it all again tomorrow.I just do not want to be alone. The only time I feel alive is in groups. When I have to watch my every word and movement and I get to see different people interact. So much stimulation. So little focus on my own mind. Unfortunately I cannot be around people all the time. I do have a lot of friends but none of them would want to hear this. Sure, I am a funny person but also horribly disposable.Anyway, wish me luck at surviving this night, I am terrified of what I am going to do to myself hahaha It does not get better",1

"I cannot take it. I blame my mom for a lot at the moment and I just do not know if its justified or wrong or selfish or that I am right and I should have seen this a long time ago. My problems around a year ago were so trivial, so meaningliss. My problems now are unfixable. I blame my mom for them happening I cannot help it. Last year I started university. Within the first 3 weeks I realised the course was not for me. I told my mom hoping to get some support. Instead she texted my older brother who started saying I am stressing my mum out and that I have not given it a proper chance. He probably said some nice things as well but I cannot remember if he did. Those bits stuck out. I could have got my money back for the year and that ordeal would have been the end of it. I would have given university a go and I would have walked out feeling alright about myself, a bit of regret but alright. I had an okay first term, the second I just hated. Long story short the people I was meant to be living with next year were all scumbags. I did not want to go back in the third term and made that very clear. My mom probably cared but it did not matter, in her eyes I was being an idiot who was going to throw away another crappy opportunity. She screamed, cried and eventually I thought it would be better if I just went. Low and behold they were assholes and I came back. The third time I went back before I went I told her everything and she still thought I should go back. I decided to give it one more shot and it was the worst decision of my life. I got no help from the college. I now feel like a broken man. I resent my mom and brother, I feel like our relationship is truly broken. I do not want to be here anymore, I want to die I feel like if I leave home I will almost definitely kill myself as I have no qualifications and the best I will get is some studio apartment. I just want to die now. I truly for the first time in my life feel no fix. I am currently waiting for therapy but until then I thought it might do some good to get this on some page. *warning depressed rant bellow*",0
"19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; ""I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!"" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway ""like theirs"", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the ""Pimple King"" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because ""I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything"". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out ""what is the point?"" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please",0
The most lonely thing I have felt as an adult with depression. Trying to reach out to people especially to distract myself from intrusive thoughts about killing myself. No one ever reaches back out.

"Hey so idrk where to start but I am a 16 year old girl and recently have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety which all started when I began my accutane course. But it basically started when I went on the pill, rhat gave me acne, so I went on accutane instead. I have not felt happiness since about February this year. Its currently Mid July. I used to be beautiful before all these drugs fucked me up. I am super sensitive to medication and I was on erythromycin, accutane, prednisone (a steroid) and the pill. Now I am off everhthing and just on minocycline to control the acne. But accutane has left me with crazy side effects like extreme facial swelling and bloating I look so fucking ugly and people have been commented on it, calling me a catfish and looking at me like I am some disgusting piece of filth, the ugliest thing they have ever seen, shocked that I have had the biggest glow down ever. Anyways, I have had enough, I have been waiting for the depression to get better it has not, for my face to return to normal it has not abs I have no hope that my face ever will return to normal. So I am giving it another week, and if I am not better by then I am killing myself. I do have a wonderful life in terms of family and some close friends, but I cannot live with this depression any longer. I give up. Its weak I know. Ill probably just jump off a cliff or overdose (this one seems easier ). Does anyone want to give me some advice on ANYHING before I go, because I really think its over for me .

"About a month ago my best friend was laying on train tracks with a boy and got hit and died. Her funeral was one of the hardest days of my life. I still think about her every day but today I feel some extra grief and just cannot leave my bed. I have been doing better lately, I have a nice job and a perfect boyfriend that would do anything to help me. But I do not like telling him when I am down, because what is he going to do. He cannot drive yet so it is not like he can come to give me a hug. I would rather sleep all day until I can see him tomorrow. I asked him the other day if we could go to her grave and sit for a while, and he offered to buy me lunch after so we are doing that tomorrow. I have a lot of other thoughts floating in my mind that I cannot figure out which one is the root of my sadness. Maybe my past trauma? The fact that I am so impulsive I tell everyone things I do not want anyone to know. The fact that I feel like should not be allowed to go out and talk to people anymore. Even though it is definitely too late, everyone knows my darkest traumas. I feel so much guilt, so much grief, so much pain. But I will be fine tomorrow right? Like always, or is this the beginning of my next depressive episode. I even feel guilt in my relationship, if I have to lie to him or break his trust just to wish I could tell him everything and run into his arms. I feel safe with him, I could tell him If I wanted to and I probably will if he is not busy. I finally reached out to a psychiatrist and maybe I will get answers, but I am scared they are not the answers I wanted. Why is everything so hard, I am so young.. but for some reason, I still feel like my trauma is not enough. Lost my best friend",0

"Tldr: reccomending my favourite movie that I finally watched in the middle of my depression and suicidal tndancies. Now hear me out. But The Last Samurai. Loads of people rip on it for not being historically accurate in places and having a few Hollywood movie tropes. But when I came across this movie on TV and just watched it.. I was laying in bed all day everyday so upset with myself I was frustrated and wanting to cry but could never do it. It made me self harm out of frustration sometimes. But most of the time I was just numb laying down staring at the ceiling with the TV on in the back. As I was watching it I was relating to Tom cruises character more and more. (Suicidal and alcohol abusing man struggling with his past) It was the first thing that broke me out of constantly thinking in my head for months. Watching the movie. Seeing this man struggle and only end up doing the same thing over again hit home. Then getting captured broke the cycle, he started recovering from his alcoholism and started caring about things. Started caring for the child of the man he killed. He was finding a purpose. I always never understood people that say ""this book changed me"" ""this person snapped me out of it"" how can something just make you 180 on your feelings. But this movie started doing it for me. I was drawn in. Getting hope for this character and rooting for him. Then in the final battle scene, seeing this man that was broken, fighting for something he truly believed in. I am not ashamed to say I actually cried. I cried for about an hour. I was so happy that I was crying it made me cry more. Like I said before I always thought it was stupid or just a lie when people say stories or people just make them snap out of it. But this did it for me in a way. It was not overnight but it put the wheels in motion that there was hope. Its possible. I encourage you to watch it. It might not work. You might find it boring. Or you may be lucky like me and it snaps you out of your own mind and make you feel emotion again. Please keep trying it can get better. This movie helped me",1
so I never felt this low ever I feel numb unmotivated unable to do anything that makes me happy I feel nauseous all the time and so sick today was supposed to be fun I am on vacation but of course everything went wrong for me everyone looks so happy like their life is just so fucking perfect I wish I was one of them my parents will not let me go anywhere or even cry I feel trapped they deny that depression exists and say that its just sadness and it will go away I have tried to tell them that I need help and I am not okey that I am depressed but ofc they just laugh at me. They make suicide jokes and think its funny. I do not want to die I just want to feel happy again like when I was little. Everyone tells me its going to be ok but when ? I just want a hug from someone telling me that its going to be ok and that I do not have to cry and that I am not alone. I try to keep motivated and tell myself that its going to be ok and that it will pass and to just do good stuff to forget it but it never goes away:(. why am i still here?,1

"Men have it objectively worse in all aspects of life in the US except for sexual and domestic violence, and even then, the margin is closing rapidly. Feminist organizations are classifying female-on-male rape stats as separate from actual rape thereby skewing the statistics. It seems like no one gives a shit about men in this society. So if I kill myself, will I be reborn as a woman? Reborn as someone who is actually privileged in this society and yet still has people fighting for them? Will I? If I kill myself, will I be reborn as a woman?",1

I have tried all the study tools in the world yet nothing helps. My therapist's only idea is to do exposure therapy which seems to be her solution to practically all my issues, yet it is too draining for me. Does anyone have some advice on how to deal with this?

"... And I still want to die.do not get me wrong, life is great.. sometimes. It has its moments. But the past 7 months has been nothing but down hill...The love of my life was assaulted and raped, and she would not let me try to help her.. she stopped going to therapy, convinced herself that she did not deserve me, and five days ago she vanished. Nobody can find her... I have been absolutely worried and stressed out sick, literally. I have had to leave work multiple times due to throwing up from the stress.My dad got remarried not even a year after him and mom got divorced, and now I have three strangers living in his house with me. I feel like I have to be confined to my room to avoid them.. God, I fucking hate them so much. they are so loud and inconsiderate to me..All but two of my friends have left me due to trying to come to them with my problems, since I cannot afford therapy or my medications anymore. I have two weeks of meds left, and after that, I am going to have to figure out how to live without them. I am so scared, because these meds are the only thing holding me together anymore, even if it is just a band-aid fix.I have had a lot of what I thought were rock bottoms, only to have a deeper, rockier bottom underneath... So I guess whatever happens next was meant to be. I called the suicide hotline last night.",0
"Hi I am a 20yr M from Australia. This is my first time ever attempting something like this as I tend to have trouble talking about the things that go on inside of my head. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety from the age I was 12, though later on in life I have a few disorders that come along with that. The reason I am writing this is because I have been slowly getting really bad and it is getting to the point were I do not see myself making it much longer if I cannot change my ways. The problem there is it has been almost three years since my last job because of covid and well my inability to work because I honestly cannot face the real world because every time I do something happens that sends me back to thinking that if I work I will become suicidal again. I have no friends left and when I mean none I mean every weekend for three years I have spent on my own. I am worried about my mental state and what this is doing to me, my sleeping schedule is ruined I basically sleep during the days and am up all night do not eat enough food and do not really see the sun at all. I do not know what I am hoping to get out of this my expectations are not very high at all but if it did maybe someone who has been through similar situations older that can give advice or even people around my age like this. All I know is that I am scared of what I may do to myself and that I will not live past this lockdown in Australia. Anyway I am going to bed because its nearly 1 am because I did not sleep last night at all or today and I want to try and reset my sleeping pattern. I hope everyone is doing well and if you have not heard it lately I am insanely proud of you for trying your best. Depression overload",0
"I (20M) had this girlfriend for a little over a year. I voted her so much, and she loved me back. She was really the only person in my life to ever show me any kind of affection and love. it is not exaggerating to say she was the best thing that ever happened to me.But 3 months ago she had to move away. She decided it best to break up since there was really no way we could make long distance work. I knew it was probably the best option, but it still hurts.I thought I would be able to get over her, but I cannot. it is impossible for me to move on. She is all I can think about, day and night, 24 hours. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat. I have had multiple anxiety attacks, some extreme enough to where I vomited. I cannot function without her. I keep thinking about what she is doing at every minute in the day, and my brain cannot help but picture her with some other guy in the future. And honestly I physically cannot handle that coming true. That would be enough right now to push me over the edge.There is nothing I can do to distract myself. Nothing works. I am going crazy and I am scared it will never end. I do not know what to do anymore. I miss her so bad, it is killing me",1

I have struggled with depression for a long time. it is on and off like I am sure most of you are like. Anyways I just started a new job and feel great. My last job was extremely stressfull and toxic. I knew it was bad but I did not realize how bad until I left. Finished first week and feel soo much better. I know it is hard. But if you have a negative job or relationship or what ever try to change it. I try to be positive and that job was killing me. I was just comfortable there. It can and will get better. Comfort is sometimes a bad thing. Love you all Hey you all I have some motivation and positivity for you.,0
"I started a new job that I honestly did not think I had what it took to get and I am actually doing well but at the same time I have never felt more depressed than I do right now. I have a good job, a beautiful and amazing girlfriend who loves me and I am only 21 with everything to live for and hopes and dreams. All of this and I still want to end my life. My depression has always seemingly had a reason or host in my life for why it was happening and just transferred to another reason but now simply living day to day seems to be the reason and I am terrified. I have done therapy in college but sadly can no longer as I am not a student anymore. I cannot currently afford it enough to help myself. What should I do? I have started a new and exciting job in the field I love and have studied for and I still want to die",0

"I am literally crying so much right now - I have severe anxiety and depression about returning to the office and even just day to day all about my job. I am so completely unhappy with my job, manager &amp; team. They are not understanding of my anxiety in general and that normal job duties (customer service facing) are just so draining/take a lot for me to exert out. I have been going into the office a few times a wk bc of meetings and have to be in for the clients and I am having meltdowns before and during my time in the office. Yesterday I was so dizzy, shaking, and just threw up as soon as I arrived. Today I am crying so much because I have to go in tomorrow. All the while I am trying to fake it when I am office and getting so sick of people asking me how I am when I am not even ok at all. Or when they say its nice to me or ask if I like being back in because absolutely I do not. Since the pandemic I have WFH helping another team out and I have absolutely thrived. I am hoping to transfer but they do not have current roles open and unsure when that will happen. I am trying to last another yr until I move because I cannot financially afford to quit and/or look for another job bc in my city or does not have high paying roles for the most part and I am currently assisting my mom.

"I have complex ptsd and the reason I have stayed alive these years is to take care of my best friend, who is my dog. His liver is enlarged and we cannot afford chemo, but either way the specialists told us his condition is too poor for him to make an actual difference. Hes not eating anymore and keeps breathing hard. I had planned years ago that when its his time to go, Id grab the needle from the vet and use it on myself before he gets put to sleep, so we can both go. I did not expect him to get to this condition so fast... I assumed Id have 2-3 more years w him. Now I am lucky if I get 2-3 days w him. I just really needed to tell someone. I am scared. I do not think I even need a response. Just needed to write. My best friend and greatest tether to life is dying...confused if I should go too",1
"I was asked by a friend, ""why have you been so rude lately"" a few months ago. October 23, 2020. &amp;#x200B;At 12, midnight, I responded with, ""There really is not a straight answer to that question, If I told you, you would probably say I am faking it. I have this thing that feels like a disease, and it turns my positive switches off. It was not always like this though. I was nice, sometimes being too nice to the point I agree with everyone else's opinions no matter what it was. I thought when people were mean it meant they chose to be. But now that you ask I realize it might not be the only reason. I had little to no patience for anything. I lived in a constant state of anxiety and worry. When I engaged in conversation I felt like people found me annoying, and boring. I insulted them and a majority of the time gave them a passive-aggressive excuse for distancing myself from them. Thing is, I did not plan on being rude, it just happened. In the moment."" &amp;#x200B;Jesus Christ did not realize it was that long. Now that I am taking a good look at it I was right back then. I relate to that so much. Of course, I said it myself. I just thought I must have learned that from watching something, and applied it to myself because I related. But I tried to copy and paste it, but those are my words.I do not remember ever feeling so strongly. Maybe I blocked it out of my mind to distract myself. If so, good job me. It worked. But I found those messages again and it has me thinking. How do you stop being mean to people?Just now, not even like 30 mins ago I asked reddit ""what is the best excuse to get out of working with someone"" . I am alone.

"I suppose I have made an inch of progress since I have last felt the need to post here. My current job has been extraordinarily stressful for a long time. I have known for months, if not over a year, that I need to find somewhere else. Yet despite knowing that, I would get so scared about the thought of applying somewhere else, about having to go through the process of putting in that two weeks notice.So that was my situation. Too scared to hunker down and take care of the things that would make my current job better, yet too scared to push forward.My situation is not much different, but I have that inch of progress I have made in the past few weeks. I finally managed to get myself to apply to some other places. Only two so far, but maybe I can find some more. Or maybe I get lucky and I will hear back from one of these.Just going slow. I do not want to end up at a job that will make me feel the same, or potentially even worse, than I do now.I wish I was not going slow. I fantasize in my head that I will just hear back immediately from one of these jobs I have just applied to and I will be out of here. But these things take time, and as much as I wish it was not like this, I will probably need to apply to more than two places.I suppose I am not actively suicidal, but have been engaging in some reckless behavior. I do not really want to but after not putting in the effort to progress out of here I am tired and feel the need to cope in shitty ways.Just want out of here. Wish I would just quit. I have plenty saved but I just get concerned about having trouble getting a new job if I quit one out of the blue. that is my irrational brain, so concerned about keeping a job I would drive myself to an unintentional suicide, maybe intentional if it gets worse.Guess I got to just fight for that next inch of progress. Apply some more places and get the hell out of here. Change cannot come fast enough",1
Seriously it is wayyyy to long and unfair alot of animals have a decent a life span if it where up to me I would say 30 or 35 nothing higher.

"I will admit, I was once depressed a few years ago when I would been sadistically bullied into depression by some toxic people at my middle school who spread rumors. Toxically pestered me everyday during lunch (when my elementary school bff moved away). Also having a person physically shove me against locker room walls because they thought it was funny.I honestly do not feel depressed anymore. But that does not entirely stop me from contemplating on just the situation of a life I suppose we all are in, and being a lil glum about maybe how sad it all is.Like, there is always a feeling of melancholy after a fun day with friends and family. Because it is like, eventually you would not be able to just see them anymore out of whatever reasons life just puts forth. In what business of a circumstance or just state of living you would have to be in. Death perhaps? How much more time do I have with these human beings before they are gone? Years just pass by in a blink of an eye and your friends and lovers are all moving away, along their separate paths. you are just left to find new friends who will repeat the same process of leaving you behind in some form. (I am a high school rising Junior having recently moved to a different high school during the pandemic. And I have made friends.)And I suppose the amount of hard work you would be willing to put into a successful much of a future eventually dwindles down to the instance which people end up using you for your success. And do not exactly think of you outside of the image of which you have come to present yourself as successful. If you become successful enough, I suppose you become just an isolated image of success of which no one exactly can relate to, and just are intimidated by your presence, without really getting to know you.As for the other life's other non-human relationship fun stuff, I mean, being on this planet for some few &lt;= 80 years, these fun activities become repetitive and sort of just loose their meaning. I guess you have all done it before. Or will do it all some time. Why am I doing this? And why is this fun?And it is that all these fun and happy instances of which you are to be living are not exactly as long lasting as you might hope. That they all dwindle down to just the feeling of pain which leaves when all these feelings of joy just fade or die away as sadness takes hold. And it is that, perhaps pain is the natural state of which we are presented to live in. And it is as if we are just trapped in this sphere of a blue world. If you are a faithful person, maybe your faith gives you a meaning that you are supposed to accomplish a goal out of your life. But is not this goal a mode of which you are to be used by others?There are just too many instances to be sad as opposed to being happy. And it is just, do I want to continue living if all this sense of happiness is just a toxic reminder of the pain and sadness of the natural world when it is all over?tl-dr: the meaning of life does not feel very happy. but are not we just all waiting for death?...",1
"The fire burns inside your head,The words yell and makes you want to be dead,When they say we are our worst enemy that is true,Our heart knows what to say to deep scar you,The sea swirls during the worst of storms,Bees are busy but anger them and they swarm,Chaos and anger are easy to see,But depression and loneliness are hidden in me,I vent out in rhyme, words and even in games,But the lion roars inside me and needs to be tame,These bursts of words help me share my pain,My head hurts and heart hurts more than a sprain,I know there is light beyond my dark,I just patiently wait to see the spark,The moral here is we get lost through days and nights,But there will be that moment the sun comes at you bright,Darkness beware, be afraid because it is true,I have light and love from all my friends even you.

"No matter what I do I cannot maintain a decent sleep schedule. I want to be able to wake up early and sleep early and even though I can sometimes keep that schedule going for a few weeks at a time, I always end up staying up late one random day and ruining it for myself.

It gets annoying because I wake up feeling like the day is already over and I do not have time to get anything done.

Like intrusive thoughts.This gave me the biggest panic/anxiety ever that I have had since that day, so now we go back 2 weeks ago, my anxiety is so bad and I keep telling myself with intrusive thoughts I do not want to date, so I left her this time and I instantly regretted it so hard I got really fucked up emotionally, I begged for her back this time she said she liked being single and stuff but would try again.Since then I got into therapy, I tried improving myself for the relationship I paid all the money I had for online therapy, I got into IRL therapy I just had my session today and what we talked about was how much I love this girl and how to deal with intrusive thoughts.Now here we are 15 minutes ago she leaves me again, this time its final now I am just nothing, I am just laying here crying empty I do not know what to do or what to think I am just lost, scared and fucking sad. Not sure what to do or think anymore",0
"Hi, I am a 14 yo guy, I have a dad that is pretty depressing to say. Idk wtf is wrong w him but I think there is something wrong with his treatment in the past ~5 years. He verbally abuses me, my mom, and my sister ATLEAST twices a week. I have no one to talk to about it, this is my first time sharing my story. Sometimes he would even push my head to the kitchen wall for not opening a can. Disturbing: I once say him punching my mom till he vomit blood at the age of 7-8. If you say ""think of how much he have done for you"" I fr cannot think of any. I do not want to involve any law enforcement simply because i do not want my mom to be hurt more. I always think What if I just die everything will be reliefed. Domestic, verbal, physical abuse. I want to die",1
I cannot find a job. I am out of money. I am hungry. Idk what to do. there is a lot deeper going on but I am too tired to write it all out. Just venting I guess Kind of do not see another option?,1

I do not appreciate life and I am not grateful and a big fuck you to all you ""positivity only"" cunts who go around telling others to love life and be appreciative fuck you fuck you fuck you. I wish I could just die in my fucking sleep I do not want to live anymore but I also do not want to kill myself. Can I please just stop existing omg. I already know I am going to drag this on under I am fucking 80 years old alone and droopy and STILL be like this holy shit I need to jump down or get hit by a truck by like tomorrow I simply do not want to live anymore",0
"So me and ex GF of mine broke up recently, and I have not been handling it well. Been very depressed and anxious and upset all at the same time. Started abusing drugs and its not been a positive outcome. Well I made a stupid decision to I guess what you guys will call ""blackmail' and sent a letter along with some screenshots of our chats and a picture of us together to her family. Knowing her family is pretty religious I know this would hurt her. Well after all is set and done. the black lash that came with it. Well this stirred up alot of commotion. and Her brother called me and said the family is pressing charges etc. And read off some of the stuff their attorney told them. Me being super apologetic and trying to be diplomatic little late but. Anyways her brother was trying to reason with me cuz he gets me he was once my age and understands me. However what I did was very stupid I know. Anyways Me being only 23 starting my JR year of college this fall. Have alot going for me right now, well if this presses forward and they go through with this well Its GGs for me. Having this record will scar me for life, forcing me to drop out of college and figure out other means of surviving. Well the brother is tryng to be diplomatic here he did talk with my dad and said its not his decions its his dads since it was his daughter but he will try what he can. So my only two options. Firstly we resolve it diplomatically idk if its money or what they want but I am praying we are able to work this out and come to a resolution. Or 2ndly priosn not being a option for me, well there is only one way out of this and that is the cowards way out. If option 2 does end up being the way, well I have already liquidated enough cash and will enjoy my last days and go live life and do everything i wanted to do and travel the country and enjoy life for its final moments and just end it. its alot on my plate I know I fucked up in a way should have not done that. But idk prison is not a option for me. So I am praying this will work out with a positive outcome. I don think there is anything else I can do at this point but just wait it out until I hear back from the brother on what the next move is. Confused, depressed and just do not know how to handle the situation",1
"Hi everyone. I am an 18 year old Male, and I have been depressed ever for about 5 years. For the longest time, I have been captive to suffering in silence. But I cannot keep it in anymore. I need help, and I am fucking terrified to admit it. My depression has been getting steadily worse for a year. I have been close to ending it all many times, I feel like I am drowning, but every day I put on my smile and act like nothing is going on.I cannot keep doing this. But I do not know how to tell my family how I feel. I hardly know how to talk to anyone anymore. I could really use some advice from those of you who have been in my shoes, talked to someone, and got help. Thank you all in advance. I am considering opening up to my family, I need pointers.",0

"I have lot of problems with mental illness, and I have been through a lot of trauma. The work it would take to function like a normal person, and the fact that I would have to manage my symptoms for the rest of my life, is just too monumental a task for me. And life overall seems miserable anyway, so why bother getting better? Nobody's ever been able to convince me that it is worth the time and effort or that I am worth anything at all. And so I have realized that that is the core problem. If someone could give me real reasons to get better maybe I would be willing to try again. And I am curious as to what those reasons would be, so I am thinking maybe I will try to call a hotline or something and see what they say if I even manage to get an operator on the line. But I am pretty confident in my reasoning skills, if nothing else, and I doubt that anyone is going to say anything I have not already heard before. Nobody has managed to convince me",1
"Pretending to the world like I do not have a problem.Mental health service at work = message a therapist that might answer in 24 hours and then when you get an appointment it is only 15 minutes and they just tell you a breathing exercise.Have tried working on personal projects, doing extra online training for work, and even fuck off and play video games, but I do not care.that is really it.

"Summary: I felt great but then I called the cops on my friend for sexual assault (some nsfw) which they took extremely seriously and I do not want to go to court. Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet, there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her, I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke, I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared, I cannot go to court, I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record, not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though, my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago, like really happy and confident, I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy, like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court. I want to live and I want to be happy but I am so scared and do not think I can do it I really need help right now because everything is going wrong",0
"As I type all this out, I am certain that the final chapter to my story is coming to a close. I am so lost. So empty. So bewildered. I do not even know what I am feeling right now, let alone who I even am. I can barely formulate words to describe to you how mentally fucked I am. that is why it is taken me over 7 draft's and 4 month's to type this post out. I want to apologize in advance if I am all over the place here.I really miss being a kid. I was a charming fellow who oozed optimism. Everywhere I went, I radiated positivity. Perhaps you could mistake this for innocence? Regardless though, everything was so different then. The only thing that mattered to me was catching the latest episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Never in a million years would I have expected to grow up and be worth less than the ground beneath your feet. Here I am at 21 and I have become, nothing. I do not have a car, I just got a job (and I probably will not keep it for much longer), I have no one to love or appreciate me, the little amount of ""friend's"" I have are slowly pushing me out of their lives, my credit is fucked. The only thing I have is Music. But even still, it can only go so far. Drowning out my thoughts in tune is great and all but eventually, I will be brought back to reality and my little fantasy will vanish.It does not help that I still live with my emotionally abusive, narcissistic mother. what is worse is that, realistically, she is the only remaining person in my life and because of this, I am forced to love her. But loving her fucking hurts. It feel's as if I am walking on egg she will's when I am around her. She constantly gaslight's and manipulate the fuck out of me to the point where now she has complete control over my life and emotions. Not only is everything my fault but she convinces me that I have said thing's to her and I cannot recall me ever doing so. If I try to strike up a conversation, she pays little to no attention to what I am saying what so ever, and then scolds me for not talking to her. She always calls me inadequate and weak. Whenever I mention a promise she made to me, or something hurtful she is said to me in the past, she acts like she has no idea what I am referring to and say's, ""...that does not even sound like me. I would never say anything like that to you..."". Everything she says to me leaves me questioning my past and rationality. Maybe I am a weak, lesser-human ass pussy that overreacts and exaggerates? As fucked as it sounds, at times I wish she would just bawl her hands up into a fist and let out all her frustration and anger onto me. But she does not. So instead, I take a blade to my arm and ""brand"" words onto it.it is incredibly difficult for me to describe my emotion's. it is almost as if my brain is like the physical manifestation of White Noise. Most of the time I feel so dissociative, my entire being is on auto-pilot and I do not really ""snap out of it"" until I am in stressful situations. But by then, anxiety ensues and I start trembling. Like now for example.Suicide has been the hand tugging at my shirt for as long as I can remember, as far back as my youth. I even attempted twice this year, and unfortunately I am still here to tell the tale. I know a lot of people attempt because they want for their pain to end. For me, it is a bit different. My pain will not end. As long as my heart beat's, I will forever remain this way. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. These thought's will never stop. I will never not be depressed and miserable. it is been almost a decade since I have been this way, and it will never end. I have tried almost everything: therapy, meditation, religion, hotlines, support groups. Nothing. Next time, I want to ensure my method will work. I do not want to survive and end up in a vegetated state or losing half of my face or what have you. Last month, I watched as my childhood friend was buried 6 feet under. He shot himself. Well, I take that back. I did not attend the funeral. My mom guilt tripped me out of doing so. Imagine what kind of shit friend I am. Pathetic. No wonder everyone is pushing me away.I have no idea what to expect when I post all this but...it is really late. I am not making any sense right now. If you managed to read through this bible's worth of text and hear me rambling and being a bitch, thanks I guess. Maybe someone might give a fuck. I have a treat for you. it is the only gift I can give this world: half decent taste in music. Listen to ""A Different Age by Current Joys"", the whole album. it is been on repeat as I have typed out all this bullshit. If you are as low as me, maybe this album will speak to you as it is done to me. me rambling a bunch about my life being so cruel.",1
"When I go, I will not say goodbye. Life is so hard. Why did you make me believe I meant the world to you and then say you are sorry, you lied.

When I go, I will not say goodbye. you will read about me, that is when you will find out.. but you will not get to say goodbye because it will be too late..

"Sorry I do not know if this qualifies as request personal support but please let me know if anything is wrong. I have had severe acne for the last 2 (almost 3) years now. By this I mean I had large, inflamed blind pimples over my face. It just started when I was 14 and got worse and worse. I looked absolutely disgusting and the pain was even worse than the looks people gave me. I went from doctor to doctor but all they did was give me generic medication that did nothing. I eventually went to a dermatologist and all he did was inject my face with this stuff that was supposed to help but it just made it hurt more. I had these medications which were supposed to be strong but just made me extremely depressed, more than I already was. The cherry on top is I moved into homeschooling and the people I thought were my friends just never messaged me to ask where I was or what happened. Idk maybe its selfish of me to think that. My acne has gotten a lot better recently however I still have scarring and I occasionally will get the large ones. I owe all of my recent progress to my amazing mother who has helped me through everything we have faced. I wish I did not have to feel so irritated by my face because I feel bad for being so negative around such an incredible person. Anyways I have rambled on for too long. I know my story is not nearly as bad as the things that I have seen on here but I just wanted to express my feelings. Thank you to anyone who has read this, I wish you all the best in your life. Just wanted to get this off my chest",0
"I know I am not ok. Yet I cannot help but wonder now with the media constantly telling us that depression is real and is crippling so many people out there, its becoming this massive self fulfilling prophecy for the whole of society. I show just an ounce of self pity and self deprecation and I can instantly feel the compassion and pity and sympathy from the other person. It feels weird. I feel like I use it as a tool of manipulation for times when I know I could have done better. For times when I know I did not step up and pull my weight. Yet I feel so dead on the inside I have no motivation to even tidy my flat or feel the need to achieve anything ever f*king again. I feel too far gone as if I can never ever be truly happy again. I wish I did not grow up with social media and unrealistic expectations. I feel like my mind has been poisoned and there is no antidote that can fix it. The path to healing seems so overwhelming and long I just cannot be f*kd. The road to inner peace and happiness seems impossible. I do not feel the need to be better anymore. I cannot be bothered with my appearance, my career, friends or dating life. I am just waiting to die. I do not want to tell the few close friends that I have how I am truly feeling. I do not want to bring them down or have them worry. I do not want their pity. I do not want to tell my family. At the end of the day its up to me whether I want to improve my life or not. I just feel so dead on the inside. I am not ok. do not know what to do. But is depression even real tho",0
"I been through a lot of changes lately, I just quit ""the perfect job"" with a really toxic boss. I could not even talk to her bc she wanted all written in case that she needed to prove that I was the one that did something wrong. I ended my long distance relationship 3 months ago, he was a completely different person when he returned to the us. We are still in the meddle if the pandemic here in mexico. I am super scared of not having anything right now.... I still feel is for the best this changes but I am so depressed that I do not have a partner to rely on or work right now.... it is been so hard to change",0
"I keep finding myself in situations where people end up hating me. No one really wants to be around me anymore and for the past 17 years i could never figure out why. Maybe it was my physical appearance, but even in online communities everyone eventually ends up just yelling at me, so maybe it is something I say. I have always known that I have trouble understanding ""social ques"" (i put it in quotes because i really do not understand what they are), and I know there are some people who take offence to things pretty easily, but they also champion say whatever you want and do not be afraid to talk, but when i say something they get mad but when they say something that hurts me i can either not speak up or if i do, they just yell at me some more. There are probably some that say ""DW there are nice people in the world"", and there are, I acknowledge that. But almost everyone who is at least decent in my irl world is too busy to deal with my problems. I always ask them to do stuff, anything, but they are too busy to even respond sometimes. I have always believed that being nice will get you places in life, and it does, and those nice people do not have time for me. I just want to find something to do on my own but i suck at everything so its hard to find passion :( I am alone and there is nothing more to be done",1
"And I lost my favorite tie clip. Afterwards I went to a barbershop numb, alone, did not think much. And got the shortest hair I have had in years. The new look is shit, I miss my middle part from before. I feel like all the life journey I have been on and will have is just a gradual process of losing and becoming more immune to pain. I have had a few attempts in the past but somehow I still want to hold on to it and see, maybe one day, just one day in a few decades life would be different and I can be genuinely happy. I really hope I can make it. I attended my moms wedding today. I know she does not even like the groom because she told me before.",1

If only they knew they are part of what is driving my mentality low when they cannot gawd damn understand me. I guess I cannot entirely blame then though since we are all individuals with different thoughts &amp; personalities. it is just not the same when I was young. I do not enjoy reading, writing, doing art, watching movies/shows, going out as much as I use to. Therapy do not even cut it either. Those fucking therapists just take your $ &amp; ask all the same bullshit questions to dismiss you in the end when they have had enough. Life suckz Relapsed",0

I have been extremely sad and disappointed in life for months and its never been this bad. When I was a freshman I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and even then it has never been as this bad. Never. I have never struggled this much. Nothing even triggered it. I just do not understand it. I am deeply sad and so unsatisfied with life rn. I have been thinking of suicide for a while but I have stayed alive bc i keep thinking and hoping it will get better. I have never struggled this much but oh my god it is not getting better. Please tell me you understand,1

"Back when i still had a couple of friends left we used to hang out and have fun i sometimes had moments where i felt my depression creeping up on me and just become numb and depressed af for minutes and sometimes hours and what they used to say was I am like a ticking time bomb that i would stop being fun and become a joy kill.Nowadays my depression has gotten worse and i do not leave my room and bed for hours and hours just staring at the ceiling and listening to sad music my parents just say that I am not depressed and I am perfectly fine and that I am just a lazy attention seeking disappointment of a son.When i actually get out of the house its to go to random meaningless party to get drunk and high and have meaningless sex just to try and fill the emptiness that i feel inside meIm 16 and with with all the horrible shit I have done and seen in my life i have even become desensitized to the idea of death and sometimes i would just cross a road with cars coming at me fast to see if i survive or die.The worst part of everything is that i have hurt the only person that i still care about, I have hurt my bestfriend to the point where he does not want to be friends anymore and i know that i should not have slept with the girl he had a crush on especially knowing that i ruined any chance he had with her while knowing that he could have had a chance with her.I feel like a dick and an asshole for fucking up the only good part of my life which was my friendship with him.Tbh i do not even know the point in making this post knowing only 3 people will ever see and read this Depressed and lost",0
"Fresh from looking at at a thread that was on the front page of the body of a women who committed suicide in a bathtub full of water.

The picture, implications, thoughts and comments have screwed with my state of mind, but has not become a deterrent. Just ended up causing a current breakdown, particularly after seeing other posts that hit off other triggers.I might be selfish for wishing others did not go through crap, but guess this world just has to suck for too many people.

"there is a old arabic saying that goes like this: ""You want to kill yourself? Throw yourself into the sea and watch yourself fight for survival. You do not want to kill yourself, you want to kill something within you.""I have been suicidal and depressed on the latter part of my teenage years. Even now i feel depressed from time to time, we all do i think. But i want to flip the common thought of depression on its head, just to look at it from another perspective. I am not denying that suicidal thoughts and depression has neurological base but I am not going to talk about brain structure and all that stuff. I think you can deal with depression here and now. People who are depressed and want to commit suicide are the ones that might love life too much. The universe is flowing through them at the speed so fast that they cannot handle. They are too full of ocean of life and have too much feels. What they really are seeking for when they want to commit suicide is to return home, to the source, to rejoice with the vast ocean that is life. They very much want to live and they want to live authentically. What they really want to kill is the ego, which fabricates the story of their life which they now realize is bizarrely illusionary. The idea one has to end ones life is actually a point of awakening. They want to wake up and they want to reach the bridge of life and get to the otherside, which could also mean death. Death feels very certain and very real. Life on the otherhand intangible and uncertain, it is always moving. I think this is why many people have had experiences of awakening right after coming out of the darkest hours. Now when i feel sadness and negative emotions, i look them as an opportunity and an invitation to change the current narrative of my life that is not working out for me, or to delete it completely. I try to face my emotions head on, rather than suppress them, by metitation. I sit, eyes closed, hold my thoughts and emotions like a baby. Bathe yourself in your emotions. Listen to them. Listen to the underlying intelligence beneath the sadness because it is there for a reason. it is there to try to communicate something. It has to be heard. do not fight it. Witness it, be friends with it, laugh with it. Beacuse ultimately they are part of life and part of nature and part of you.

"I honestly do not know what to do anymore. I joined the Army back last year and shipped out for basic last month. I was pretty happy at the time since I just graduated HS and was making my parents proud following in their footsteps. Now not even 2 months in, I am back home on con leave for a hip and knee injury and I just do not think I can mentally handle going back to Georgia. I have lost all my motivation. It just sucked being there in Red Phase. Sleep deprived, Hungry, Constantly getting screamed at/smoked for minor mistakes. does not sound like much but when you combine it all together, it sucks. I tried to power through but got injured the last week of Red Phase. Now I am getting recycled and being placed with a platoon freshly starting. I am honestly contemplating suicide. I am just sick of living at this point. I doubt things will get better for me. Joined the Army and feel Suicidal.",0

This is hard. Fuck this",0
"I cannot find any motivation to finish my schoolwork. I have \~130 assignments to finish before September 18th (roughly five of which are book reports on novels), and am having the same issue I have had for years. cannot be bothered to do it. I have absolutely zero delayed gratification.The impending doom of this deadline is absolutely killing me. they have switched my Anti-depressants three times. None has worked. I have tried everything I have been recommended for motivation. I cannot even have a conversation with my Mom without ""how is school coming along?"". The other day, she said ""What, is me going to jail over you not finishing schoolwork not motivation enough?"". I do not believe she understands my inability to feel motivated. What pains me the most is the fact that I know it is all my fault. I would not be in this position if just a year ago I decided to do half an assignment a day. This is the fourth school year in a row I have found my self in this position. The same feeling. The same isolating myself in my room whilst trying to run from all my mistakes. I am just straight up not having a good time, man. Lack of Motivation is seriously bad at the moment.",0
"Hey everyone, I am a 25 year old with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering, currently working for the government and living with my mom. I feel like I can no longer recognize myself now, in comparison to 3 years ago, when I was in university. I used to be confident, good with women, played a bunch of sports, partied and graduated with Honors. After university, I could not find a job until about 8 months of coming back home and living with my mom. During that time, naturally, I did not feel good about being unemployed. However, I eventually got hired by the Public Works department in a managerial position as an Engineer. The plan was to live with my mom, save most of my money and then go off to do my Master's.During this time I have gained 25 lbs, I hardly go out (even worse due to the pandemic), no relationship (except for 1 fling, 2 years ago) and I do not have the drive to do anything. I guess I became complacent with my situation. I just go to work and come home; rinse and repeat.The pandemic definitely messed up my plans to do my Master's Degree, but I think I am lowkey using it as an excuse, because I am afraid to fail. This idea of failure is also very prominent since I finished my Bachelor's. I am even afraid to play video games competitively, because I am afraid I will be outdone by my friends. When it comes to private Engineering jobs, I am also very anxious because I think I will make a mistake. I have given up 3 private jobs already, with the 3rd happening today and I feel extremely shitty about it, because I felt it was my chance at redemption. I feel as if I am giving up all my chances of making a name for myself and I am watching life pass me by. I cannot recall a time I have actually had a good time, since I finished University. I am not happy with my appearance due to my weight gain, which contributes to me not wanting to go out. Then staying home just kills my drive to do anything productive. I know it sounds like an easy fix; just lose weight and do this and that and get your life back on track, but I just do not feel motivated. I do not know how to get my drive back. I am not sure if I am depressed, but I definitely feel like shit.",0

I neglect to take care of myself but I also could just be a lazy piece of shit. I do not know, I am just anxious about the dentists usual speech of you need to take better care of your teeth I had a pretty consistent schedule for a few months but fell off after a lot of stress and depression.

And I am smart enough not to attempt anything why in hospital.I am just so tired, and I do not feel anything. People go about their lives like that forever.

"Just wanted to share my experience here. I was not getting much better with SSRIS or bupropion. In the last three years I have tried different options but I never truly felt any major difference.I have changed analysts, and my new one suggested trying lamotrigine. First time I have had more than two weeks of ""normality"" in years. I am only one month in, and the difference is huge.I read many of the posts in this sub and recognize many thoughts as my own... And then realize I have not had them in a while. that is how I tell lamotrigine is really helping me.This is only one experience, and it does not mean this drug would help everyone. But, from one person who tried a lot of options to another one, keep on trying. I did not believe I could be at peace, and suddenly, I am. Lamotrigine is really helping me",0
"I am curious if anyone here has experienced a ""fall from grace"" (apologies if this is not the most correct term) specifically you became the best (or highly skilled) at something in your life, but due to whatever circumstance, you are now no longer able to do that thing.A couple examples as it relates to me would be Michael Phelps or Dominique Dawes, olympic athletes who competed at an extremely high level, and basically devoted their entire lives to becoming the best at their chosen thing (or happened to become the best through their drive/passionate). Both of them are no longer able to compete at those levels anymore, and have stated in interviews that they suffer(ed) from deep depression for a multitude of reasons. What I gather one of the largest reasons is, is that they wrapped their entire identities around what they did, yet now that they lead more of a normal (possibly even mundane) life, there is a lost sense of self, and potentially nothing else could ever compare to their accomplishments / life long love / pursuits. I am asking this, as I have lived this life (non-olympic), and have felt the same way as the both of them for many years. The problem is that I have not met anyone else personally who is experienced this (which is why I am asking), and it is just as isolating as the quote ""it is lonely at the top"". What I specifically struggle with now (for many years), is once you have experienced a joy, fulfillment, and/or accomplishment on such a high level, the pursuit of any other endeavor seems almost meaningless. Of course one could hope to strike lightning twice, yet your ""first love"" (ie. the thing that you did), seems to always outweigh what anything else *could* be (at least for me). there is also a potential guilt I subconsciously feel about *truly* choosing to move on to something else. As a side note, I have done deep work with a Therapist regarding this, which has been beneficial to a degree. I appreciate anyone for taking the time to read this, and/or lending your own thoughts and experiences. Thank you. Fall from grace",0

"I want to be prescribed a med that will take the edge off and make me less nervous and anxious, and will also take depression away. Simultaneously, I also want to take something that will make it harder to laugh. One thing I always do frequently is laugh when I am bored or want to feel happy. But since I live up under my parents, one of my parents are starting to feel like my laughter is annoying. It is not uncontrollable laughter, but it is noticed by one of them and they feel my wanting to laugh is annoying. I want to tell the doctor that I laugh without him thinking I am manic.. I do not want him to send me to some other thing I have to pay for because he thinks it is manic laughter. But I do want to be able to convince him that I need an anti depressent/anti anxiety med that will make laughing something that is harder to do. What should I tell the doctor?",0
"Greetings everyone. I do hope you are having a good day/night. I have come here to post my final message, thank you to all who will read it and please hold on tight to your life. I have seen many things throughout my life. I lost my father and several other family members early on. My mother was beaten and spit at by my father and grandmother when she was pregnant with me. That is all I will mention here abuse wise. I grew up alone without any supporting figures. I have survived a war in my country, although it lasted only a few months, it was still not a pleasant experience. I was used by people I thought were friends and I was in three toxic relationships. I have tried ending it dozens of times but I just could not do it. Now that I finally have nothing, actually nothing, only confusion and pain, I do believe I can do it today. I used to be a happy optimistic kid and now it is a shame to see myself as corpse (mentally) I wish I made the right decisions and did not traumatise myself even further. I regret what I have done, mental instability was never an excuse to harm or plot against others, neither can it ever be an excuse to hurt animals. Please please please get therapy as soon as you feel something is wrong, I did not do that and it was the biggest mistake I can think of. Please hold on everyone and do your best to work with what life has given you. I wish for others to not end up like I did, I wish for others to be at least somewhat happy. Farewell people, I do not know any of you but the only thing I hope for is that you do not go through what I have. That your heart does not die, that your hope does not die. And I assure everyone that someone out there cares. The decision is mine, I have already been considering it for a long time. I know I could have kept going and achieved something. But with the near insane state my head is in, to keep going would only be torture. Today is the day",1

I wanted to be ok so that I would be able to enjoy my time with him and just be happy with him, but now that hes gone I feel like I have nothing to fight for. I feel numb, and I have realized parts of me have been trying to convince myself it was a toxic relationship so that I would be able to just feel something. But I cannot. And the worst is that we did not even end on a bad note. We made out and even said the first I love you to each other before finally making this decision that seemed as if we had been delaying. I feel so guilty and upset and I have no idea what to do. I have put all these walls up and have been suppressing my emotions so I do not know what I truly feel or what I just think I feel.

I see all the hype about manifesting things and experiences for oneself and I thought I would be interesting to manifest death. Now I have 0 experience with manifestation but if it works for other things why would not it work for dying too? It would be perfect especially if you got to die the way you choose to. Well just a random thought as I am one those people who want their death to look like an accident but all the options are too gruesome or likely to fail and end up in some vegetative state.I do not know if people who manifest things are suicidal but it would be interesting to find out. Can you manifest death?,1

I feel like I am trying to crawl out of my skin.I have been taking 100mg seroquel for four days. I am in a weird situation right now and its really difficult to explain but I am going to try. My dad met someone on minecraft about ten years ago and long story short, they hit it off, became friends, and started a business together. She lives in australia and we live in the US. she is married with a kid and she is been really nasty to my family. She is in control of every aspect of his life; finances, has camera with audio in the living room of his house (they own it for air bnb together), Gps on him, and has tried to buy the love of my brothers and I. Well for a short period i lived in that house rent free which i appreciate. I got kicked out after a manic episode and have been exerting all my engergy trying to get back into that house and pay monthly rent instead. she is decided that she wanted to create a plan for success but its all under her terms. On day four of taking these meds i realized i do not want to live under her roof. If I am going to pay to live somewhere then it makes more sense to me to spend more on rent elsewhere due to the emotional turmoil she is put me through. I am 21 years old and I think that this is the end of the road for me to try and repair my dad and is relationship. He has let this woman that i just found out hes romantically involved with (which to me makes everything far more twisted) someone who has hurt his family so much. This devastated me so much. I want to know if this is me thinking for myself for once, or an impulsive thing. I have had to live at the house i was r**** in for two months while she decides if i should be allowed back. The reason i was kicked out due to a manic episode was because i wanted to go to the hospital for inpatient because i had not gotten a wink of sleep in nearly a week. My dad started telling me how stupid that would be because of i went to the mental hospital she would just kick me out. Its so sick and i do not think i can be in my dads life.

I am just surrounded by people who want to pay me to fuck.

"i (15f) have been depressed for like 2 months now. I have been tired every day, irritable and have no motivation to do anything. i think i had PMDD in the past as well. I have had a therapist for at least 3 months, and she knows of my issues. but when i told her i felt depressed all school holidays, she said, i would too if i was doing the same thing everyday for a long time. and basically said i need to be doing my coping strategies (breathing and grounding) like she says every session. when i said I am depressed to my mum, all she is doing is making me go on more walks with her and do my homework which is just making it worse. my friends said they have been tested for depression and anxiety by doctors immediately and I am just so frustrated. why is it not the same for me? why does my family seem to think its no big deal? am i wrong in thinking that there should at least be a discussion of taking meds and that breathing might not be enough to deal with my symptoms? why am i not diagnosed.",0

"Life is an enigma. Yes, that is a bold statement, and no- I cannot explain what I mean.We are born- individually- each being biological miracles. Our consciousness is gifted to us by our parents and relatives. Our appearance: the product of those who are biologically linked to us. Our thoughts, emotions, our very existence was summoned from unknown origins. Scientists cannot explain our consciousness; they cannot explain how humans perceive reality the way they do. We are remarkable, unfathomable creatures.What separates us is our morals, thoughts, interests and preferences. Our single race has so much diversity. There is much good and there is much evil amongst us.I suppose the above was a bit of preface to what Id really like to write about.Its difficult to ponder a question for years upon years, knowing an answer is most definitely unattainable. The questions about our existence and meaning simply do not have answers- or perhaps they do- but they are so far out of our reach that we cannot imagine the answers to such questions.Why we were given the ability to question our existence, if an answer cannot be attained? Is it an error in biology- or is it a call for humans to figure out our origins and meanings? What if there is an answer?How can we choose what purpose our life holds? Most humans assign a purpose to themselves and chase that (for example, becoming a doctor and healing the sick)- others drift aimlessly- and others do not question their lifes meaning at all. I personally do not understand the latter people.What is it that I want?I have many things for which I am grateful for. I am blessed in many areas of life. I have a wonderful partner- who tries to show me how much he loves me each day- and a beautiful son. I have a home, access to clean water, food, electricity and free health care. I still have both of my parents- and I have not suffered the loss of any immediate family members. I am blessed in many instances but why is it that I do not feel fulfilled?What is it that I NEED to feel fulfilled? And what if its not possible to achieve that feeling of fulfilment? What if I spend my entire life yearning for that enigmatic, something greater?I know that I am meant for more. I feel it deep within myself- in fact- its the one truth which I have carried with me throughout my entire life. But I do not understand what it means. What is that more? Life is an enigma.",0

IDK then, why are not these people who would get hurt, let the person get to this stage ? If this sounds selfish, then telling a person that its going to be better online is a joke too. Sorry to say its a fucking joke. I think when a person's thinking about suicide, its already too late. Its already over. We let that person get to that stage of thinking that, and on top of that, we tell them fake stuff like "" oh its going to be better "", FUCKING HOW ? how do you know its going to be better. let us evaluate the pros of suicide below : Ends your pain. Lessens burden of people who are supposed to ""stick"" with you. Who gives a fuck anyway. Nobody is down for you the way you would think they are. Somehow you are supposed to tough it out. Its meaningless.Cons : Someone would cry for a couple days. Amazon would lose a customer.As a society, we should be discussing good/painless ways to commit suicide. We should be legalising death by medication. But no instead we choose to serve capitalism to save a life. Fucking why ? Why does suicide need to be prevented ?",1

"I am sick of attempting to please people's expectations. I am over the cycle of society. All the emotions that we can feel are simply a scientific reaction, so who cares about love? I do not want children either, but if I do not have them then people will judge me. I believe in God... I think? I do not know anymore. Everything seems to be a distraction from the truth of reality. Once we erase money, entertainment, buildings, all human-made creations, then we will have nothing. But did we ever have anything? It was always nothing but comfort for our minds.I am sick of ableism, racism, sexism, etc. Why cannot we just forget what happened in the past and think about the future of humankind? we are always behaving like God, judging others as if our opinions matter. Judging each other's appearances, intelligence, and social behaviours. But what is the point of it? People judge others so they feel better about themselves.Life is pointless to me. We graduate from school to find a job, use their deserved money to purchase gifts for themselves, but the items will never be truly theirs. One day, everyone who is reading this post will die. Then someone will take their items, whether they are from their family or another. Some will sell their treasures while others will keep them for themselves.

"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so please bare with me. I am 23 years old and I cry almost everyday. I do not have friends and I do not understand why. Each time I have had a friend it ended because they betrayed me. Whether its spreading rumors about me, being friends with my abusive ex, or leaving me out all of the time just being plain shady. I hate my parents. I blame them for how horrible I feel about myself. they have always treated me like shit. But they think they are parents of the year because they have given me nice things. In reality my parents have mocked me crying, they have blamed me for not having friends, made fun of me for it too. They always forced me to do things I did not want to do and it never benefitted me once. Like forcing me to try out for an elite choir when I was a young kid despite my debilitating stage fright and overall just me not wanting to do it. But it does not matter to them. They cannot understand how bad of parents they were and still are. In fourth grade I moved over 1000 miles away from my hometown. I was sad and depressed and had no new friends. My grades slipped. Instead of asking me what was wrong my parents beat me until I could not sit down. One time I caught a ride instead of waiting for my mom who always moves at her own pace, to go to cheer camp. My first year on the squad. I left the house and caught a ride. My mom drove all the way up to the school embarrassed me in front of everyone and took me out of camp. She humiliated me on purpose. One time my parents forced me into a mental hospital. ON VACATION. My parents have ruined my life over their lack of compassion, quickness to anger, control issues and so much more. Its caused me to search for love from people who pretended to care about me. Now since I cut those people off I have no friends. I am out of college so making friends is impossible atp. It seems like no one wants to make new friends at my age because being clique-ish is cool. I am not going to make new friends ever. My career field is generally gate kept by older people so definitely will not have friends at work who are my age and we can hangout. Its been one year since I cut off my shitty friends and I may have only hung out with or interacted with a person my age only 3 or 4 times. Out of an entire year. 10/10 you will find me on my couch in my apartment. Everyday. I never go out even on the weekends because I have no friends. Trust me I have tried reconnecting with people I ent to school with but no one ever puts as much effort into it as I do because mostly everyone has their people already. Anyways, I just wish I could die. If nothing can change in a year nothing will ever change. Friends are not going to miraculously fall into my lap. The only happiness I get is the split second I think about dying and how when I do die Ill finally get to be happy because I will not have to care about being lonely. I hope all of you struggling right now who have friends, who have people that care about you other than your own family, cherish those people. Because something is better than nothing. And I do not have anyone. I do not text anyone during the day. No one texts me. I do not remember the last time i went to a party or the last time I was out past 7. Hopeless.",1
So read my recent posts please and tell me how I survive in prison UK after they take me I am 18 do not have no understanding of the law I have autism what am I eligible for solicitor wise what is it like I have a lot of people who want me dead because of something that happened and I had to protect my family by calling the police I am not scared of dying just scared of the experience as I have pissed off a lot of undercover police officers by confronting them about what they have been doing so when I get took away I am 1000% going to be abused by them I have my word and I do not care about any evidence which has been made to incriminate me I would give a backstory but when I get arrested they will take my phone and probably read this just know I GOT SOMEBODY ARRESTED AND HE SET ME UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS UNDERAGE I BELIEVED SHE WAS 17 her stepdads dad is a former police officer too this was all a setup from the day I met her multiple people I have had good relationships with in the past are making false allegations to get me locked up because of what that guy did This probably seems crazy to everybody nobody has to believe me I would not too if multiple people were saying the same thing but trust me I have been a target since I was 13 and people have successfully ruined my life I have no evidence to back anything up as I cut people off deleted social media accounts etc but now idk what to do just know this was a HUGE SETUP I tried being a people pleaser for years and now I am going to jail for a long time and will probably be ruined in the media what do I do help me Prison because of corrupt police or suicide ?

"So I have been having a hard time sitting still, being alone, and having silence around me without having a panic attack or thinking about self-harm/suicide. it is almost everyday with these thoughts ever since I went to a mental institution(but that was because my best coping mechanism was ignoring my trauma but I cannot do that anymore...) I have all these coping mechanisms like fidget toys and journaling whatever really. You name it and I do it but they do not seem to really work.

The lack of any friends or support group just means I have been internalizing and ruminating on all my negative emotions again, and for the past few weeks I have felt like I could break out in tears at any second. The loneliness I have in life is near crippling, but I do not want to complain any more about it on this board than I already have.Anyways, today I started playing an old game that I used to watch my parents play as a little kid (Tomb Raider II if anyone is curious) just for the nostalgia value, and something about it just hit me really hard. Just all these feelings came flooding back, memories of pure contentment and not having to worry about anything. Being surrounded by people that love me, and not having to be concerned about going to work tomorrow, or paying bills, or trying to save more money. I realized today that those days and feelings are gone, and they will not be coming back. I guess realizing that was my tipping point, because I have been crying off and on all day now. I am just so exhausted. I want to give up so badly but it would devastate my parents if I was gone. Can someone please just tell me things will be okay? Life is so awful right now and I am trying to be strong but it feels like I am fighting a losing battle..Sorry if this is disjointed or all over the place. I am so overwhelmed and I am not good at putting what I am feeling into words sometimes. Just had my first breakdown in awhile. I am so tired, I want this all to be over.",0
"The title says it all. I am 23 years old, coming up on 4 years sober in a month, but yet I feel hopeless. My first 2.5 years of recovery were awesome. I lived in a recovery house, had a great network, went to meetings all the time. Everything was great.The last year and a half on the other hand have not been so pleasant. I moved out of my recovery home and moved back home to go to school. I have not established any sort of network back home, I have just been putting all my time and effort into school and work and now I just have nobody. I cut everyone off at home since I used with them and they were no good to be around, so now I go to school, go to work and then sit by myself. I feel hopeless. I fell back into old ways and started betting on sports constantly because I justify that by saying its not using any sort of drugs but really its just filling it with another addiction.Everyone my age is out partying and having fun, but not me. I am jealous of those people at times, and the same time I am not. I just do not know where I fit in, what to do, or what I am doing at this point. Again, like the title says, I feel hopeless. If you read all of this, thank you for reading my shitty vent. Feel hopeless and alone",0
"And anyone who says otherwise is a fucking liar. The Suicide Hotline is a joke, decent therapy costs a shitton, hell even some subreddits on here have an account age/karma lock. Wtf? I am here for help you goons I do not have time to boost my imaginary points or wait until my account is old enough just post on a fucking self help subreddit.Technically there is help everywhere but they are all behind various paywalls. it is all pointless and I really wish it was not because I do need help but no one wants to help me. I am over it. There is no real ""available"" help.",1
"on paper my life is good and i will acknowledge that but I have just lost any willpower i have to try anymore. i do not really feel like i have a purpose in life. i smoke weed all the time just to feel something. i go through these weird cycles where i get super depressed, then feel back to normal, and then ill get super depressed again and b/c I have noticed that pattern, i do not really feel like getting out of the depression. why the fuck would i just want to crash and burn and inevitably start feeling depressed again i just do not give a fuck anymore",0
"&amp;#x200B;Hello guys, first of all, sorry in advance for my English, it is not my native language, I am struggling with suicidal thoughts for months now and I need some advice on my problem, any advice on what should I do to cope up with my situation would be appreciated.I come from a middle-class family from a third world country, 1.5 years ago I borrowed some savings money from my family, around $1500 because I was interested in stock markets, and wanted to earn some side money as I was doing my higher education, my parents, especially my dad was checking on updates every month on how the money was doing, he is not tech-savvy so he believes what I tell him, long story short, I was a noob and lost 45% of the money, and I could not tell him that I lost 45% since it was a huge amount for us, so I lied to him and told him that I invested the money in a bucket of stocks, and according to the current prices, the stocks I told him that I have has a value of $5000 (both bad and good luck ig), which I lied and I do not have, the 55% of the money I did not lose, I invested in index funds, he thinks I have $5000 worth of stocks, but reality is far different, and although we are financially well and he would not ask me to withdraw the fictional money he thinks I have, I am scared as shit that he would find out, I cannot tell him the truth that I lost the money 1.5 years ago, as it would break him that I lied to him, I cannot hold the lies anymore too, since every month he ask for updates, it hurts me mentally, I am having suicidal thoughts now, and I cannot take it anymore, I cannot talk about this situtation to anyone, because of guilt and shame so I am posting it here using a throwaway account, any advice on how to deal with it would be appriciated, thankyou.. Feeling suicidal, Please give me some advice",1
"I have been up since 6, waking up early is supposed to help depressive disorders so I have been going to bed early consistently, plus the mirt just makes me pass out so I just take it early. I managed to trick myself into exercising again despite finally feeling low pain but instead of enjoying that comfort I just told myself I have to maintain this work I have been doing with my physical therapist if I want to make that comfort last. Now I have zero energy despite drinking 3 coffees and I hurt again, it is not excruciating yet but it will be in another few hours I guess. I got by just taking tylenol yesterday and using lidocaine patches so I really am improving. &amp;#x200B;I cannot believe I have gotten so many things done recently, but I am overwhelmed by how much more I need to get done in order to truly be happy. After my talk with my therapist yesterday I felt happy, she told me I was taking a very active part in my treatment, I said I am devoted to improving my poor mental health and it made me smile feeling that validation that I am not just going through the motions like I have always done throughout my life. I really had a wake up call being in the hospital that last time if I can just stay on this track I might actually get somewhere in life if I do not fuck up or get unlucky like always seems to happen when I get on track. My therapist asked me how it felt feeling better than I was and I said I just question it, I question if it is going to last. She told me that is just my anxiety talking, she expected that answer, I feel lucky that I connected with such a great therapist this time. Yeah, I am crying right now but I have been smiling more than I ever have, I am doing what I am supposed to be doing, the conventional treatments. Why does it have to hurt so badly? My stomach is in a knot",0

"Boyfriend since 2012, fianc since 2017. He cheated on me, I found out about it looking on his computer. He did not deny anything, ever since we have been talking on what to do, for a month. Lots more detail but I am just too tired to type.I am 26/f, and he was and is my world. I do not want to breathe anymore, I do not want to ever open my eyes again. I hurt so much, and I have been down this path before but not feeling this low.I do not ever want to imagine life without him, or him marrying someone else.

I am in the race of life and time passed by Look, I sit back and I watch it Hands in my pockets Waves come crashin' over me, but I just watch  them I just watch  them I am underwater but I feel like I am on top of it I am at the bottom but I do not know what the problem is I am in a box, but I am the one that locked me in (I am Paralyzed) Suffocatin' and I am runnin' out of oxygen, ah! NF - Paralyzed. I am paralyzed",0
"I do not know why I self-deprecate so much. Is it because some part of me still lacks confidence even after I worked so much on it? Am I scared? Am I just lazy? Am I stupid? Or is it just that I have been way too overwhelmed and life has actually been hard on me so to a certain degree this is justified?? I do not know. Perhaps a combination of all I just said. Its almost like I did not want to apply but I did not want anyone else to have it either. Perhaps I felt too sure, thinking this opportunity will always be there?I actually am busy with a lot of stuff. I am in college (although I am a little bit too old for that as well). I have also gone through a lot of trauma (both mild and severe) throughout the years. So I do understand that I need to be kind to myself because I needed time to heal. But I just hate being unproductive and lazy. I hate it when people use excuses to justify their shitty behavior. I have seen how ugly it looks; I do not want to be one of those. There seems to be this repetitive pattern in my behavior that I deny myself from opportunities. Maybe deep down there is an unconscious part of me that feels like I do not deserve to have a better life? Is it because I have been bullied so much in the recent past, that it has left me filled with shame and guilt? I have noticed that I do the exact same thing in dating too. I know I have a great personality and naturally I deserve to love and to be loved, but then again, whenever I want to date, I keep thinking that I need to fix my life first. Like I am not good enough. But I know that is just an excuse. I just do not know why I have all these excuses. I understand that life is already happening in between; there is not supposed to be a perfect moment where I start living. Yet, this broken mentality will not let go, despite the fact that I keep empowering myself everyday.How do I stop?? How do you break free from your past? How do you stop procrastinating when you have ADHD? Yes, meds do help with focus, and self-discipline makes things better, but still, here I am. How do I make things... like... better better? I just lost an amazing job opportunity because I procrastinated so much with applying for it. Now its taken. I feel awful.",0

everything has to be done exactly like on the sheet even if its the exact location of one word. and they keep coming to my room every 2 hours without knocking to come in and point out every single thing i did wrong and walk out this is why i want to live alone the only time they speak to me is when they want to say i did something wrong why the fuck am i being asked by my parents to do fucking write a document for them I am on my break and i just want to be left alone,1

"Recently I started a good job at on the marketing of a big financial company in my country, I am 25 and I have 2 MBAs, I should feel good at a job like this, right? But I do not. I have started 3 months ago, and after 2 years of being mentally fine, now my anxiety is trough the roof, my depression is apparently back with super strength, and I cried 3 times today, I have been imagining death for some time now. I am not actively considering killing myself because I have lost 2 important people to suicide and I do not want others to suffer for my pain, they do not disserve this. As long as I can, I will hold on.. But I really keep thinking like ""maybe today something will happen and this nonstop pain will end.""Worst of all, even tho I know this job is triggering this, I cannot leave, because I really need this money to pay my studies and to live. My best friend and ex-gf is the only person who I usually talked about this Crysis, but recently she had her own Crysis and I cannot tell her about it because I cannot put her mental health in danger.I just feel like a little part of me dies every fucking minute and I need it to stop. I do not even know exactly why I am feeling this, but I want to stop so bad.. I feel like I am dying a bit everyday",0
"I think my life is a mistake from the moment I was conceived. My dad never wanted to have children, and when I was born, he spent years trying to make me change. The truth is I am not the son he wanted me to be. I have always been sensitive, and flamboyant. I did not like sports, I always felt more comfortable when I was around girls, and I later found out I was gay. For years I struggled- and still struggle- with that, not only because I feel like I will never be enough for my father, but also because I live in a very homophobic state in a very homophobic country. I grew up being the punching bag for the boys around me, and that led me to having countless traumas, of which I cannot let go until this day. These traumas caused me to isolate myself because I thought anyone I met would dislike me for being gay. I became really shy and unable to open up to the point where I cannot befriend anyone because people feel like they cannot approach me. The last time I made a friend was four years ago, and I feel terrible for that.I never felt like I was good at anything. The only thing I was proud of was that I (thought I) was smart. I spent all my school years trying to be the best student- and I was- hoping that it would grant me a good future, or maybe a feeling that I was doing something; going somewhere. But today I got the response from my dream university and I could not get in. I am so fucking useless that I was able to fail the one thing I have been preparing for over the last 8 years of my life.I cannot see myself in one, five, let alone 10 years. I have a passion, which is writing. I also really love music. But none of these will give me a future, at least not where I live. I also feel terrible that I am feeling like this, because I was supposed to have a good life. I always had food on my plate, my parents are able to afford all of our expenses, including a few luxuries now and then. There are millions, billions of people who have a much harder time than me, and I wish I could switch places with them, because they would make much better use of my opportunities than I do.I wish I had something to cling to. Maybe the idea of a God who will make everything be worth it in the future. Or that fate holds great things for me in the long run. But deep down I know that all of this- life- is just a sequence of coincidences, and nothing will guarantee that my tomorrow will be different from yesterday. I feel like I was born to die",1

First always dreaming of going to austria, then any european country, then florida. Its obvious none of its meant to be. I do not want to be a burden to you yet again or bother you with sad memories. You deserve the best and most love and appreciation in life and i encourage you to forget me. Or at least not think of me often. I do not even know who or what i was to you. All i wanted was to make you feel happy and loved but i guess i was pretty incapable of that much of the time lol. I hope you can reach what i wanted. hypothetical",1
"For background, I am 21 and have Temporal lobe epilepsy, scarring in my hippocampus, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. Because of that my memory is shit so I have to live with my mom so she can make sure I do not get further brain damage from another cluster of seizures and help with my doctors. My dad is an abusive narcissist manipulative asshole who just got completely out of the picture recently by canceling my health insurance that he did not have to pay a dime for (even though I will prolly need brain surgery) and that was the only string attached. And I cannot get over my dog who was stolen from me, and I loved him more than anything in the world, which kills me every day.I have cut myself in the past and I did so again a couple days ago, cutting down past the fat and into the muscle in my thigh. I was trying to kill myself but then decided to tell my mom so she would not have to find my dead body in a pool of blood. After a day she told me that I was trying to divert her attention to me (essentially saying I am attention seeking) so I lost it on her. I bandaged it up myself and it took forever to stop the bleeding, and I did it myself so I would not have to go to the hospital and be put into another mental health hospital, because the last one I went into had abusive and manipulative nurses and techs, and food so bad I saw a rat run across it, so I ate chips every day.I have 3 good siblings and my 1 and only friend who is like a brother to me, so I stick around because I do not want to hurt them. My sister had a girlfriend who hung herself in their bathroom and my sister now has PTSD, so I know the pain suicide causes, and I wish I did not. It feels like a double edged sword of me ending my own suffering and causing them pain, or them making me stick around and causing me pain.I wish I was not suffering and the world was tolerable, but this world is full of so much suffering and unfairness that it makes me feel like it will never be tolerable. I wish everyone would just hate me for no reason so I would not have to live with the guilt of knowing the pain it will because. I want to be able to cut an artery but every time I cut I wake up from that numbness and think about how it will because others pain, and I wish I could ignore that but I cannot.I could go on a bit more but I do not want to make you read a novel lol.To anyone that reads this, thank you. I do not know how much longer I can last, yet I stick around for others around me (which is not fucking fair) (also long rant)",1
"Hi, like most my life kind of turned upside down when quarantine began. I had a new job that fit well with my college schedule, grades were great everything seemed to be going on track. Once quarantine began I lost my job due to COVID and I fell behind on grades. At first I just felt like shit, kind of numb. Then halfway through I turned things around worked on myself a lot. But the biggest thing getting through depression was thinking about life after quarantine I told myself I would make it out a winner. The first couple of months were great. One of my goals was to start Brazilian jiu jitsu which I love because it pushed me to new heights mentally. Another goal I had was to be more social and go out more. A lot of my goals are in the process or are already done. But Deep down I am still numb. I am not sure why? I know happiness is not a linear path but when I know I am supposed to feel something I my emotions are not there.. a part of me feels like a narcissist that expects things so I cannot enjoy things? Should I seek therapy? Extra: One of the parties I went to had this really attractive girl a majority of the guys there were trying to get at her, the typical talking extra loud or sprinkling a little lie to make them seem more interesting. Me being the typical cool guy I just introduced myself and that was it. Guess it worked because her sister said she was interested in me and gave me her number. I kind of just shrugged it off l. Now I am not trying to boast on the internet that I got this girls number. All my friends hyped up the situation but they do not understand that even after that I still do not feel anything no sense of accomplishment not even a confidence boost. Still emotionless.

I have been wishing Id gone through with suicide years ago so I would not feel so much tension and anxiety now. I think my perception of reality is really really messed up. Especially my perception of other people. I take everything personally and assume its everyone against me. I am tired right now, but it is 3 AM after all.

"Hi, I am early 20s (M) in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself. The relationship was quite one-way I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back, I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional help/counselling recently that i self-referred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoors(vague i know) and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland? Especially at this ageI appreciate it is a lot/huge ask, the amount I have went through just gets so overwhelming to process and I am just so lost and want guidance; i do not know what to do/where to go. I guess it is just so hard to see the wood for the trees, and I do not know what to do and cannot see how things will get better. I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve, which makes me feel more hopeless. I want to get out of this rut I have been in for so, so long and to feel loved/validated again and feel good about myself again, as cheesy as that may sound. Sorry for a low-post I do not like putting it upon people Crippling Loneliness after grim breakup",0

"I (22 M) have always felt beaten down and worthless ever since I was a child. I had a very emotional abusive father who would scream and belittle me over every little thing I did wrong. This has since then made me feel like I can never amount to anything that matters. Growing up I was always the weird sensitive kid in class which led to me not having many friends, and the few I would make always seem to abandon me. This has given me so many trust issues and I just feel as if almost nobody actually cares for me with a few exceptions. Now in my early adult years, I am working a pharmacy tech job that is eating away at my little bit of sanity I have left. I barely make ends meet, I am constantly screamed at and bullied around by customers and I just do not feel that life is worth living anymore. My family is broken, I gave up on religion as it inly filled me with anger and nothing i used to enjoy makes me happy anymore. I have a gf and a rescue dog who I love very much, they are the only things keeping me going. but I am so tired of acting happy and content in life. I do not want to live a life where I just work a job i hate, then come home, put on a fake smile and anxiously wait for my next shift to start. I am just tired and I feel like I need to start worrying about my own needs for once but I just do not know how to. I just do not want to live a life where I am just working to pay bills thn die. Idk my head hurts, rant over for now. I am going to go cry now. sorry for bad grammar I am just tired of everything. (Rant)",0
"i do not know. i think i want help maybe that is why i came here, sorry if this is not the right way to do this or anything but i feel empty inside. i feel numb. i feel like I am going to die at all times, a couple days ago i locked myself in the car, in the heat, and i hoped to god that i would stay there and die. my mom did not care. she knew i was in there. she left me there for a good two hours. i wanted to die but for some reason i texted my father and begged him to help me so I am alive now but I am still getting headaches and dizziness from the heat and my mom thinks I am weakmy mom did not care, she never did. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a good five years now, and I have been looking for a good therapist, or someone to help me and I have been here for so long it is tiring. I am 18 now but i cannot find the energy or will to get up. i keep hoping I will die instead, or that I will kill myself so that i do not have to feel anything anymore. it is empty inside, it does not feel like anything, i feel weak and numb.I have been trying to get better. i think there is a part of me that is terrified of dying, there is a part of me that really really wants to get better. and that part of me is probably why I am still here - there is my sister, who is... she is probably the reason I am still alive. she is 14, she is kind and sweet to everyone around her, and she is struggling at home, and i think the reason i have not gone and done it yet is because the last thing i want for her to do is see my dead body on the ground. she is going through so much, and i want to be there for her until the end. butbut i do not know, it hurts. it hurts, i do not want to live anymore. everyday i find myself laying out the plans for me to end my life, every day i fantasize about it, everyday i wish my mom would get to see my dead body but i know that she would never care.i feel so alone. I have lost all of my friends over the last year because my depression got so bad that i refused to talk to anyone for months. and now I am pretty sure they all hate me. I am pretty sure that I am annoying, too, tiring, exhausting. I am nothing to anyone else, and no one will ever care. it does not matter how much I am hurting, no one's ever going to love me the way that i want them to. it is selfish. but i overwork myself, i push myself, i try so hard to be there for people when they can and yet when i cannot find the energy in myself because I have burnt it to the ground, everyone hates me for it. I have been yelled at for not responding to people's messages. I have lost friends for it. i do not know. I am a high maintenance person and i do not deserve to live, i do not deserve to have friends. I am scared. I am in pain. every single second of my life hurts.I am asking for a lot, i know, because I am mentally unstable, I am too much work, but is it wrong of me to want someone who would go that far for me too? is it wrong of me to want to have someone who would try to be there for me? i want to die. I have told my mom this and she tells me I am guilt tripping her. that she would feel horrible if i died. that she cannot deal with me anymore. she is made *threats* saying ""I will call the hospital. do you want that? do you want me to pay hundreds and thousands of dollars for you?"" she thinks i should get better. she thinks i should move out. she thinks that getting a therapist or a doctor is a waste of time and money. she would rather make a money making pig out of me than care for me. i want to get better. but i also do not know. I am tired. i do not have anyone else to turn to. I am scared if i get a therapist, mom will make me crash all over again. i want to kill myself. I have wanted to kill myself every single day for the last five years, i do not know how I am alive right now. maybe if i end myself, it will feel better, but I am selfish. I am selfish and i do not want to be forgotten. will anyone ever know if i died tonight? is it wrong to just want to be loved?",1

"No I am not doing okay and have not been for a while now. I have been feeling so detached from the world and I have no one. I wish I had family. I wish I was okay. I wish I could be like everyone else.Instead I sit here and fantasize my death every single day.Jumping off the bridge into On going traffic on the freeway or stealing J*****as or G**es gun and shooting myself. Who I do and do not want at my funeral and sometimes thinking I do not even want one at all because I feel like D***a and B***y and N**h would ruin it and make it about them.I have no purpose.I am tired.More then tired more then exhausted.I have been a dead man walking for a long long time now.I am tired of waking up in the morning and feeling okay and then it wearing off so easily.I cannot handle little things that because distress it sets me off.And yes I am medicated and I still feel this way. Sober, not sober, medicated and what ever.I feel unfixable.I AM a burden and an obligation for others.I have no one. Have I mentioned that.I fantasize what it would be like to die so many different ways more then I can fantasize anything good.I will not take on any responsibilities because I do not want to leave anyone hanging that is how unstable I have felt for a long time now. How unstable I am feeling. I do not want to take on anymore bills and then end up killing myself and leaving someone hanging with my end of the bills or debt..I wanted to sell my car and go to California for a bit so I could have my last hurrah.. but selling the car had not worked out..I just want to give all my stuff away and slowly disappear without word.. I want people to think I am on a trip that I never come back from.. eventually they will hear that I am dead.I do not want to be anywhere.I always ask myself.Is being dead like being asleep with no Dreams ? Or is it when everyone goes to the place they believe in ? And if it is everyone going to a place that they believe in then I have no idea where I will go.. I never got the chance to believe in my own universe.I am sitting at a park while someone is waiting on me to hang with them.But I do not want to talk to anyone or be anywhere at all.I am not okay but it is nothing a stupid hospital or meds can fix.How about you ? Are you okay ? Are you okay ?",1
"I know I should not care what others think but part of me worries about others using this post against me sometime. I still need to post it though. So wednesday was the anniversary of when my brother died. For some details I guess check out my post on r/PTSD. I am autistic and really struggle to do a lot of things I want to do when they involve just myself. Its a LOT easier when others are involved. I finally was cleaning my room today, FINALLY, and then I found a spider. I had to take work off yesterday and did get some stuff done and then today but now I am hiding on the couch. I tried asking for help but that did not do anything except show me I should be trying to figure it out myself instead of asking. My dad died last month and I am just so tired of going on by myself. I hope a dog is worth fighting for but there is a lot I need to figure out first and I do not know if its going to happen. Not sure what will happen if I have to wait even longer for that. I also have mild versions of many other disabilities and it does not feel like life should be this hard because of that. I am trying to reach out for help but its not enough currently and takes time to get. Plus others have lives that do not involve me and I hate interrupting that so much. But I cannot do it myself either. I would honestly rather not do it than ask for help if possible but that cannot happen for everything so I am stuck being a burden. I am a major fawner, meaning I try to please when possible and make life easier for others. I prefer others offering than me asking and I keep getting frustrated by minor things, especially when something does not go how I want it to. My laptop decided to stop turning on last month as well and I should just get a new battery but its not that easy. My therapist gave me a different one but it is not a gaming laptop and needed to update when I turned it on. TLDR: I am trying, I really am, but its not enough and I really do not want to bother anyone else. I was FINALLY doing better and then a spider ruined it and now I just want to give up. I have already tried asking for help and I am just a bother and need to figure it out for myself. I might ask for help one more time but now there is a chance of other spiders in my room because I have not been able to keep it clean no matter how much I try. I tell myself I need to clean and I just sit there on my phone instead. I am really trying",1
"My mom was my only other teammate in life. She died suddenly and unexpectedly. She was 57, and I am 28. No father. I am alone. I am stressed from life, loss, and handing her things without a will. One other person close to me; spends time with me but not present in my mess with me. Unable to be communicated with currently. Its been almost 2 months and I somehow feel worse than I did the week of her death. I have a lot of regrets about our relationship. I know I am only human, but she deserved more in life than what she got and I should have given more. I hate knowing that after all of her life, she went back to the nothingness that we were in before we were born. I do not want to die because I think Ill be reunited with her. I want to die because I will not be without her anymore.I am 4 days shy of not having SHd for 1400 days. I am struggling tonight. Alternatively, I want to drive away from the city and turn off my phone for a day. Stop being a mourning daughter, an invisible girlfriend, a tired pet parent of ill animals, a lawyers client, and executor, etc. I truly believe Ill take myself out one day. Maybe Ill give myself the same amount of time as she had. Sometimes, I just do not see how I can make it that long, though. I do not know how I can love the same things I loved before she passed. What did I even love? I foolishly gave a lot of my heart to others. that is about it. I do not have the energy. I do not want advice or solutions. Thank you for reading. My mom died. I am finding it difficult to keep living.",1
Feeling lonely and suicidal. Need to hear somebody is voice.,1
"I miss my home, but my home is destroyed, I am from a small town in Venezuela, the president of the country set regulations for everything on the basis of socialism, what ended up happening was that private companies could not produce and make a profit while selling at the prices the government forced them to, there is no toilet paper, no rice, no pasta, no toothpaste, no food, you cannot buy bread because there is no flour, the only companies producing are the companies the government took and they can afford to sell at those prices since they are subsidized by the oil prices, and as you can imagine, they often fluctuate, This crisis caused over 5.4 million Venezuelans to leave the country since the so-called ""Revolution"" started, current politicians cannot travel to the US because they are investigated for their relations with Drug Cartels, I grew up in a city where I used to see every week trucks loaded with dead bodies of people who would try to go to the mines for gold and would get murdered in there as this is a territory controlled by the military which can do whatever they want since they are backed up by the government which gets their cut of the gold and diamond supply,It hurts me how some people in the country where I live is deeply convinced we have everything in Venezuela or talk greatly about our president when I have friends who were murdered or incarcerated for literally twitting against the regimen, If you are wondering why we do not protest like Cuba is doing right now, a little history lesson for you, every time we do it, the president sends the military to murder us, the internet is loaded with pictures of this, to give you one example of the most brutal one, we had this member of the military who tried to reveal against the government, his name was scar Alberto Prez, they tracked him down and killed him with a rocket launcher, yes, you read that right, they threw a missile to the hose where he was staying with woman and kids. USA, Canada and other countries imposed sanctions on the Politicians about 2 years ago freezing their assets and bank accounts, and people all over the internet talks about how the USA is doing bad to Venezuela, this drives me nuts, if you know anything about the Venezuelan history, at least respect our country by realizing that Chavez and Maduro have done more damage to us than the USA has. We do not see a light at the end of the tunnel,it is hard to see the place where you grew up to go from the promised land to complete decadence. I miss my home, but there is no more home, my story as an immigrant from Venezuela.",0
So yesterday was a weird day. I went to work feeling OK. As okay as I could anyway. And then I just kind of broke down. Out of nowhere I started crying. I went to sit in my car and realised I could not go back in. So I went and asked my boss if I could take the rest of the week as a holiday. Today I got another job offer so just sent in my resignation.But I feel bad. I feel ridiculous for my colleagues seeing me cry. How they were asking what was wrong. How my boss seemed pissed off with me. I feel guilty and like such a weak piece of crap. Like the last memory they will have as me there is a lunatic who just cried out of nowhere. How to stop feeling guilty and stupid about quitting a job that destroyed me mentally?,0
"I have been struggling with constant testicular pain since January. Unreliable doctors have been throwing drugs at me that have offered no relief. One antibiotic caused an allergic reaction that had me bedridden for about a month. One day the urologist says I am completely fine, the next day I am pissing blood. I feel so incredibly alone. Every ambition and hobby I have had has been blown away by this bullshit. Whenever I begin to feel slightly better, some new symptom or issue appears out of thin air. My parents are psychotic and because even more problems. I get that I am lucky enough to be better off than a lot of people. But the pain is keeping me from doing anything I used to enjoy. At 16 years old, chronic health issues are making me want to kill myself.",1

"the number of times I have borderline cried this past week is wayy too much.I have dealt with more stressful conditions alone and not many people to talk to. feeling guilty about doing even something remotely pleasurable / recreational. i have an exam in 2 months, been running every morning, eating okay and forcing myself in all ways I can to ""pretend"" to be normal. And yet, this was the worst week I had(mental health wise) whereas productivity wise the best i guess. I do not want to fuck up and have a reason to be miserable. Even thinking about this brings tears to my eyes. I do not have a reason / cannot pinpoint the because but I do not want to create one.",0

I have been wandering lonely and alone for the past 5 years and it seems like everyone is an enemy, what I mean by that is most people I have bet since school are assholes and bullies. I never had an easy life but the way its going I do not want to keep going on living, and before you judge, my father passed away last month and all I keep thinking about is how much he beat me when I was a kid and then Id go to school and get bullied and beat up there as well its like a never ending pain that does not go away. I do not know what else to do or say I just want to die :( I am always alone.",0
I have been feeling like this for weeks and with my social life crumbling my supports have slowly disappeared. Every day i wake up only to want to go back to sleep. only sleep is keeping me away from my thoughts.

"I graduated high school this year. I got a cool firefighting job set up and I got into my dream college! Well, so far my work rarely contacts me, they have sent me out on one fire. they have been sending others out. My boss never tells me what is going on, I have to get everything through the grapevine. I got the tuition price back from my college and I do not think Ill be able to afford it, so I might be stuck at home for another year.My best friend keeps ignoring me. She only wants to hangout if I am the last resort. she is also been super rude. Everyone in my family works so I am home alone a lot.

"Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. A large part of my s is internal. I wanted to have a good life so I went with what I thought was the most responsible thing to do. Invest my money. 4 years later holding the same companies, I have lost most of it. Then Robinhood entered the picture and took me on a ride of misery and loss I did not think possible. The deeper hole I got into, the more addicted I became the more loss I incurred (and yes I know my equities will rebound only after I am gone as is intended in the fabric of what the market is, but even so I cannot get the many years wasted back and I will not sell them to my death. When they rebound and, please wait until they do, get an advisor to analyze the best time to sell for each equity and split the money evenly between Matthew and Chloe. Please do not make the stock market a part of your life. For most people, it will only bring pain and enrich companies who have no intent on returning your investment. Society and technology have made it implausible that I can live a decent life. After working for years, no girlfriend, my money eaten up by inflation and losing value in markets. Owning a home is an impossibility. My salary barely keeps me afloat and I am a slave to an endless grind leading nowhere. Losing yourself in your passion is the only respite to the pain. do not believe anything the media tells you. People do not want to hate each other. I pray this late stage capitalism post pandemic were in does not take anymore lives than it must. Greed is the root of all evil. Technology is the leaf that allows it to grow.

"I have been convinced my depressive states were environmental, only to remove the environment and still have issues. Its kind of incredible I can be sad, believe I know what is causing it, only for it not to be something more. Although I do support the changes I made, it is as if some depressive tendencies have just followed me and taken a new form in my new environment.Dear brain: may I speak to the manager?

"Writing this down as I comtemplate if I should kill myself later. I am a 21 year old dude and I am writing this down just to express myself and just for the sake of distracting myself from this thoughts. i have been having this dark thoughts every now and then, but they have been the only thing I only ever think about for the past few days. There are times when I actually think of doing the deed and when should I do it. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of my mom sobbing uncontrollably as they lower my grave down. Its just so hard to keep on going when you literally have no motivation to just keep on living. The only person that I can turn to is my mom, since she is the only person who actually givesa shit about me, everyone else just does not care or they pretend to care and then they talk shit behind my back.I just burst into tears as I am writing this down. I actually never had considered the fact that I would kept this shit inside for so long and and now that its out in the open everything just burst out. I have been trying out the hobbies that my mom's been suggesting but they only provide temprorary relief.To be completely honest, writing down the stuff I have been feeling has helped a bit. I never thought I would use Reddit like this, but I had to let it out somehow.

But how am I meant to do that, when my social skills or networking skills are crap and no one cares etc.Right now the only thing I think I can do, is just take each day as it comes, focus on activities that bring me joy.And just give up on being part of a system that clearly does not care for me.Damn human need for some kind of gratification, to feel accepted by others.I have always been the odd one out, on the outside looking in, never invited out etc.Why do I keep trying to be part of a society that does not care nor want someone like me.To live a human life is to live a suffering existence.

"I would made a way more detailed post before. But it was my birthday yesterday, and it was incredibly triggering... suicidal ideation was through the roof. Just thinking about what my last year was, feeling I have no future, I have made no progress in getting better, I am growing older with no family support, no financial stability, no career, no stable relationships, nothing to fall on and no one that could take care of me when I grow old or inevitably get sick (cancer runs in my family). It all made me incredibly depressed and reassured me that shooting myself in the head is the best option. As my birthday got closer and closer I started making more concrete plans to commit suicide, but it all fell apart because I could not get the gun on time. Ideally I would have driven out to the woods and pull the trigger in my car on my birthday. But now my birthday passed, and I feel the enormous pressure of building a future for myself, of setting goals for the new year, of getting my shit together.... but I cannot even look past the next day. I have already stop caring about taking care of basic responsibilities and day to day things. I wanted to be gone by my birthday... I do not know if I should wait another year. Birthdays, triggering?",1
"it is just like last summer. As soon as school ended it started again. My mom is insane and I cannot stand it, she calls me all sorts of things for no reason and it is gotten to the point that I just do not care anymore. Last summer I felt the same, just because of final exams and my parents not being satisfied with what I am. I wanted to die then and I am starting to want to die now. The school year has been peaceful; starting highschool was ok, I guess, except for the fact that everyone thinks I am a loser. I kept to myself all year and now there is people in my class that think it is ok to treat me like shit, and if I say anything that pisses them off, ta-da, I am not taken seriously. It sucks.I had enough of my mom being fucking nasty, and my dad being an alcoholic that thinks we do not know he gambles tons of money away. If it had not been for my baby sister existing I definitely would have done it. I am so fucking sick of being called all sorts of things and not being able to say anything back. I cannot even defend myself or give my opinion. My whole family thinks I am good for nothing because I do not work my ass off in around the household like one of my cousins, but I see no reason to do so. I hate the countryside, I hate living here and I want to move to the city as soon as possible.Every day sucks: I wake up (or am waken up by my mom), drink coffee, and babysit my sister for the rest of the day. I cannot have free time, I have to be available at all times so my mom can chat with the neighbors and my dad can do jack shit all day because his goddamn tummy hurts. Maybe it would not hurt if he tried to smoke or drink less, but only he works in our household, so he ""can afford it"" by his own terms even though we barely have enough cash to make it through the day.Today I felt different though: After my mom got tired of screaming at me, I felt something almost snap inside of me. And I did not care anymore. I feel like I need to cry and scream at the same time, but I also just do not care about what is happening around me. I have felt this way before when thinking about suicide, I felt comfort. Ever since last summer the idea of dying seems comforting. Maybe it is my mind becoming used to it, or maybe it settled in that I might end up like that sooner than I think. I am not thinking of killing myself right now, but if this summer continues this way I might consider just chugging a bottle of pills and being done with it. Sorry for boring you out, I hope you can get back the time you spent reading this. See ya, kind stranger. I feel peaceful.",1
"Just your average sandwich generation helping out family financially and with technology throughout this pandemic. And you know what? When I gave my aunt fucking money to pay for her fucking credit card debt worth 28k she told me ""I do not want your fucking money because you will throw it back at my face when the time comes because you are that kind of person."" And right when she was about to pay she literally asked ""Okay where is the money you are going to give me???""We paid, technically I PAID, and she went on and on about how bad of a person I was. No thank yous, no I will pay you backs, just insults. Fuck the older generation they do not deserve anything. And they blame me for being depressed and spending money on mental health that does not exist. Like they literally say my money is wasted for my consultations. Even bought a bike for myself using my own money and they go on and on about how much of a waste of money that buy was. But everything they make me buy for them they barely use. And they never call it a waste. Depressed as fuck but I am so angry about how fucked up this narrative of life is. Fuck that shit. People really be blaming you for just being you",0

"No one takes my anxiety seriously. In my family, it is no secret that I struggle with severe anxiety. I do not want to give too much detail, but they do little things that make me feel like they really do not give a crap about my anxiety. Like how I hate taking pictures, especially with other people, because I feel self-conscious and literally feel like the ugliest person alive. I told them about it and they apparently understood. Then a few days later they force me (Literally pull me by the arm) to be in a picture with them that is not even important and I instantly lost all my trust in them.I remember running to my room afterward and bawling my eyes out. I did not even want to look at the picture. I know it is not even that big of a deal, but it really affected my ability to open up to people because I felt that no matter how supportive they act, they will never really take anything I say or feel seriously and I just felt like the biggest wuss ever because, I mean, it is just a picture, right? why the hell am I so scared of a picture?Of course, this is not the only thing I am dealing with. I really hope I am not the only one that is going through this, but I do not feel human anymore. It feels like my mind has detached from my body. I do not feel present. It feels like I am floating and like I am not alive. Idk how to explain this, but it gets even worse during stressful situations. I do not know what I want anymore. It feels like my body is trying to tell me something but I do not know what it is.I remember when it started. I had just had the biggest mental breakdown I had ever had and I just went numb afterward and that numbness has not gone away since.I do not know man. Life is just so fricking tiring and lonely.

"About 2 years ago now I tried to kill myself. I was 22 yrs old and in an extremely abusive relationship, I slit my throat with a knife and was rushed to the hospital when a social worker witnessed the event. I had been depressed my whole life and suffering from ptsd without treatment for years. I was unsuccessful obviously and once I was treated I was immediately forced into a psych hold for 72 hrs. This turned into two weeks in the psych ward, not because I was unstable but because I had noone who was willing to pick me up. I was not allowed access to my phone and did not remember anyone's numbers. Noone looked for me, noone asked if I was ok. Not my husband, not my parents, not a single person I loved cared enough to see if I was alive. When I finally got ahold of my grandparents I was able to be released and they did not even know what happened. I disappeared for two weeks as a single mom ( husband was in work release) and noone noticed or asked. When I got out and reached out to people I was told some extremely hurtful l things that made me wish more than ever I had been successful and am better off dead. My husband I came to find was not even aware what had happened. My in-laws who witnessed the event chose to tell him I just ran off and left my kids there. Well that was not the case and when I got back and informed him he was the only one who cared and was shocked that he was lied to. Well two yrs later now and I still never got to talk about it with anyone but him which is not great, at the time leading up to the attempt he was abusive, that has since ended but I was not able to really talk about why I wanted to die with him. Now my family refuses to invite me to family functions saying the kids can come but I am not welcome. I wish everyday that I had died that day. I feel like everyone hates me for doing it but I was in so much pain, and isolating me to where the only person I have is my husband ? That jus feels so messed up to me, am I selfish for thinking it is messed up that I cannot have family now? it is just me n my kids and they do not need this burden not do they know what happened. They are what is keeping me here but I am in constant pain knowing I have absolutely noone, I try to make friends but they do not want that in their lives. Like how am I supposed to feel better so I do not act selfishly when EVERYONE looks down on suicide instead of helping or being there? Sorry needed to vent thanks for any advice how to move on from this My family isolated me when I tried to commit suicide",1

"I am 25m and a graduate student. So I have been abusing alcohol a little too much lately, as much as I can afford. it is been some days and it is become a routine thing now. Idk if I can call it binge drinking yet. Long story short - I cannot do a thing right, never have. I do not want to either. I am not passionate about anything in life. One of my parents has completely disowned my and the other wants to let go of me as soon as possible. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in life interests me( except drinking). I have no passion, no intersts or hobbies. I do not have the incentive, motivation or the resources to go out there and find my thing. I do not have the motivation to survive left in me either. If my folks throw my ass out on the streets tomorrow, I would rather starve and die than beg/borrow/steal/work. In the short run, there are multiple assingments that I am supposed to cover but none of that shit seems doable because I just do not feel like I will be able to do it. And before some of you say something about how I have come this far and how much I need to push through, let met tell you people something - I am done. This is as far as I can go. The past is embarrassing and there is nothing to look forward to in the future. I know I am going to live and die absolutely alone. The way I see it, a job that supporst my drinking tendecies should be good enough till I drink myself to death. Any idea on how long it will take me to drink/smoke myself to death? OR Is there an alternative to all this? Tl;dr Should I drink and smoke myself to death or live a life of misery for the rest of my days? It feels like nothing in my life matters except alcohol.",0
"Hi everyone. This is going to be a different post from my prior two. Feel free to read about why I am going to end my life in a few months in my prior posts if you want to. Here are some of my hopes for the future after I am gone. I am an old millennial. I am as old as you can be and still be a millennial. I have witnessed firsthand how millennials and younger have had to deal with horrible recessions and wages not keeping pace with inflation. Home ownership is also now becoming an impossibility without being dangerously close to bankruptcy even if you can afford to save a down payment while working a job that barely pays the rent. I am in finance and do ok financially, but grew up poor and have had struggles. My first real job paid enough to have a nice one bedroom apartment in a great neighborhood and now that same entry level job would barely keep a crappy roof over my head. Life is unfortunately getting harder, but it does not have to be this way. I am encouraged by the labor shortage and the remote working revolution. let us just call the labor shortage for what it really is. it is a bunch of companies not paying a living wage and then complaining that they cannot find people to work. All jobs in the United States should pay a living wage, period. If their business model does not support a living wage, they need to go out of business. Please continue to fight the good fight and resist these crappy companies and jobs. They will only change if they are forced to change. If you are fortunate enough to have a job that can be done remotely, resist the employers push to return to the office. Either demand more money for the extra time and commute or quit for a remote job. They want control over you. Millions of us proved for over a year and a half that the company can make money, we can be productive and have more time for us. To be able to live anywhere we want. To have more freedom. Now, they want to return to the old ways to control you. Resist it. Understand that you have value. A good employer should treat you like you are in a mutually beneficial relationship. Again, companies will revert back to the old ways and force us into long commutes, time away from family and force us to live somewhere we do not want to live if you allow them to get away with it. Punish their bottom-line by resigning in massive waves until they get the message. Forcing me back into the office was the final nail in my coffin. Do not allow them to get away with taking even more of your freedom. Having a living wage, a nice roof over your head and more freedom does not guarantee happinesses as I have experienced, but I also know it is damn near impossible to have happiness if your basic needs are not met. I am also encouraged that social acceptance around depression seems to be increasing. I have noticed more people publically talk about their problems even in the workplace. Yes, we have a long way to go but the trend is encouraging. I really am encouraged by younger people questioning the status quo. I just hope they win and make the world a slightly better place. It will not resolve all problems. For example, it would not do anything to cure my loneliness, but financial problems and struggle are one of the leading causes of depression. The younger generation has an opportunity to improve the way things are. Good luck to all of you. I truly hope you find peace and happiness. I do not have anyone to talk to in my life and reddit has been one small pleasure during my time of extreme unhappiness. Thank you all. General advice to people and some trends that I hope will continue after I am gone",1
"I did have some people reach out to me and I truly appreciate that. I am sorry I did not respond, and will not be responding. I ended up giving myself a horrible migraine, the kind that lands a person in the hospital. Maybe my body was trying to tell me something. It does not matter. Atm I am just wasting time on a foolish hope, but even that will be gone eventually. Ill give some more context for anyone interested. So on with itAfter 20 years, my husband is demanding a divorce. Seemingly out of nowhere. Sure we have had our ups and downs over the years. Who does not?However, this has completely blindsided me, because I honestly had no idea this was coming. I have spent our life together, always making my decisions for him, so that we could be happy together. From having kids I did not want, to giving up my jobs to stay home with those kids, maintaining a relationship with his toxic mother when he did not have one with her, allowing him to just carte blanche make decisions regarding new pets coming into the home, and on and on and on. I am pushing 40 (which is still young) and I have a 15 year gap in employment, so it does not matter what I can do or have done, job prospects are basically nil for me.My life has not been the easiest, and while in the beginning of this with my husband, I did struggle with adjusting to everything being so far away from imagined. I came to terms and I was by and large happy with what we have and have built over the years. Maybe the issue was I did not express that enough. I do not know. I do know at some point over the last 6 months, hes become uncommunicative and has been dealing with a massive amount of stress/pressure at work. I have done my best to recognize that and I thought giving him space would help him. Clearly I was wrong. My entire world is coming to an end and I really cannot deal with it. Nothing will change for him but everything will be changing for me. I really do not see myself making it to the other side of this. I have already got a plan and all I need to put it in motion. The only thing stopping me is the tiniest glimmer of hope he will come to his senses, as I do not want any of this. I already know that is foolish and I am just wasting time. I really wish I was stronger than this. Again, thanks for reading. Wasting time",1
"Once in a while, I go on Instagram/Snapchat. I see a bunch of my (irl) friends re-posting things like ""this user is depressed"" and a ton of other depression/mental illness related posts on their public stories. Some of them post monthly ""mood reports"". The happiness level is always very low, and the anxiety level is up there. I really try not to, but a part of me thinks they are faking it. Though I obviously should not jump to conclusions so fast. there is also a part of me that believes them, and I cannot help but envy them for their confidence. How can they post things like that for everyone to see, when I give it my all to hide how I am feeling every day? I can just imagine the other viewers replying to their stories like ""Are you doing alright? I am here to talk."" and frankly, that makes me so envious and and longing for someone, anyone other than strangers on this app to talk to. It makes me sick to my stomach and I hate it, because I know I am being extremely selfish when I think about the way I am probably suffering just as much as they are, but they have support and I do not. I do not have anyone to lean on. I have not told a single person since the day I started feeling this way. I wish I could just muster up the courage to tell a family member or a friend. But the thought alone makes me sick to my stomach. So for now (and probably until the day I die), I will have to fight depression alone. My friends are so confident in sharing their depression",0
"I do not know what is wrong with me anymore. I do not have the emotional capacity for most things, and some days I really do not want to be here. Sometimes it feels like nobody really cares. I feel like I have been looking the wrong places for validation or acceptance and its so difficult for me to continue on. I ruin almost every relationship I get in when I drop the facade of being fun, free, and nonchalant. I really wish I were in therapy. You know what hurts the most? It feels like everyone is gone. Friends, the one person I started to like..life feels very weird right now. I am so confused and I just want things to feel okay again. I want to feel okay again. I have lost myself",0
I do not really mean in a romantic way. I mean just as a human. I miss other humans! I miss having conversations and learning things about people. I want to go on adventures but I have no one to come with me. I just want to laugh with someone else about things. being a human that is not around a lot of other humans kind of sucks. life really sucks alone,0
"I put in my notice last week at the place I was working at. My last day was supposed to be Friday, but they let me go today. I was a temp so there is nothing I can do or say. I was leaving because they had told me things would change and nothing did in the two and a half months I was there.I have another job lined up. I start on Monday. But I had financially planned on working 40 hours this week. I came back from a medical leave last week. I just feel like shit. I am worried things will not work out at the place I am going to. What if there are more lies there! What if my new manager ends up hating me? What if its really stressful there as well? I had applied to a lot of jobs and did quite a few interviews. This new place is not bad, but its not what I really wanted. There was one company I so wanted to work for, but they turned me down last Monday. I am still sad about that for some reason.I hate how I am. Too intelligent to enjoy dumb things, but not smart enough to hang with intellectuals. Too mentally ill to keep a job long term and have a career, but not mentally ill enough to get on SSI or even get into a comprehensive therapy program. Its like I am never right. No matter how hard I try, my life always feels like its one mistake away from crumbling. I just want to stop being so damn sad. Left and Leaving",0
"I am a 23 year old female and I have been struggling with motivation since I was fourteen, but it continues to get worse and worse. At this point, I cannot find the motivation to do the simplest tasks like replying to texts, making doctors appointments, filling out job applications, and taking my medicine. I have always been really smart, so much so that I managed to get into a pretty good college despite having a 2.7 GPA in high school. I did not do a single assignment last semester and ended up getting almost all Fs. The weirdest part is that I do not feel depressed. I have no motivation to do anything, but I am pretty content with my lifestyle of laying in bed, watching TV, and eating. Granted, it makes me feel like shit to do absolutely nothing, but I am not particularly unhappy with it. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD but have not had a depression diagnosis since I was in my younger teenage years. I am starting to fear so much for my future. I have terrible grades in school and I cannot even manage to apply for a job. My life is literally in shambles and I am having panic attacks almost daily because of it. I am really sick of living like this. Does anybody else struggle with this and if so, have you found anything that helps? I am starting to think that Ill be stuck like this for the rest of my life. I have no motivation to do even the smallest tasks.",0

"I fucking did it again. I hurt someone again and left them miserable. I am tired of this bullshit. I cannot believe I made them feel comfortable talking to me and hurt them in the end. Who the fuck is giving me the right and freedom to hurt and disappoint people? Never have I been able to make someone happy. Not once. Even in the slightest bit. Might as well end it guys.

"Two years ago I was really depressed and I started feeling pain in both my hip flexor muscles. I saw a lot of doctors, did physical therapy, did an X-ray, a MRI...and everything looked okay to the professionals. The last doctor I saw told me that it was mental. I stopped taking the meds I was prescribed and went on with my life and they eventually went away. Now my legs are hurting again because I am severely depressed now. Just want to know if anyone has experienced something like that. Also I never fell or hurt myself in anyway so that is why I am askin. Whenever things become really stressful and I hit rock bottom I start feeling pain in my legs. Has anyone experienced something like that?",0
"Hello, I am celebrating my 25 birthday this week. I am in awe and have a loss for words.I did not know where to write or who to vent and I am not trying to take away from anyone , I am just contributing and sharing !I grew up lower middle class almost poor family , grew up in Canada. I was raised by 2 parents. Of which were not the greatest. I do not mean the type to say no tv after 9 or no sweets because they will rot your teeth kind. They were aggressive , always fighting manipulating each other. Being the oldest a lot of the hate and anger was directed towards me. My father beat me relentlessly and made me think I was never good enough , a failure , a mistake and etcMy mom had control in other ways. Due to the relentless bullying , I was suicidal at the age of 8, I was bullied at school too by close friends and then I went on for years not having friends and not having Anybody to talk to or confide in. My parents divorced and it got worse I was put in over 30k in debt helping support family while still trying to achieve higher education and work. I dealt with alot and it was never easy , then in 2016 my life took another huge turn I got into addiction in which I am fighting my way out but everyday is a struggle. I have been in a huge depression and financial ruin. I have panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. My life has been one bad thing after another and each time I trusted someone of shared myself with them I am always burned. I saw countless therapists and countless counsellor.I thought the only way to escape is drop everything and drive on the highway and keep driving and find a small town and settle down there and cut all communication with friends family and loved ones.Sad is not it I even started to delete all social media and just take myself off the grid It has not been easy ,I lost a family member and my dog who were both my rocks ! there is is not a day I do not think about themI find solitude in being alone and I started to do things alone that frightened me , going hiking alone , eating at restaurants alone , doing late night drives alone. I ve been pushing my boundaries and pushing my comfort zone to find true happiness or at least just find comfortI for sure thought Id never make it to 25 , I thought I was going to end it all before the age of 25. But here I am , call it faith , call it resilience but I am here.Thanks for taking the time to read did not think Id make it here",1
"Honestly I am not doing too good. I tell people this a lot, but I do not usually explain it because I know they will get worried about me. I have some trauma that my ex caused (cheating, mind games and lying as well as making me feel like I am not significant). Which has downright flipped my mind upside down. I go through really bad episodes where I am feeling super down for about a week or 2 and then I go normal and then it repeats. I do not really feel my old self also, I just feel like I have no purpose in life because everything I dreamed of just vanished. I get motivated to do things, but then after a while I just cannot because my mind starts to make me think about all the trauma I have been through. I do not think it is just ex stuff also, it is also from childhood trauma too and it feels like I cannot have a normal life or fit in as I am not like ordinary people. Which sometimes makes me just feel like ending it all....I just needed to rant, but help or advice would go a long shot. Trauma causing me to feel like crap",0
"I will try to keep this relatively brief if I can. I am suffering. I was diagnosed with ""Severe depression with suicidal tendencies and PTSD"" when I was 12 years old. I received treatment and things went generally smoothly up until this year. I have joined the military 3 years ago and this job has absolutely stressed me beyond anything I could have imagined. I started having severe depressive episodes to the point where I have come extremely close to killing myself multiple times for years. On top of that, I am in charge of a specific section with only one person in it besides me so with the workload, my own extreme loneliness, and not being able to take a vacation for more than a week, I am at my lowest point of my life. I have tried so hard to make things better with myself by working out and getting in better shape, going out with my work friends more, and taking time for myself...but nothing is working for me anymore. I just go home and lay down on the couch to watch YouTube and TV and just wallow in pain. I no longer take care of myself, just enough to not raise any suspicions about me at work. I lie so much to everyone that I have a great life when in reality I am a fucking failure with no luck in terms of romance, sex, friendships, being a good brother/son/uncle, and a good leader. I feel like my empathy has died because I am starting to notice that I only really care for babies and animals, not even my family I can empathize with anymore. I sleep about 2 hours at night, I barely eat anymore, I barely work out, and I barely leave my house besides for food. I have turned to binge drinking just so I can feel some sort of happiness because being alone with my thoughts in painful. I cannot cry anymore and all I feel is constant anxiety, stress, and this seething rage that just never goes away. My family has a history of mental illness and I hypothesize that I might have Bipolar 1, but I cannot get it diagnosed. Because of my status as a military member, I cannot get it diagnosed because I know that I will get kicked out for it being a ""Psychotic mood disorder"". I know it is best to get some professional help because if my supervisors and family knew how badly I wanted to kill myself, it would more than likely ruin my life and reputation. I am trying to hold out til next year when I officially get out and can move away and move on to a better job, but I do not know if I can hold out anymore. I still have hope that things will get better but that light is starting to fade and I am seriously contemplating just ending my life before I ever really had a chance to live it. I want the things normal people have but I do not know if I ever will. I want to establish roots in a community, have a family, live a normal life with friends and family...but I do not think I ever could. I cannot imagine I will get better and it haunts me that I am a 22 year old man and I might end up in Hell, or the nothing, or whatever the fuck we end up. I want to find peace and just live a normal life....a better life than the one I have only seemed to ever know. My heart hurts so much and I really do wish to get better, but I do not know if I ever will. I do not even know where to start to change myself. Please help me because I do not think I am strong enough to help myself anymore... I do not know where else to go now.",0

"For so long now nearly a decade I have been aware of this feeling of wanting to kill myself. I have thought about the best options, in terms of pain, speed of deaths and the economics of it. During that decade my mental health has fluctuated lots and there have been times were I have not been suicidal but still I was not happy. Everything now is sort of crashing down and the impending fear of loneliness often creeps up on me. it is somewhat not even about being sad anymore, its bored of being sad. Life has somewhat become meaningless if everything I do, even sometimes when I succeed, I am still not happy. I think about my family, my friends and acquaintances but there sadness when I am truly at my lowest really means nothing and sadly I do not care. I fear myself and my unpredictability. I am tired of living",1

Everyone says that time heals the past but the things that have happened cannot be fixed they are permanent me and my gf just broke up and we were being civil but now its like she hates me, but maybe i should not care because she is part of the reason i feel like this i cannot stop spiralling people told me working would help but now i just feel shit for a different reason i have tried to kill myself before, i took an overdose but the hospital saved me. I am stupid but want to be smart, I am lazy but want to be active everyone wants so much for me but i cannot meet there expectations and then when i can they think its something that i am choosing i am probably going to die soon but that is okay i do not think i am right for this world Please help me",1
OMG WHAT IS LIFE ALL MY LOVE ONES ARE GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY AND ME TOO. AND I am SCARED OF NOT KNOWING what is going to HAPPEN TO MY LIFE.

I have set my deadline. It feels like such a relief to know Ill be gone by then. The thought of it makes me happy. I will finally be free from this hell I have been living in.I have had a really bad week. My only friend (who I have romantic feelings towards but am too much of a scared loser to tell her) has been ignoring me and I feel I have hit a new low. She is the only person that makes me happy and the every time I spend time with her I actually feel happy to be alive. But then as she leaves its right back to reality. I have been cutting so much recently and its draining all of my energy. I cannot focus on anything I used to enjoy and am struggling to get any work done. I have a few family events I am going to that will be a final goodbye of sorts and then it will be time. I cannot wait. The years of self harm and suicidal thoughts will finally climax and end how they should. I have never told anyone about any of this so thanks for reading &lt;3 My plans are made,1
"How do you live with depression? Even more so, how do you live with depression as an empath? How do you manage to wake in the morn and pull yourself from the comfort of nothingness? How do you spend your day to day? How do you cope with socializing, when the depression is eating away at your very being? How do you find the courage to keep one foot in front of the other, albeit I bet, with head down...how do you love someone so fucking much, when all you want to do is not be here anymore. Hypocrisy? Lifeline.... How do you live",0
"This will be really long, since i have not opened up to anyone and i want to say everything here, so I do not think anyone would read this. It all started last year, when me and my best friend randomly became friends with a boy from our school, after online classes started. we suddenly got close and were known as a trio and the boy started liking my best friend. he confessed to her after some days, only to get rejected by her since she already had a boyfriend. that pissed him off, and they had a fight and blocked each other everywhere. i was asked to do the same.after some months, in my mathematics class he texts me saying that he wants to be friends with me again, and i unblock him. we became quite close, and somewhere he had begun calling him my best friend. it is not like i minded it, so i went with it. he started going out with a girl during this time, whom he said that he liked a lot, but i knew that he only wanted a girl. this pissed me off a bit, but i did not say anything. we were quite good friends during this time, but the way he treated the girl annoyed me a lot. he went as far as asking another girl for n*des while he was with her, and when asked, he termed it as a joke. despite all this, I was still friends with him.The last straw of their relationship was when the boy forced himself on the girl inspite of her asking him to stop many times. that was it, i was ready to break my friendship with him. i cared about the girl, and i could not be friends with someone like him.this is where the entire problem began.i wrote him messages, saying that I wanted to end our friendship, and i think it was during this period when i started getting manipulated by him. he kept nagging me for forgiveness, and convinced me that he was the victim in that situation and that it was not intentional. i knew that this was wrong, but I think it softened my view for him, a bit. i wanted to hate him, but it was practically impossible for me to do so. so i started talking sh*t about him in group chats and calls where he was not present, so that my friends would think i hate him.somewhere during all this, he was again my self proclaimed best friend, and along the line i lost many friends too, which made him the only support i received in my life. when all my classmates talked sh*t about me, he was my support. or so i thought. i tried getting rid of him from everywhere. blocked him, ignored him, everything. but somehow he still contacts me and i have no idea how. he can go as far as calling my parents to tell them that I am ignoring them and tell them to ask me to unblock him. i hate him, very much, and I have tried countless times to push him out of my life but he keeps coming back. I even faked having a boyfriend, so that he leaves me, but he did not, and said that he would wait for me till i broke up with him. after all this, he keeps saying he loves me, did so for a long time and he is done a lot for me.along the line, i kept getting softened and manipulated by him, and mistook his obsessiveness and toxicity for love and affection towards me. I had a therapist but she kept asking me to focus on my studies and one time i tried opening up to her she shut me up saying this is all just superficial sh*t. somewhere along, i started taking anti depressants, which were of no use since they make me feel numb and devoid of feelings. I cannot talk about this with my parents either, since they love him and think that he is a really good guy. and when i try to talk to them, they ask me to take anti depressants and that they are busy for my bullsh*it.to be honest, I am a very impulsive person. I do everything out of impulse. I cut my lower back length hair short because of impulse. and then i regret everything. my last straw was a similar decision. he said he loved me one day, and with all my tangled feelings of love and hate towards him, i agreed upon dating him. a decision i deeply regret, since it was really my last straw. it was suffocating for me and i just wanted to run away from everything. but i could not break up because that would mean me losing the support of my classmates all together, since he had already manipulated all of them into thinking that he loves me a lot, they would think I am toying with my feelings. i could not do that anymore, so i broke up with him, with my best friend's support. i thought i would finally get rid of him, but he created a lot of drama saying that i toyed with his feelings and everything. and all my classmates called me all sorts of things because of that. he somehow even managed to befriend my best friend too.I am just done with all this. I have run away countless times from home, but i always end up coming back because i have nowhere to go. Recently, I overdosed on anti depressant pills, and currently I am in the hospital. I really thought I would die, but I did not. I do not know what to do, and how to get him out of my life. I am going to get into a college soon, and I just cannot focus on my academics or myself because of all this. I have studied my entire life to become a doctor from this college of my dreams, but now I just want all this to end, because of that one guy. I want to stand up for myself, but i do not know what to do. I just do not know what to do.If you read it till here, thank you very much, i really appreciate it. I have no one to open up to, and i need help",1
"I wish you could read this but I know you would not. Because I cannot give it to you. I sit here tonight with tears in my eyes thinking about my life. I do not even know where to begin. My mental health is fucked up. If I see a genie, Ill probably have just one wish To die. And rest. In peace. And maybe make it to heaven if it does exist. So I guess this is it. I just wanted to say for all the times I kept mute when you spoke to me, for all the times it seems I get mad at simple questions you asked that I should just give a straight answer but instead it seems like I am mad at you for asking. For all the times I make you think is he going to get mad at this before you ask me your loving motherly questions, I AM SORRY. I am truly sorry. I know it keeps happening even though I wish it does not. I wish I could talk to you like a loving son would talk to his loving mother. I wish I could answer your loving question which are questions you ask to ensure I get the best out of everything. I wish everything can be normal but it is not. I am not normal. My brain is fucked. Depression has eaten the shit out of me. It feels like I have lost the ability to take any joy in life. The reason why it seems as though I am mad is because I am so fucked everything triggers me. You ask about my school; there was once a time the word school triggers me. When you ask, I wish I could tell you but instead I fall into depression. You talk about my sisters, I have a panic attack. My uncle or sisters calls your number I have a panic attack. I wish I could just experience peace. I have been abused for all my childhood and most of my teens. I still suffer from these. I have vivid nightmares and flashbacks. You have seen me wake up crying a couple of times. Sometimes when we share the bed, I kick you in the middle of my sleep. I am sorry for this too. Its my nightmares. I am been tortured in my dreams. My abuse are fresh in my memories that my dreams are as though its happening again. I wish I could explain to you all and you would understand. I do not just chose to be in bed all day, moody, sad, and listen to sad song. I do not choose to be this way nor do I like the way I am. For all the times I was called lazy, I was not lazy. I was dieing a death that eats you up slowly. For all he questions you ask which have triggered me every single time. For the once you asked today that fell on deaf ears followed by a long silence or an odd answer, For all the ones you will ask tomorrow and the next, I wish I could answer them all. I am sorry you have to feel this way. Trying your best not to hurt me, trying your best to see me happy. But all I do is let my depression eat me away like a vulture feeding on its carcass. I wish I could be genuinely happy but at this point, all I want to do is rest. I want to experience peace. The kind of peace I do not have to worry about any single thing. The kind of peace you do not have to worry about me. The kind of peace where I cease to exist. Yeah I have big dreams, but it would not matter when I rest. I tried to kill myself unsuccessfully and I am afraid it might happen again this time successfully but why do I fear? This is what I have wanted when I spent years practicing with the knife, when I swallowed the pills and watch you watch me in pain as I puke my gut out, when I started learning to tie a noose, when I did lots of reasearch on the most painless way to go. Though there are things you do that hurts. Like you saying I did things I did not do or using my name to get money from family members. I have said it several times to you that I wish I was never born. I told you once out of frustration that you should kill me. That I did not ask to be born. I have never told you, but despite my life full of abuse, deep down you are my mom and I do love you just as a child loves its mother. Sometimes I have this feeling inside that I just have a few more years before I finally end my life in college studying the course you all want me to study When I actually want something else. I guess that is it. I have nothing else to say than what you have heard me say before; I wish I was not born. To my mom,",1

"Ok. So I am at that weird age where people are either dying mainly due to overdoses, accidents and occasionally suicide or they are getting married, settling down and starting families of their own. I look around at all my friends getting married and having kids and I think why cannot I be normal and want that? Instead my days consist of a tiring and constant uphill battle with depression. My friends are starting families and all I want to do is die because honestly I think that this world sucks. Then when I see that they are pregnant I cannot help but feel sorry for the unborn child. I think to myself who would ever bring an innocent child into this hell world? Although I know that is just the depression talking. All I do is work and then sleep so that I can escape from my own mind for awhile. There have been times where I have felt so awful that I have literally cried myself to sleep. And then sometimes I have to take Valium or Benadryl so that I will not dream because even sleep does not always bring me peace. I have actually thrown up a couple of times thinking about how I have to do this all for the rest of my life. What kind of life is that? I am afraid that I am eventually going to lose my battle with my mind and I do not want to hurt my friends and family but I also cannot go on living like this. My mind is constantly plagued by what is the meaning of all of this? Seriously I wonder who/what is considered normalthe people who welcome death because they know that life is virtually pointless and in the end nothing matters or the people settling down and starting families of their own? what is considered normal?",1
"I wholeheartedly believe I was born to fail. I was born to die. Why is it so fucking hard to try and make myself believe that is not true? Everything tells me that every time I keep trying bad shit happens and I end up more fucked than before. And now, if my car breaks down, and its a spotty ass car, I will have to move across the country back to Florida with My abusive family and no money or any of my things. If it comes to that, I have my answer! Why is it so hard to convince myself that some people were not born to make it",1
"I cannot help it but feel jealous about my other friends moving on in their lives. they are planning and packing and ready to further their studies overseas so so far away from our home country and I am mad. Mad that they do not have a care in the world that they are leaving their friends and family behind for a few years or maybe more if they stay back there to start working after uni. I am mad that it was so easy for them to make the decision to study overseas because they are mentally healthy and can make productive and positive changes in their lives with no trouble at all. I am mad that they are excited that things are going to change in their lives while I sit here wanting to die over every little thing that upsets me. I am mad that they have no financial troubles and can afford living and studying overseas for years when it was already hard for my parents to sustain my studies in my own country. I am mad that they are outgoing enough and will probably have a great new social life there and merge with the new cultures and dating life when dating has never been a serious thing among us friends in my home country before. I am jealous that they are confident enough in their own skin to do things they want to do. I can cry just thinking about all this. Jealousy, jealousy",0
"When quarantine hit, I lost alot of friends, nd did not really find my place between all the friends I had, felt like a side character. was friends with everyone, but not in the inside circle, yknow? I also had university stress, and family issues. I got over most of if, hell the past 2 days have been amazing considering 3 days ago I held a razor to my wrists. I said Ill get better, everything has been better, yet I still feel like I do not want to stay alive. Is it simply enough happiness is not enough? I have fun with friends, I am motivated to do shit now, yet I do not want to be alive. How can I get rid of this feeling? I thought If I got better it will go away, if happiness is not enough, then what is?? I cannot get over the feeling.",1
"I definitely do not want to live but I also do not have the courage to finally just commit suicide so I am just kind of here, suffering Limbo",1
I have had a lot of support from my family. Except from my bfs family and he himself does not want the baby. I have had a lot going on in my personal life where people have tried to tear me down and rip me apart. And its to the point where i feel like I am this horrible person who cannot do anything right. I feel like a disappointment to everyone including my baby. I do not want the baby to have a suicidal depressed mother like me. I want the baby to have a strong figure in its life. I am wanting to kill myself to the point where I have been planning it in my head. I want to do it after i give birth so my baby has a chance at life and can have a strong loving family and not a burden of a mother. I have gone through so much trauma and abuse to the point where I feel that my very existence was just to bring the baby into the world other than that I am not worth anything. Pregnant and wanting to kill myself,1
"To keep it short, last year in summer I graduated from my education. The time in school was easy to say pretty hectic, considering that I was suffering from massive headaches, anxiety and concentration problems. This could be reflected on my results in school, people would say that I was a lazy student and should work harder. I was very stressed out and, as opposed to the other students, I chose to spend my time differently after getting my diploma.This was a decision that I made in consultation with my parents. They took it very seriously and were very supportive and so I visited the doctor who figured I should see a neurologist. After a few appointments and a multidisciplinary research, they found out I was suffering from chronic migraine. At this point in time I was very happy to conclude that I was not crazy or anything, there was a serious reason to all of this pain I was suffering from for all these years.All of this time I spent most of my time in bed and playing videogames, because there was not really that much else I could do without overexerting my body. Playing videogames was like a nobrainer and it gave me the sensation of escaping from reality.Some more appointments followed up and I finally got a medication prescribed which could help me with the migraines. It was still not enough to get rid of the daily headaches so they gave me another medication called Candesartan... and luckily again, this reduced the pain by a big amount, but also the frequency of the migraine. I was feeling so much better now, but yet I was feeling that there was missing something.I was still very tired and bad at concentrating. Here is where I started to see a psychologist which referred me to a psychiatrist. This is where I get diagnosed with ADD, as of now I am still in the midst of getting medication for the ADD.Now the problem is, with all of these appointments a lot of time has passed. it is been a year now since the start of the sabbatical and I am still at home. I realise that I get a lot less joy from doing activities, but yet I know that this is temporary which makes me fight through this dark period for hopefully once and for all.In the beginning I did nothing else other than spending my free-time playing videogames when the migraine was very bad, but that was also partly because I was trying to avoid thinking about my area of expertise since I had a lot of anxiety of failure during my education and it gave me stress which I had never experienced before.Finally since a month or two ago, I finally started working again on hobby projects and realised that all of my knowledge had not left me behind. I was starting to feel more and more confident and until now I am developing a good portfolio for when I want a job. I am making a lot of progression on building websites and feel very confident, especially because my friends compliment me for my work.BUT please, this depressing feeling, please be temporary. I just really hope this is something that occurs when unemployed for some time. A friend of mine told me that this sure is the reason. Right in this moment I am on vacation with my family, but I feel like I cannot enjoy it to the fullest. Taking time off (a sabatical) to work on my problems made me indirectly pretty depressed",0
The only reason I do not is because i feel so bad about how my brother will be all alone and my father will be depressed.. I wish i could explain to them that i really want some peace of mind and death is the only way i will ever get that. I have wanted to end it for months,1
"I do not know why, but them removing the post twice has triggered a bit of a panic attack. no explanation. no rules that said i did anything wrong. just gone. anyway, here is the post. not doing great right now. &amp;#x200B;I pride myself on being a very blunt individual. As a result, I could probably count the number of times I have said ""I am doing good"" in the past little while and meant it on one hand. I have had to mitigate that because there are people I do not want to lose that are probably one (and I am exaggerating a bit here) ""Well, thanks for asking, but I kind of wish I had the strength to kill myself"" away from leaving for the sake of their own mental health. I can respect that, but I have learned to be afraid of being honest about how I feel.My SO is exhausted. he is hung on, but his family has not. they have all decided to distance themselves; not because of my mental illness, but because of the pain that the differences between him and I have caused. it is a long, complicated story, but we are trying to make it work. But there is no lonelier feeling than being cut out of someone is life because of something you cannot control. it is lonely because you are a victim to your mind. The only person in your way is yourself. You struggle against it and seek help but the severity of it makes it so impossibly hard. You try to improve, but that is not enough for some people. His parents claim they love me still but I know there is damage.My parents are exhausted. There have been times that Mom's ended up in the ER, thinking something was horribly wrong, but it was just stress-induced panic caused by her worrying about me. The guilt is insurmountable. They love me and say it is not my fault but still, I feel responsible. I think I *am* responsible.I am exhausted. This past month I have had depression unlike anything I have dealt with before. I was given a new diagnosis: major depressive disorder. A hallmark of that is frequent suicidal ideation. I have OCD. I have made many a post to [r/OCD]( talking about it. it is existential in nature, and therefore horrifying. I have described it as something like, ""you are so terrified of something being true that you might as well be having a psychotic meltdown."" Something like a suicide attempt where I tried to asphyxiate myself happened a few years ago after a severe case of bad thoughts. I am 23 and jobless; that is another rift between me and my SO. After all, he needs someone who can support him as much as I do. I have goals right now to fix that. I have got all this shit happening next week. A phone call with a lady who specializes in helping fucked up people land a job. Therapy starting up again. A recent med change. A few other things I do not remember right at this second.Thanks for listening. Going to pet the cats now. Maybe play with the dog. Tried posting this on r/vent. they did not care for it much.",1
"Hi folks.I am 31 and have had depression since I was 16, tried different antidepressants and currently on one. there is nothing really wrong in my life, I have trauma but does not everyone. I am just so sad and tired like mentally and sometimes physically it is hard to get myself to do anything but I still do stuff, I think I could be called high functioning even though my depression has been moving from mediocre to severe. Sorry if this does not make sense, English is not my first language. I have good days/hours/minutes but after the good moment passes this emptiness and heaviness comes and it feels like it consumes me. I am looking for a therapist but that seems too much sometimes. Most are also too busy to take on new clients.What else is there other than this, this depressed life where I either feel so depressed or wonder if I am just making it up. How do I get out of my head and into my life. How do I do anything like see a friend without dreading it at first because after hanging out, even if I had a great time, I will most likely get sad and beat myself up, ""I am stupid, I did x and that was bad"". I am someone else around a friend and I do not know if I want to be that person 24/7 or never. I wish I had friends I liked always, I do not want to sometimes hate them but sometimes I do. I would never tell them because it is not like they did something horrinly wrong. Most times my hate stems from the friend just saying something that I did not like. And I never tell them that. Just in my head I go I do not want to be friends anymore. But irl I just keep the convo going, smiling, acting like nothing.Everything is like a chore. I just want to enjoy life and be content. I feel so alone and so suffocated. I just wanted to let this out. Will I ever not have depression?",0

Thing is, I am nowhere near as concerned about what will happen to me as I am about what will happen to my loved ones. My parents will be scarred for the rest of their lives, my siblings will be left without their brother, and my friends will never see me again. I love these people to death, but unfortunately, that love is not enough to make me want to stay in this living hell. I wish I did not have to hurt anyone to set myself free. I with I could make them forget I ever existed. If it was just me, I could easily end it all. But I cannot bring myself to hurt anyone else that badly.I wish someone would help me. Why is it so unrelenting?",0
"I have bipolar depression and anxiety and that makes it really hard to determine whether my relationships are really meaningful or if they are of convenience.My older sister will buy me alcohol, and I used to think that was pretty cool to be able to drink with my friends. That was until that was the main reason my so called friends want to hang out. And because my family is so carefree about it, my house is always the place to go to hang out and/or get wasted. I have dropped anything/everything that was going on with me to get friends out of bad situations. Picking them up when they are stranded or had a bad day, giving rides home when they are wasted, getting them alcohol, and even waiting for hours in my car while they went to a party so I could sober drive them afterwards. Ill constantly get the I love you, I appreciate you, you are my best friend, etc., and I have even gotten the I am a terrible friend I am sorry multiple times, but I am just so sick of it.I cannot trust my gut instinct that they are just using me because of my mental health and I fear that I may be creating problems or just overthinking and spiraling. I have a problem setting boundaries and being too willing to help a friend in need, and I find myself putting other people too often, and I just wish I was not being put in those situations anymore. I feel sad just thinking about it, and I do not want to have a conversation about this and make my friends feel bad, but at this point I just do not know what to do. Am I allowed to be feeling a little unappreciated? I feel like all of my friends are only friends when they need something",0

"My consciousness has a finite and limited span of existence. If I am careful and lucky I have approximately 18,000 days left. That said, my cognitive abilities will start declining, if I am lucky, within 9,000 days. Saying nothing of my other faculties. I spend the majority of that time sleeping, ""working"" for money, resting, and in pursuit of my appetites.The way my imagination works does not lend itself well to words nor drawings and I do not currently have great skills with either. I cannot transfer information to others quickly or easily. Even if I am careful in how I express my thoughts, I cannot control for noise and bias in those who receive it. If I were to try to implement many of my ideas into reality it would take a substantial commitment of my time with a risk of no return. Not to mention the physical and mental impact such a task requires. Much easier to spend my time feeding my appetites and seeking distraction.I am a prisoner of time and space.

Like there is no reason to ask for help because I should not need it in the first place. And yet I move through life without meaning and a fabricated purpose. I feel unseen and like I do not deserve to be seen because I have not suffered enough and my low sense of self is unworthy self-loathing. Why speak up about feelings I should not have?

"To put some context I have been though some things in my life that I will probably explain in another post, just a little summary, when I was kid I was nearly raped by my cousin, I never told to my family, I grew up with some anxiety, my parents were a bit strict with me like physically harm me and saying things like I am stupid and that kind of things when I was a child, (I now understand why and that is because my mother also had some mental issues that now she cured and we have a good relationship), I think when I was like 10 I started thinking on suicide when I was sad, and at some time when I was 13 to 15 yo I started self harming me to mitigate those thoughts, I left it when I was 16 but sometimes the suicide thought came to my mind. I studied college and I still had that thoughts, I started dating a girl when I was 20 and everything okay but when whenever we got a fight the same thoughts just appeared. Now I am 25, I will be moving to another country because I will start my graduate studies, I still have my girlfriend but I still have suicide thoughts. My family and I are in good terms and we are close but I still think about suicide when I am sad. it is like my mind just imagines a place where I am happy, where I do not feel like these like another live and my mind it is like oh yeah If we suicide we can probably get there!. Despite of the fact that I am actually happy with whatever I am doing, I feel a lot of pressure but I think I am happy but I still get these times that I think on suicide. Once I tried to get some help with a psychiatrist and on the first session he wanted me to take lithium and I was like no wtf, lithium causes so much harm and that is something that psychiatrist used to give a lot to patients. I just wanted to vent my situation, any good advice or just a comment is well recieved, I hope you all good. Whenever I am sad I think of suicide",1
"When you are suffering from depression, everyone likes to give advice. Depression is not a brand new thing for me. I have had highs and lows and dealt with it in multiple situations over a period of YEARS. Yes, I have heard of therapy and have am participating in it. Yes, I have tried numerous other methods in the past and currently to try to ease it. What I am not looking for is random advice. I am closed to feedback. Friends and family think they ""know you"" and therefore have some kind of basis for giving advice. However, if you got cancer, they would not be so quick to advise you on a treatment plan, since they have not dealt with it themselves or when they do not have any medical training in the matter.Then why do they feel so free to give me advice for managing my depression? If you have not personally dealt with depression YOURSELF and can speak from your own lived experience, or possibly if you are a very empathetic person who has intimately dealt with this issue with a partner or friend, I AM NOT ACCEPTING ANY FEEDBACK.If I share my emotions, I am simply sharing. I am not asking for someone is ideas on how to ""fix"" said ""problem"". Since I have established this boundary, it is helped a lot. You get a sense of power which is hard to come by with depression. Hope this helps. Boundaries that have really helped me",0

"Told a very close friend of 4years that i had been depressed for a while now and spoke about my ongoing problems with self harm a few weeks ago. They then proceeded to call me stupid, that idk what I am doing and that I am just being an idiot overreacting on things. They also said that i will have worse problems in the future so i should not be depressed or self harm now. Ik they were trying to comfort me and tough love me but it still felt like they did not really care as they have never talked to me since and when i have tried to mention something they then said it was a lot for them to deal with and did not want to deal with it. Again i understand this, it is very difficult to say to someone that you self harm and expect them to know how to handle it but now i feel like a burden speaking my issues with them. Maybe i am selfish for expecting them to be there to talk to, i do not know, i just would have thought they would have at least checked up on me as i do with them and as how i am happy to help them and be there for a talk when they need one and because i have helped them.

"It was not until a few months ago that the thought manifested itself as a constant fantasy of killing myself, and yet the idea has always been there, its not as new as I thought. I have never wanted to live past the age of 27. Everything used to be simpler thoughts: I want to die in some tragic accident while I am still young, maybe a car accident, or hell, maybe a malfunctioned parachute or something crazy like that. Even when I was small, even when I was in elementary school, there was that idea: Ill accomplish the few things I hope for then leave. But now as years have passed, I have realized many things I desired as a small child are impossible. Maybe that is where the suicidal thoughts came in. The combo of always wanting to die, and the accomplishments being a moot point. I have gone from wishing some tragic accident would take me to thinking about exactly how Id purposefully leave this world- clearly taken by my own hand. Idk, its just all kind of haunting me right now, the realization that, tho in different form, the thoughts have always been there. I just realized I have ALWAYS wanted to die",1
"I got prescribed to months worth of Lexapro (and to take half a tablet a day) right before my insurance expired (they were trying to get me enough lexapro to last me until I find new insurance). That was two months ago and I have been afraid of taking it since.I smoke weed on the daily because it helps calm my nerves for like 30 minutes so I could work on my writing and get in the zone. However, in the past week I have been incredibly depressed and the upcoming death of my cat I fear will make that 10x worse (it already is).Is it worth taking Lexapro or do you think it will kill my creativity? I can be creative without weed, its just a small jumpstart. I am more scared of losing it to the lexapro but I am also scared of my lack of motivation, energy, and depression. I am trying to work on changing my lifestyle but its been years, and though I had a good 3-week period w/o depression after getting the pills (aka I did not have any anymore) I was back to square one and its been getting worse since. Lexapro - is it worth it?",0
"I have decided that it is time I get professional help for my suicidal ideation. Where do I go? I need a place I can go to tomorrow morning, I do not want an appointment that will not happen for days or weeks. I need to walk in to wherever and get some kind of help. I am making myself get in the car and go wherever it is to get help because if I do not now, I never will.What kind of place or person do I go to? For reference I am in the US. Where do I go to get help?",1
I was recently diagnosed with gallstones and had my gallbladder removed. However there were some complications and now there are stones stuck in the duct.The 7 months of time between noticing symptoms and the surgery i lost 60 pounds as I have been having a lot of trouble eating. Eating used to be one of the few thing that brought me joy now if i even try to snack ill feel intense nausea for hours. Even worse is the fact I am scared to leave my house because I know I am going to end up feeling sick no matter what. It really sucks when people ask me hangout and my excuse is always I am not feeling well. Feeling sick all the time has made me so much more depressed,0
Lately I have been in a really sad head space where I am really starting to get numb to alot of things that hurt me I am just going through a really tough time and its scary because I feel like I am losing it I googled what depression is and it seem that I have that but mental health is over looked in the african American families I have told several people that I feel depressed and basically its strugged off or they tell to go pray about it its getting to the point where its scary to where I am having suicidal thoughts I am literally suffering alone I have no friends to talk it out with my family barely speak I am in a unhealthy relationship of 16 years 3 kids with no way out Lost,0

"I think I have been depressed for years but nothing compares to how I have been feeling the past few months. I have only ever thought about dying in the past but now I see things and go to places and gather a mental list of how I could actually do it. Its messed up but I even hope that some kind of illness does the job for me or getting into an accident. I have thought about it so much that I did not even react when I almost got in a car accident today. Everyone else in the car got a fright and screamed but I was just disappointed. How fucked up is that? I did not feel scared, I just wanted it to end. And I used to think to myself if I am going to live then Ill give it my everything then I would go and get straight As and workout daily to try to pull myself together. I do not know what is changed but that mindset does not work anymore. I feel helpless and I do not want to talk to anyone about it because I know that no matter what they say it will not help me feel better. Then they will either get annoyed or bored because I am a shitty person. I am so numb",1
"Once upon a time there were a happy male. Needless to say there is nothing left of him anymore. I can barely remember the last 4 year of my life. At all. Some few memories though. I can barely remember the last 4 year of my life. At all. Some few memories though. I have been in an abusive relationship for the past 6 years. 6 months ago I broke free. It was hard. However the reason I managed to actually break free were due to the fact that I got into drugs. About 4 years ago I started to isolate myself from my friends. I did not even recognise it myself. I thought it were because I had a lot of things going on in my life but today I see the pattern. My abusive ex wanted that to happen. Roughly 3 years ago we moved in together and that is when the abuse skyrocketed. Both physical and mental abuse. Almost daily. I lost all my friends. Lost my family. Everything. Not that my family and I actually had a good relation before but if it were ok then, it absolutely went to the bottom. The only person I have had any contact with at all the last 3 years is in fact my abusive ex. it is sick. I know. However I did not really realize how bad it was while I were in all the constant drama, I think my brain were too busy to defend myself from all the physical/mental abuse. Fight/flight mode all the time. that is where the drugs really helped me out. Once I got down from that I could clearly see how sick my situation were. Finally roughly 6 months ago I broke free. Needless to say it is been hell. I do believe I suffer from some sort of PTSD now and it is literally killing me slowly. So much so that I am done. I am ending it today. I can barely socialise at all due to this. My brain will not allow me to relax in any situation regarding another human being. Hyper-vigilant all the time. Completely emotional numb. People even make fun of me calling me Mr.Robot. I tried to seek help, but were sent off. I tried to seek help from friends, no-one reaches out. I tried to seek help from family, no-one cares. I guess they are doing right. Their lives will continue just like normal in a matter of time. Think I will do it today..",1

"He sits aloneIn darkness, he swellsNo place like home.His eyes are wetHis lips are crookedNo need to fret.Mental paintings which hungNow lay, dust covered.Words which used to flow like waterHave now dried. he is tired.

These words mean nothing.He thinks to himself.They do not help.They do not soothe.So hell retire from his ink stained desk.And ask what is my worth?

"I (44/M) had depression and anxiety issues when I was 22 years old. I had been put on Paxil for 5 years and then I quit.I feel good most of the time but I still have panick attacks on occasion. I have a hard time getting the necessary motivation to complete tasks (I started over 20 new IT projects and completed none of them). I get new passions every months and I quit them as fast as they came.Because of arythmia problems I had to quit coffee 4 years ago (I was a heavy drinker).Every now and then I allow myself a cup of coffee.Right after drinking it, I feel soooooo good!! My mind is clear, I am so motivated by everything: calling friends to hang out, starting a new programming projects or completing existing ones, playing sports, reading a book, cleaning the AC unit, etc. Suddenly my day is wonderful and I do not want the ""buzz"" to end.I feel like some people are in this state of mind all day long.Therapy does not bring me into this state. I feel like it is biological.I am not depressed per se but I would feel much better if I could be in this state all the time.Is it more like a drug effect or do you think that I could reach this state of mind for a long period of time (either by taking prescription drugs or by any other mean)? I would like to feel like that all the time",0
Just a doubt.. what is the most painless way to die,1
"I have been depressed for many years. I have experienced failure, heartbreak, rejection, insecurity... I do not know how to love myself anymore. I am 29 and still live with my parents because I got my degree in psychology, which does not offer much for me right now. I work two jobs to make ends meet. I try to continue my education, when I can afford it. I volunteer with the Red Cross, when I am not smothered by work. I have lost hope in love. I have lost interest in things I used to love. Art, music, everything. I was sexually assaulted several years ago and lost my virginity as a result. I was assaulted again by a person I thought was my friend a month later because I confided in them and let my guard down. My only true relationship lasted a year and a half, and I realized only recently that I was a rebound from a bad marriage. He bought an expensive car after I lost my job and dumped me the next day. Our relationship was nothing but him gaslighting and manipulating me. Even when my grandmother was dying, he was barely supportive.Since, I have been in a terrible depression. I have worked constantly to keep myself distracted. I have pushed myself for better things. I have worked on my self esteem. I have lost the weight I gained during my relationship. I have tried getting back into the dating game. People tell me regularly how attractive I am and yet the only guys interested in me are desparate or just lonely. I am on the edge. And I do not know if I am ready or not.",1
I am GOING TO DO IT. I cannot LIVE LIKE THIS PLEASE MAKE IT STOOOP!,1
"I have suspected I had ADHD since I was around 11 or 12. Never spoke up, just tried to live with it. Self harmed during middle and high school, before tapering off during college. Finally saw a psychiatrist and got diagnosed at 25. Meds help a little, but my skills are terribly broken. I struggle with everything from time management, object permanence, impulse control, planning. My daily struggle is spent procrastinating on taking my meds, being productive for a few hours, starving myself because I cannot find the will power to get up and cook when I am hungry, beating myself up mentally for wasting a whole day again, and promising myself that the next day wikl be better. Eating is a chore because I hate sitting down to plan, but grocery shopping without a plan is tough, and deciding what to cook on a whim every single day from my limited and random ingredients is a chore. And that is before I mention that I have no dishwasher so dishes are constantly piling up. I do not think I am depressed. I would love to give life a chance. I would love to find the right meds, and therapy that helps me live up to my potential. I know it is possible, because I have many friends with ADHD who have gotten their symptoms tamed enough that they are all living productive and meaningful lives. Yet, I feel so behind because they all got diagnosed in grade school, and have at least a decade of treatment that I do not. I do not feel like I can wait 10 years. I am impatient. I want results now. I have struggled for so long, that I cannot accept the fact that I have to keep struggling even though I am in treatment. I know I should just put up with the pain I am in, and trudge through my difficulties, but I keep seeing suicide as a get well quick scheme. I know it is not a great idea, and I really do not want to cut my life short, but I also hate having to struggle every single day of my existence. I have never known a day of peace, so I keep thinking about how nice it would be if I never had to deal with ADHD again. I wish I had more options beyond living the struggle, or giving up the fight. ADHD makes my life unbearable",1
I mean yes and no depending on the circumstances. Say if you are stressed about life and have some sort of hope left yes but for people who are too far gone extremely depressed then no and usually just makes you more depressed or suicidal. I rang a crisis line a few days ago and they put me on hold so I just overdosed and was taken to hospital. Why put people who are depressed on hold? Very strange. Oh well that is what its like in my country if you are want help from a help line. Help lines do not really help do they.,1

"I will try to keep it short, I have got selected to a top Bschool in my country and after 1 month of attending classes I realized that again I made the same mistake in choosing my career which lead me to depression, I choose financial security over what I like doing. Earlier I sacrificed my career for that my family will benefit if i get a well paying job and me being good at academics I was able to crack the most difficult exams too but then later I realized I am not happy and I do see my self doing this work all my life or even a major chunk of time like 10 years. Now again I am stuck in a really lucrative and secure option but since my mental health is not good because I am not able to see myself happy even after I end up with a good job. I am just becoming a loser again and if i decide to dropout and do what I like doing .i.e. startup, but I fear that if it fails then I will not be able to bounce back at age of 26(yes I am 26 now and I am from South Asia) and I will end up as a failure and loser which I never was, I miss my 15 year old self who was passionate and driven and absolutely acing in everything but now I am a big failure story. So I want to see how guys see this problem from your perspective because I cannot think through and I do not want to trouble my family anymore. So what should I choose, security or what i love doing? My age is my biggest concern because things in my country are very different. Need help with a life changing decision",0
"I want to talk to someone about it, but I am not diagnosed.

Should I see someone in the 4 weeks I have or is it a waste? I will not be able to go to therapy until probably the end of October, at least. But I THINK I may have depression",0
"First of all I am not the best Englisch writing Person and a little bit drunk. I grow up with my mom and dad til the divorce MY DAD: was an ex robber / drug dealer and abusive men he was always in the mood to fight somebody and break them something also he was abusive to my mother. My mother on the other side was and is an depressive alcoholic and drinks every night till she is at least tippsy of drunk.She screamed at me when I was a kid til I was 15 or 16, like every day since I was in school, but never was abussive in a physically way besides she throw something at me sometimes. When she yelled at me it was not that normal yell what a parent does when you did something stupid it was pure evil hatred anger in her voice and when I started crying as a result she often said oh you going to cry again or I have you do not stop crying i Drag you on the hairs to the school tomorrow one day she said why do I have to be the one with such a stupid son but she sad it in such a way That I felt just cold I do not even know how I should have respondet to that.Also I have a unprocessed trauma because After the divorce I had to stay by my father every second weekend.And after one time I had to picked up in the first night as my mother came she saw the whole desk was full of drugs and after that night I couldt sleep alone and cryied every night i did not want to eat and did not want to draw ( I really liked to draw before). Til this day I do not know what Happend this night. ( could be normal abuse because I know when he hit me did not happed often maybe one or two times) School was also awfull because I was bullied for over 4 years straight and never had the streight to fight back, because I know when I got home my mother would be angry at me to for no reason. It was bullied with abuse from not only my classmates but also from other classes people to. Then I got a really bad lung disease and almost died and I was ready to die at this Point. But I managed to survive it couldt walk after that because all my muscles were gone and had to learn how to walk again and I am really thankful for that I am managed to survive it but there are days were I wish I had died at this point even said it a few times out loud when the pressure is to high in certain situations. There were many things that are to intim to tell or I have forgotten about but I do not want you guys to have to read to much. Today.

"You know what kind of movies and shows I am talking about. Stand By Me, Stranger Things, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Breakfast Club, etc. Plots about a group of close friends getting into hijinks together with a romantic subplot where one or many of them like the same girl (or guy). I know life does not play out like a movie but the essence of these films: the friendship, the heartbreak, the bonding, the etc, I never had that.The closest thing I have ever had to real friends was in elementary school but that is it. From middle school all the way to now, a college graduate, I was alone. I was not bullied really at all, thankfully, but I never had friends of any kind and just kept to myself. And it was all for really one main reason, if I had to give one: I was afraid. All the time I was afraid, and still am really at my core. I never really asked anyone to be my friend or if I could hang out with others. I would go in to school every day, sit in class, sit alone at lunch, then go home and do it all again the next day. The internet was my world that occupied my boring life and still does.Of course this also meant I failed at something else: girls. I have yet to even kiss a girl. Big accomplishment, I know /s. Again, I was always too afraid to even ask out anyone. The only time I ever really mustered up the courage was around prom when I asked one of the prettiest girls in my class and of course she rejected me (gently though, thankfully).College was not much better either. Sure I had my independence away from my parents. But what really did me in was laziness. I hated a lot of my classes and skipped regularly, which resulted in declining grades. Somehow though I got my degree five years later (switched my major too late) and here I am telling you my pity party story.Go ahead and make fun all you want. I stopped caring about life a long time ago. And now I am also mourning the loss of a close family member, my uncle, on top of everything else in my life. But going all the way back to the beginning, when I watch these shows and movies, the thing I am constantly reminding myself of involuntarily is ""I never had that"" and continuously put myself down like always. I do not plan on ending myself anytime soon. But the weight of my laundry list of regrets is a heavy load I still carry with me every single day. And one day it is going to break me if it has not already. I hate but also like coming-of-age stories even though I have spent the majority of my life alone and without any friends. And I want to talk about that",0
"I really should sleep I have work in a few hours but half of me just feels like quitting. I do not want to say I am feeling suicidal but if I could just not wake up again i would. I do not feel rational at all and i recognize that but it does not help. I am overly concerned with everyone is opinion of me and it sounds insane because actual strangers not seeming happy enough at work or not getting a response on something i post just overwhelms me. I feel like a child again. I did not get the place I wanted to move into and it feels so personal. I know its not really? But it does not help, I have this underlying feeling my roommates hate me and my room will be the worst and Ill get there and hate it all. Its not even two months now I am moving 6 hours away and I do not even want to.Nothing really makes me happy anymore I just want the pain to stop. This is what happened last time I just could not deal with it. I do not know what is wrong with me but I am not even sure I care to treat it. I think I just want to sleep and never wake to deal with it all. Genuinely I think what is stopping me is the fear failure like god if I failed and had to face everyone after that I could not deal with it.I am wide awake and i wish i was not. i do not want to get graphic but i did a number on my leg and i cannot even feel it anymore i cannot feel anything and i know its just in my head i mean i do not know I am too tired to do anything but i cannot calm down enough to sleep.

Some days I can swallow the feeling and pretend I feel normal but moments like this when I cannot sleep at 3am and I am on my porch while my boyfriend and our kids are in our bed I find myself sneaking out for a cigarette and a cry. I do not know how much longer I can hold out. I have left my country so many times on search of happiness but no place brings it.

I asked for help, and help I received. Most of my friends know, it takes a long time for me to trust people. My mother left me, came back, left, came back and basically destroyed my view of a family. I lost my therapist recently, I feel so abandoned... So I got to thinking, I have been trying for 3 years to get better and stop attempting suicide. Everyone knows the saying, 'How many psychologists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one, but the lightbulb has to *want to change.'* I think I am preventing myself from getting better. I feel like nothing has changed. I still go to sleep praying I never wake up. I still cry myself to sleep trying to manage my spiraling emotions. But, at least I stopped cutting myself every night. Or seeing how many pills I can fit into my mouth like its a fucking challenge. I am trying!I am stuck in a rut and I am running back and fourth. I want to fucking ***die***. I want to die!I wish I had the guts to try it again, knowing I am probably going to live. I want to die...People do not trust me. People do not love me. People do not care. I was so fucking sad and felt so abandoned, I tried to kill myself. Who cared? My mom, dad, and uncle. that is it. Maybe if I died I would be better off. Thanks for reading.

Seriously. Everything I do has no meaning and no rhyme nor reason. Gods used as a coping mechanism by those who need it but I just cannot bring myself to believe that I was made solely to serve something/someone else. So if all of my life is just some fluke or happenstance why the fuck am I here. I give nothing of value I am completely replaceable there have been and will be thousands more exactly like me so why? what is the point of trying to accomplish something when nothing at all matters.I just do not get it what is the point,1
I am 4'7 and I am 15 i think thays because of my poor diet and sleep schedule cuz i have been depressed since 13 or because ny mom was really short I am taller than my mom but idk why I am.so short I am so ugly and inhatw my bodybgod hated me inthink I am 15 and I am going to die,1
"I think I am finally done with life. By all measurable counts of success, I failed at life. I am not attractive, rich, funny, never had a girlfriend at the age of 23. I cannot find a job in my field. People always bullied me since I was a kid so I did not really have too many reliable friends and the ones I did end up either backstabbing me or moving away. I am just tired of life and everything. The only person that would miss me really badly i believe is my mom but at this point i stopped caring about how she felt. I think I am going to do it by falling off a large building because i do not really have means to anything else and this seems the most painless. August 30th is the day I chose",1
"Today I just realized how much of a monster I have become. My vacuum cleaner went bust and my BF and I were looking at options. I was torn between 2 models. I wanted the more expensive one because it had all the functions I every wanted but not needed. The cheaper one was just what we always had. We got the cheaper one, and I was really disappointed. Of course I helped paid for it.We then discussed household improvements. Replacing broken aircon units, installing ceiling fans to reduce aircon use. Replacing a deteriorating refrigerator. Many other little things and big things. All, in my mind, pretty important stuff. Some necessary, some quality of life changes. But We cannot afford it.I am crushed. Despite saving for several years, I do not even have enough for my meds. I have been getting bare minimum wage for a job I have worked 7 years for with no raise in sight. People in my position usually get at least 70% more than what I am earning, but here I am, earning less than a fresh graduate joining their first job. despite more experience, despite more responsibilities.I asked if our parents would help even a little. Maybe help us get a good contractor they trust, maybe a little financial help. I got shot down. Specially by my own family.that is when it hit me. I have become an entitled monster. I want things, and I wanted people to pay for it and give it to me like I deserved it. I wanted to demand a pay raise even though I probably do not deserve it. I keep wanting more than what I can afford, spending above my means, expect people to do it for me just so I can be happy. I have turned into a monster. Like all those entitled Karen out there that think the world owes them. I am now one of them, I was probably always one of them.No wonder my mother called me an entitled spoilt brat that is useless. That I am a waste of space and should not have been born. No wonder that old boss screamed at that its all my fault, that I am useless and always wrong. They both say I will never be entitled to anything. I will always be the scum of the earth. I am disgusting, a disappointment, a monster. And they knew it. And now I know it.I am pampered and spoilt for wanting people to help pay for what I want. I do not deserve a pay raise because I am not good enough and will never be good enough no matter how hard or how much I try and do. They know I am a monster, and monsters do not deserve anything. I am useless, hopeless, waste of space and everything is always my fault.I do not want to live anymore. Everyone will be happier without me. And there will be one less monster in the world.I am going to OD myself with every single med I have when everyone goes out.You will not have to deal with a monster anymore. They were right all along.Good bye. I am a monster",0
"I do not care about anything anymore. I do not want to actually harm myself just yet, but I actually pray that I would have an incurable disease or suffer a stroke that ends it all. Had one a small one a few years ago due to high blood pressure (232 over 147) even though I am only 40. Work is a never ending disaster. People calling off. People not following work instructions. Inability to buy standard equipment because our other sites are losing money. The kids always need something. Daddy this and daddy that. She will not share. Can I have a snack? I have lost my few friends that I had over the years due to family and work commitments. Found out I did not get my dream job today that I interviewed for with a company that I have been looking at for several years. The icing on the cake is my wife who has been on a personal vacation (while I have had to cancel my own personal golfing appointment several times because she has other plans) to visit friends in another state flat out refused to talk to me on the phone today because she did not to be rude to her friends. She has not called me to talk once in the 4 days she has been gone. Because she was busy. So here I sit in my garage. Alone like always. Chain smoking and drinking vodka and Red Bull. Debating about going off my blood pressure meds because I just cannot take all of the crap anymore. that is all life is. Crap compounded on more crap. And when the one person you think you can depend on leaves you high and dry when you ask for help you wonder why am I doing this. You feel black and dead inside all the time and just want to be done. I have tried counseling but I just feel like crap on the drive home knowing that no one is going to listen to me again until I see that person who I have to pay to listen to me because I have no one else that will. At the End of my Rope in Every Possible Way!",1
"If I go put with people I cannot enjoy it because I feel like shit. If I do something, occupy myself with anything, my mind drifts off to to my shitty life. I cannot sleep, I just pace around my room all day and do nothing.I stg I do not want to live anymore. I do not want to think anymore",1
"I am getting to the point where I want to end my life , you can judge me all you want but you do not know how I been struggling all these years, not to mention covid made it worse. I am on autopilot. I am done it is a rap .Case closed and really wish people would just let me die you know it is like the people keep on calling the cops on me when I try to go the overpass which just leads the mental hospital so no help it is like I do not get it why cannot people just let the person take their own life , it is their life godammmit! Its none of your business nor none of your rights . I am frustrated socially distanced mother passed, sister in Virginia, fake step mom, fake everything nothing is good I want to die I am tired of living I been fighting my whole fuckingg!

I do not want to wake up , I want to be in a comaaaaa! I do not want to see the next day it is get worse by the minute What the point of living when nothing works out",1
"I am having problems to remember certain things, I do not know if it is because of meds, but just feels so wrong, and this sensation makes me think even more in just killing myself and ending my life. I cannot see myself having a life, even though I try so hard, all my efforts seems so useless. Should I end my life and stop this sensation? Because at this point I do not think the effort to keep going is worth it. Everything seems so blurry",1
"Hi everyone,Recently I have been feeling really bad again. I am trying to keep going but its so hard. I have this strange feeling, I just feel really low and anxious all the time. I feel awful, and I cannot stop thinking about all sorts of bad things that upset me or scare me. I do not know what I am supposed to do. Id probably drink but I have run out of alcohol and I do not want to leave home to get more. I do not know what to say to people about it without just worrying them. I just need to do something, to say something. I need to make this stop but I do not know what to do. Not doing good",1
"Forgive me for the vulgarity, I have had a little to drink.This monk bitch said ""When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.""I have been at my lowest point for an incalculable about of time.

Aang is a fucking liar",0
"I do not know how to start it out so I guess I am going to just be venting through this. I have always dealt with some level of depression since about middle school but now its seems to have grown to actual depression, I do not open up about it because I do not want to seem like one of those kids who get sad here and there and act all depressed so I keep it on the dl but as school is nearing its spiking back up because in middle school I was such a weirdo that no one liked me so that is what started it I guess, but now with 2 years in a row going by without school and friends because of COVID, I had gotten better socially but no one wants to hang out because of how I used to be and without school I did not have an opportunity to build new relationships, I am about to join Yubo and try and make new friends until than but this is only half the reason I am feeling depressed, my mother died when I was 13 and my grandmother just recently passed and one of my favorite rappers lil loaded just killed himself and I never really dealt with these losses I was in the mindset of keep it moving because the world goes on wether we like it or not but now I realize I have just been carrying the weight but its just now starting to get heavy it started with 20lbs than 15 with my grandma than 5 with my rappers, the weight suddenly doubled and I had been carrying it around everywhere I go. Its lead me down a path of feeling life has no purpose and now its a dark cloud over my head 24/7 I have not gotten any close relationships built because deep down I feel there is no point because its eventually going to end and I have been replacing these relationships with parasocial relationships from tv shows and YouTube but you have to wait a year before you see them again so it makes it a bit worse having to wait, I am planning on asking my dad to take me to grief therapy because I believe that is where it all stems from and my inability to connect with others. My goal right now is to deal with my losses in therapy and start building meaningful relationships instead of ones with tv characters. I have been trying to stop over thinking because I have minor ocd and when I think of something negative it will not stop until something switches my momentum or until I go to sleep Sophomore in high school",0
I have been labelled as depressed but sometimes it feels like a bit of a blanket term because I see how many people go in for treatment of depression/anxiety and later find they actually have a personality disorder. I am not a person who does not believe in depression but I am highly suspicious despite all the people who have told me I am depressed. How did you know you were depressed instead of having a personality disorder?,0
"I have no one to really talk to anymore. I mean yeah I have my friends online but they are not even on too much anymore. The girl I was talking just stopped out of no where. I keep trying to distance myself from her because I know Ill get hurt the more I talk to her. But then I always find myself giving in and I answer her calls. I am too awkward to meet new people, even online which is really pathetic. I want to meet new people but I always have a fear that they do not like me and they just talk to me so they do not hurt my feelings. I just wish I knew whether or not people actually like me for me and do not think I am a worthless piece of shit. I am starting to feel alone",0
"Is there a point to life? I find myself struggling to see past working 40+ hours a week, coming home exhausted, eating, showering, sleeping then repeating. There seems to be no other point to life then just work until you die. Oh stay for the little moments I am not staying for a 1% moment out of 100%. that is just fucking stupid. Sorry but I am not going to slave my life away to a cooperation for absolutely nothing in return. No thanks. Is there an actual point?",1
"um well so far my life has been pretty shit to say the least I grew up emotionally abused but a black household does not see it that way which sucks in all honesty I mean I have been thinking about suicide for 4 years and I cannot keep going on like this. I cannot talk to anyone in my family because of my crippling social anxiety, I have tried to get better with all this depressing sad shit and it has not worked one bit I have done up to everything suggested and things I have thought of myself and none of it has worked I have only felt good for a few days then I went back spiraling into my emotions for along time I have hated the way life was and the way people behaved and acted towards each other and me. Sometimes I wake up with thoughts of hurting people or hurting myself daily and I would not even be able to speak to a family member about getting a therapist or psychiatrist because they do not believe in that one bit and I do not know what to do because I sometimes feel no emotional attachment towards my family I am not even 18 yet and my birthdays next month I in reality did not want to make it there because all I wanted was a family that I felt love from and to be loved (yes anti-climatic i know) but I have had very bad self doubt and it just gets worse I have hated my appearance and I have hated the way I have looked for years I have always felt ugly tried many things to feel better about my appearance but nothing works in all honesty (lol I know I am spewing random shit but this is the best I can do) I wanted to be happy for along time and I am still trying but I have given up hope after today. There was a girl that I cared about very much (skip the blah blah shit) we broke up and she told me she had feelings for my best friend after reassuring me that she did not like him (he liked her) they are now together :) and I am just stuck here in a horrible position I have wanted to kill myself for along time I just cannot find a way successfully Either today or the next few days I am going to end everything",1
i already have been told my whole life. at wotk i was even publically shamed about it and everyone now teases me because i cried. i activly hurt myself and my so in my life tells me are you done yet i need to sleep. so i just started taking a collage of picture of me to hng on my wall before i kill myself. so they can laugh at me eveeyday. accepting that I am ugly,0
"A couple months ago, I hurt one of my closest friends with words that I did not mean a single word of. I lashed out. But even so, that just makes me all the worse of a person that I let out my anger and frustrations upon my peers like that.I have alienated myself from the people that have actually made me happy in my joke of a life. And the moment I have been kicked out of some of my peers lives, things start to drastically improve for them. Its like I was hindering their happiness this whole time.The worst part of all of this is that I did this to myself. I am responsible for the way I am. Its my own fault that I am an asshole; a jerk; an absolute pathetic loser.A day does not go by without a passing thought about ending my own life. Forgiveness and redemption are futile at this point for me. I feel like I am better off not being in anyones life",1

I am making sure to appreciate this Independence Day as much as I can. I wonder if it will be my last. I love fireworks,1
i feel like i ruined everyone is lives. and now no one likes me. i feel like a failure. i feel like a lost because. i feel like a burden. i feel like jumping off a building. i feel like everyone has given up on me. and i feel as if everyone will be better off without me. rant i guess,1
"I cannot remember the last time I felt content with life. I am on two antidepressants just to get through the day, and it barely gets me up in the morning. Every disappointment/set back in life feels ten times as heavy when you are already at rock bottom. I do not feel joy in life, just small moments of laughter or jaded hope. I am really trying to come out of it all, but I just keep getting hit over and over and over again. It looks like Ill be losing my job today. To top it off, the manager talked to me with complete disgust on his face. I am so tired of feeling dehumanized. People say you can reach out and talk to them whenever, but they are never there. Even the people who mean well, do not fully understand. What they meant by, tell me your problems, is you telling them how much better you are doing, and then changing the topic and putting the focus on them. They do not actually give a shit about you and your legitimate problems, they just want to hear how great everything is while you are drowning. DO NOT mention if you are feeling suicidal, then they look at you like you are a crazed monster! It is selfish and I do not talk to those people anymore. Which has created an even lonelier existence, but at least I do not have people looking down on me for trying to survive. I like reading the posts here, because you guys truly understand the pain of it all. The only place I feel heard. let us keep trying our best, its all we can do. So tired",1

"Ever since I was about 13ish. I think its because I feel like I am being tauntedthat I should be outside enjoying life, with people. I prefer when its cloudy and rainingthunderstorms are even better. The irony is I thought I had SAD, especially in college. But nope just all year(life) long depression. Sunshine, especially in the summertime, makes me more depressed",0

I bought an expensive gym membership for me and my mom. They have a jacuzzi and large swimming pool. She will promise to go with me but whenever that day comes she always says she is tired...every single time. I think before the pandemic we have only been to the gym twice together altogether out of my 3 year membership. She will not go with me. I wish I had someone to go with but I do not :/. I have 0 friends. Guess I will go by myself. Going by myself is so awful. I see everyone else with their friend/partner and me... all alone.. I have went to the movies by myself too because she did not want to go. Someone even asked me in the movie theater what is a young girl (I am 21) like me doing alone :/ Wish I had someone to do things with :/,0
"Everything.Everything seems to be too much. Everything seems to be too late. Everything seems to be too evil. Everything seems to be too hopeless.I have an incredible boyfriend that I am planning on spending the rest of my life with. We just bought a house, plan on 3 kids, and I am soon getting on the long road for my dream job. I have a future, but I really wonder about a lot of things.Its painful to think about, but what is the point? The planet is dying. People are full of hate, and corruption and evil are business models. Its all so sick and depressing.I have been mentally ill my whole life. I have no business having children, especially as someone who is into environmentalism, even though its the one thing I have wanted to do since I was little. I want to be a mother and raise my children to be stronger than myself, to be the good in the world and live unapologetically and happily with all the love they could ever need or want. But it feels like the world is too far gone, physically and socially. I feel like bringing children into a world that is worse off than when I was born is horrible and selfish.My boyfriend has wanted to be a father his entire life, too. Were a perfect match and I was so blessed to find him. But if I ever decide that having children is not right after all, he would understandably leave (its a huge incompatibility in a relationship, so I would not blame him). But I cannot live without him. I would rather die than live without him.I have not been suicidal in almost a year. I do not even really know if I am right now. I just want to scream out into the world. I want things to change for the better. I want kindness to prevail and I want people to see the beauty of the world they live in. I want people to live happily and safely. Its all very much a pipedream, I know. I just do not know how much longer I can go on. I am too weak and pathetic and soft for this world, and I just do not know what to do.The stress I face right now (money, paying for college, my physical and mental health) wear so heavily on me. I am 5 days sober from alcohol and xanax, but damn, it really hurts. Maybe I am just exhausted and burning out. But everything is really just too much right now. I am scared and losing hope.",1
"I am curious how people would react. I do not think there is anyone who is better off with me around. I do not really think anyone cares about me, they might just be putting up with me. Will my classmates ask about where i went? Will they cry when they find out? Will they be shocked? How long will it take for my family to recover? If my experiment really shows that i will not be missed ill probably quietly go through with it properly I am considering staging my own suicide",1
I really want to die Kill me,1
I think I am probably going to go ahead and do it today. I am not sure in going to leave a note for my loved ones. I think all the ones who need to know how I feel. That it was not that there love was not enough. I am just not meant to be here I do not think. Just existing in a comfortable environment should not be this hard for someone. It is not for someone worth anything. Broken I think.,1
I (20m) have been abusing drugs for 3 yearsI did not do last Sem of uni I cannot hold down a regular job and had to move back to my grandparents like 4 times I have ruined 3 possibly good relationships due to my fucked up attachment issues I hate this... I do not want to live in this life.... I just got ghosted by the only person I knew who I was attached to but the last time we interacted she called me and ridiculed me and I did not even realise she was doing that and then yeah I realised I was blocked I have literally no one left accept my grandparents who I live with and I do not feel good about being around only them I do not feel like I am being socialised properly and they look old and it is scary and fuck idk. I am an utter piece of shit,0
"Seriously, this book is amazing. I learned so much about depression that I never knew before. This book would have made my recovery ten times easier if I had read it back when I was really sick.

"i know ill kill myself within the next school year. i could barely handle 8th grade since i was hurting my self everyday to cope. 9th grade was pandemic year, i was able to avoid a lot of my problems with online but it took a huge toll on me regardless. i will not make it as a sophomore. I am suffering already, i know school will push me to my breaking point this year.

"i have a horrible family that treats me like shit, i have no friends, i have no one to talk to anymore. exhausted is the perfect word for how i feel, like i cannot breathe anymore. it feels like a weight is on me at all times. i do not think i can go on for even another day like this. i have a bottle of pills here but i do not think i can do it. but i just want everything to stop. i want everyone to just stop. i want to be free of this hell I am in. i need so much help and no one listens to me. I am so exhausted of everything",1
"The thought to end my life constantly plays in the background of my mind. A part of me has made peace with the thought that that is probably going to be the way I die down the road; Ill get tired of fighting and finally just give in. Currently I live as an obligation to the people in my life that know me and care for me. A part of me knows that I should feel grateful to have people in my life that want me around, but I just feel guilt. I wish I cared about my life as much as they do. I feel bad for them for caring about me and getting attached. I just want to disappear I just want to disappear Tw: suicidal ideation",1
"It was in 2011-early 2013. I was feeling particularly empty that day for some reason. I felt sad, but the emotion felt distant. I was looking for the Sponge Bob episode ""A Flea in Her Dome"". I saw a low quality video of it and all of a sudden I started feeling down. I felt this weird nostalgic feeling, but not a good one. It was the feeling you get when your life goes by too fast despite the fact that I was only 9-11. I was crying uncontrollably all day long, but like I said my emotions felt distant. I was feeling a pain deep in my stomach and in the back of my throat. It felt like I had to forcefully exaggerate my expressions to force out the sadness. I honestly do not know how to explain it. I felt empty and like the emotions were distant and far off. I felt removed from myself. Idk how to explain this but I have felt empty inside since then and I am only 18M(almost 19).I am sorry if I explained this horribly I remember the last time I cried.",0
"We are not speaking for a month due to a break we are taking. Impossible for me to know whether we will stay together or not. In the meantime I am preparing myself for a breakup, even if I have some faith in the outcome. I have fought hard to reassure him about continuing together, but he is still lost about what decision to make. Beyond this I am afraid of a lifetime where I will never know if he is truly okay.Even if for a day it is easy to think he is not for me, I go to sleep crying because I feel the thought is cruel. He has been nothing but loving from the start and we were happy together. Our families liked each other. I love his so much. A few months ago I found out he has been suicidal for a long time. He told me his dark thoughts and it broke my heart. He did not want to talk about it and was upset that the whole thing came up, because it triggered him. We rarely ever fought, but now he says he cannot trust me. Now I pray to God for the first time so he gathers strength to overcome his depression because there is nothing else I can do.He continues to love me and want this relationship, but fears it might do him more harm than good. I want to do anything I can to prove I am strong enough for this and that I can be his support. I am afraid of what happens to him if he gives this up, which I understand is arrogant. There is no way to claim I am what he needs. But we thought we were going to be married one day. I am scared he is pushing me away. Viewed optimistically, the end of the relationship could diminish potential triggers and give him the space to focus 100% on himself, his way. All of my friends say I need to look out for myself right now. But what on Earth could my strength be for other than him, when he was the first to make life beautiful for me. Because of him I overcame my own depression and became so strong. I think I would be okay, I just would hate to settle for someone else. There is no knowing why he is depressed and what stops him from trusting me. Maybe he has some secret, I would suspect about gender. I would be with him no matter what. Anyone with advice, it is very welcome! I want to be there for him so badly, I am just not sure what else to do but be patient, I have done everything I can. I have cleared up misunderstandings. And again, maybe a breakup is just what makes sense. But this came out of nowhere. I trust he will find his way even if without me. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and he thinks he wants to split up.",1
"it is such bullshit how the symptoms of my old depression, which I thought I had moved past, can just appear, for no reason, at the worst time. I have no energy, I do not want to talk with anyone, I do not want to eat or drink, I do not want anything at all. I used to be really depressed a few years ago. I am mostly better now, but sometimes I still feel the way that I used to. Today is one of those days",0
"I am a tired RN. I rarely get to see my Grandkids because of a narcissist daughter in law. It has been over a year. I am sick with autoimmune. I now have double vision and cannot work. I hate sitting around doing nothing. My husband is working. We have a food, a place to live and vehicles to drive. I do not have a lot saved for retirement. I am tired of living. I would not do it because I know it is a selfish act and not fair to my husband and family. I just cannot get out of my funk. Waiting on MRI results to see if I have MS too. Sick of being sick. I do not have any good friends. My husband is my best friend. Sometimes I just want to go live if grid in the woods. Learn to live moment to moment. I am tired",1
"Life is all shitty thing after shitty thing. you study for a degree that you do not really care anymore bc the environment is so stressful for so little knowledge payoff that it just seems like ur wasting everyone is time, + the school fucks up ur schedule even if you try to stay at the top of ur game, even tho you feel like ur not learning anything useful, specifically to not have problems with that, and now you cannot even try to change classes even tho they are simply STILL HIRING the ppl who should have been teaching you since semester started weeks ago. And then you graduate to work in an ok career, will not get much, but at least I am going to be able to have a job, just to feel like you have not actually learned a dang thing which forces you to go BACK to that academic setting that makes you want to actually commit ever since you were in school being the butt of everyone is joke, while still trying to manage working because you have to get out of ur parents house as soon as possible to live in whatever shitty place you can get if you want to cut an inch off your hair. Even tho ur parents were living at your grandmas ur whole childhood and she did not give a shit what they did with their bodies, you do not get the same range because of, take a guess, fucking politics! That are not getting any better bc no matter what fucktards get in power you are still going to be discriminated against for the rest of your life on at least 3 dif bases and the people who fight for udont actually, they just want ur vote. you are probably going to be alone also because the person you love is also dying to go back to her home state, one of the less diverse regions in the country and wants to live moving places whereas with you that just sounds like a lot of planning and uncertainty and a lot of planning and uncertainty sounds like even more stress + mocing around w/ ur profession that is not that easy (but hey i got no ambition anyways so maybe that can be arranged). And it does not even matter bc there is no long run, the planet is literally fucjing dying! All and all, feels impossible to simply get over all of it and live normally Just feels impossible not to be depressed",0
"Depression, anxiety, bipolar, and trauma have governed every aspect of my life fo as long as I can remember. I have had multiple suicide attempts, rehab, every antidepressant known to man, and nothing has ever gotten better. I am currently on medical leave from my last suicide attempt. No one in my life knows, I just pretend to go to work everyday.But now I am finally at peace. I am going to see my all-time favorite band in NYC soon, see the sights, and go to restaurants I have been wanting to try for years. I will not be coming back. I have tried to end it before but this time its different; I feel at peace. I am able to go out on my terms while crossing stuff off my bucket list (rather than the usual abstaining because I am paralyzed by anxiety). This last month since I have made this decision has been the best in 9+ years. I am not sure why I am posting this other than to put something of myself out into the ether, I guess in a vain attempt to avoid being completely forgotten. Thank you all. I feel better for the first time in years because I finally know its ending.",0
"I have been feeling numb for so long, i feel like I have spent the past like 9 months walking around like a ghost. Just going through the motions and not really feeling anything. I used to cry just watching movies but for a while now I have not cried about real things until last night. I spent time with a coworker hanging out after work and I came to the realization that I have not been living. I am 20 years old and have a couple friends that I only see every once in a while because I hate leaving my house. I spend my days working or at the gym or laying in my bed. When I wake up the first thing on my mind is how can i get through the day fast enough so i can go back to bed. I feel lost and have no one to talk to. After hanging out with my coworker yesterday I sat in my car and cried for like an hour in the parking lot of a grocery store, and this morning at the gym I could not help but cry and I have been having tears coming out nonstop. When I was crying yesterday I wanted to talk to someone so bad but I could not, everyone sees me a strong person who can handle their emotions but I cannot and I am tired of pretending that i can. I just do not know what to do. All i want to do is lay under the covers and watch netflix but that is what I do all the time anyways. This is my first time sort of reaching out, I do not even let my thoughts form into real words because I am so afraid of there being something wrong with me. I want to be normal i want to be happy i want to be free and thrive and to love living life but i cannot keep on pretending. I tried pretending so that it feels real and so that i can convince myself that i am doing okay but I am not :( I cannot stop crying",0
...cannot be good for me. Most days I barely move my body at all. I have no hobbies and no duties or responsibilities. My muscles are surely atrophying slowly. There is no reason to get out of bed. Nothing sparks joy. Nothing matters. Nothing is important. The number of hours I lay motionless in bed...,0
"I am an Australian 16 year old. In my foreseeable future I have absolutely nothing to look forward to. I am on a prescription for fluoxetine which is an anti-depressant and has not affected how I have felt or thought ever since I started taking them. I am constantly on the verge of suicide with nothing to gain or nothing to lose. I take melatonin to sleep each night so if I wanted an easy way out I could easily overdose on the melatonin. I just need a reason to keep going, no goals in life, nothing pleases or makes me happy anymore. Give me a reason.",1
"they always say it as a reason not to kill myself. i almost got help tonight and tried to check in to a psychiatric hospital but it is too fucking expensive and i literally have like $40 in my bank acc. trying to get rid of the little things i have and then start over. it is extremely hard not leaving my house, my pets, and everybody else. the only thing stopping me is my survival instinct i literally could not give less of a shit about myself or anybody else in my life. I am an extremely young adult and I have been on my own for nearing a year now, i hate doing this. i think I will be homeless by the 28th when my rent is due i hate it when people say ""but you are so young!""",1

"me and my long distance girlfriend broke up and i do not know what I am going to do without her. we did not sat those exact words but we knew it was over and I am so worried that she might have taken her life because of this breakup. i was the only reason she had to keep going and if we had just stayed together i bet she would not have done anything (if she did) I am going to feel guilty for the rest of my life because of this if she is not still here. but not only that how am i supposed to move on? this month is going to hurt the worst. july 22nd is the day we first met and we would have known each other for a whole year. that is a long ass time. I am in so much pain that i do not know how I am going to carry on living if she is not here not only that but just the fact that we are not together anymore. our relationship was painful at times because we are both going through our own shit so obviously we were going to have problems. but i want to kill myself so bad now we were together for seven months and we spent so much time together. we had loads of inside jokes, made things for each other, played roblox together. the fact that we are never going to get to play roblox together again may be one of the saddest things all i can think about right now is how much she loved my avatar and would call it elfie and now i want to start sobbing i just want to die and hurt myself till i do i cannot fucking do this anymore",1

I gave it all. I just was not enough. Between depression and the intentional, slow distancing, everything is crumbling apart on my end... I can' do this.I want to do this... But... I feel so weak.

"Hello people, how are you?I am an university student and currently I am on my winter break. It lasts a month and its becoming tiring and really boring.As I said above, when I am free from any compromise like studying or anything else I feel sad. I become sad out of the blue, usually at night of course. I think of my life, of my friends and I usually get jealous of them (usually girls that i like hahah).However, I do not think my life is bad, it is just very plain and with no big things happening. It does not help that I live in a boring and small town in the middle of nowhere for now.My days are really boring because I do not have anything to do, I feel unproductive and I cannot focus on reading what I like. Nor practicing other things I like like languages or math. I am always listening to music (usually jazz, Frank Sinatra or old rock).In spite of this situation I go through every summer or winter break, I enjoy studying when I have to. It makes me feel I have a purpose to do what I am doing, even if I fail. It does not demotivate me, I kept on studying and trying. And I feel very happy and excited.Just that, It is not my purpose to seek any professional help nor I am desperate. It was just to share my experience, maybe as a relief for myself. I feel sad when I have nothing to do",0
I want so bad for something to go right. A happy life with friends and people who love me. Sometimes things are so unbelievably terrible that I start to wonder if religion is real and I died and went to hell. I think it would be something like being alone. I have not even seen a familiar face in over a month. Loneliness is killing me and nobody wants someone broken anymore. Things have so bad throughout my life that I am starting to wonder if I was a terrible person in my past life and this one is punishment. I do not even believe in past lives.,0
Is 20 young to die? Question,1
Car broke down so I was late for work. Had to she will out money I do not have. Work was awful and I am pretty sure I saw my ex across the street today. Got no one to vent to and today the world just really wants me to not exist. Does it ever get better? Terrible day,0
Everyone in my life always leaves me I never hold onto friendships and I am usually left to deal with everyone alone. At one point I got use to it and ok being alone but I had a relationship fail and It was mainly to do with her ex being closer to her and trying to get back with her then I was. I go to school and hang out with people but none of them know me and I do not have any actual friends. I talk to 1 person on a daily basis but I am too scared to admit that them because I do not want to be judged. The only time I have peace is when I am distracted but I have started thinking again about a bit more of permanent solution. I got out of suicidal thoughts and depression once but I am not sure I have it in me to do it again. I just want to give up and fade away. No one cares about me and I will not even be surprised if no one replies to this. I just do not see a point to life anymore,1
"I cannot keep going like this. I had a suicide attempt 1 year and a half ago and everyday I regret not going through with it. Now I have kidney failure and do not want to keep fighting for a life I do not even want. Me and my Ex are still on good terms. I know he does not love me anymore and has possibly moved on, but hes my best friend and I cannot let him go which hurts because I still love him the same amount as the day I realized if not more. He knows about my suicidal thoughts and my kidney failure but refuses to accept that I am on my last legs &amp; cannot continue like this. Hes usually there to prevent me from hurting myself or attempting because I reach out to him but this time I am not going to. My question is should I tell him or text him I love him one last time? If I do this I plan to block him immediately after. Or should I just leave it be and go without a word? Should I tell him?",1
Sort of the halfway of things. no intention of keeping anything. only the truly unexpected can rewrite. No immediate danger a late,1
"I am 30 years old, 13 yeas ago wen I was 17 years old I got sick, it got worse really quickly and 2 months after I entered the hospital I had to had operation to have an external heart support, 1 month later I went through a heart transplant. Since I recovered from the hospital I have had a severe depression. I became obsessed with death the more and more I read about transplants online, the mortality rate, life expectancy, etc, nobody even mentioned any of this to me before I got the transplant. In my country the person who has lived longer with a heart transplant it is been 21 years and is all can think about. I am not a good person and I have drank a lot in the last few years since it was the only thing that helped me forget about everything for some time, right now I just cannot do anything, I just cannot get out of the bed I cannot fake it anymore and smile like I everything is going to be okay. I do not want to go through a transplant again neither die in pain, I just want to die in peace, I wish I would have died in that bed before I took this heart from someone else, it could have been of better use. I just do not understand why in the 21 century we do not allow people to help them die how they want. If I were not a coward I would jump out of the window right now. I just cannot take it anymore",0
"I just do not know what I feel anymore. I feel like a ghost, just going through all the motions in life. it is weird, I know. This is not what I normally go through during a episode. I just feel very stupid, ""out of it."" Like..an earth worm. Just doing the things to keep being alive. Eating, sleeping. I am being very careless and stupid. Driving idiotically, just being aloof and out of body. Tried to hook up with a complete loser and piece of shit. Even my friend was disappointed, saying she thought I was smarter than that. I am smarter. But recently, not so muchI just try so much to care or motivate myself for the things we all look forward in life. Money, getting a job, being with friends, love and sex. I just do not know where I belong. I get upset at everything. I am filthy. As odd as this sounds, I feel like a failure. I have not felt like that for years.Still no luck with finding a job before college. At this point I hate the idea of it even. I have not enjoyed sex or dating at ALL. Every little thing just pisses me off or makes me inpatient. I will try meeting with people whom I think I will like and just completely get them out of my life before I let them in. I know it is so fucked up but I just want to feel at peace with myself. Enjoy company. Enjoy sex and the luxuries of getting that sweet, sweet paycheck. it is sad, before anyone points it out. I do not even want to die. I just feel like I prefer being a nice place away from everything. Before someone points it out, yes it is unhealthy. Staying in bed all day is unhealthy I am in a phase of life where I just want to be a quiet little place, and it is hurting everyone around me",1
I cannot explain how tired I am of feeling this way. I feel like I am trapped. If I commit suicide then all it will do is hurt people. If I stay I will continue to be hurt. When is it supposed to get better,1
Or anything else that would make me feel and possibly maybe wake me up from this cycle How deep a cut has to go for me to just pass-out?,1

I just want to work and maybe do some drugs and blow my brains out man. I mean i do appreciate what mental hospitals can do but how degrading, costly, and boring that would be as an adult. I feel like as an adult i have to make my life or take my lifeTheres no point to anything My Rant",0
I do not feel good. Just hating myself even more. Hope it is as easy as pulling the trigger... Wish a handgun was on my table right now...,1
Shitty thing to say i know right? But i just do not care about that part anymore because I would be dead anyways so i mean... To be honest hurting people that care about me by killing myself has become such an afterthought i just do not care how bad my suicide would hurt them,1
The biggest lie I was ever told is that it gets better. Its been over 3 years since my attempt and nothing has changed. I am still in agony. The future is terrifying. I am loosing all faith in God. Please stop testing me God I cannot fucking take this anymore. Just take me now. The biggest lie I was ever told,1
I have been on sertraline for about a month now. I took 25 mg for the first two weeks and now I am on 50 mg. I have a psychiatrist appt later to maybe update my dosage to 100 mg. I am not on any antipsychotics atm but my psychiatrist has mentioned wanting to put me on olanzapine for quite a while now and I think hes going to bring it up now that the antidepressants ordeal is mostly settled. I am very scared. I have never taken an antipsychotic before. I have done some research myself and I found that it increases the risk of irregular heart rhythm and this is just terrible really because I already suffer from irregular heart rhythm due to anorexia. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has taken this combination can share their experience and maybe provide some reassurance Has anyone here taken olanzapine and sertraline together?,0

"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar. PS. The matrix is one of my favorite movies. 26m no degree, no job, no car, no money, live in basement / tl:dr",0
"I lay on an air mattress in an empty room. there is three framed drawings leaning on the latticed wall, of writings I wrote as a kid. there is a chrome plated lamp plugged in to an open outlet, a cabinet of gemstones mounted on the wall, and a little green vine in a glass jar. there is a pair of headphones to my left and a computer out of battery to my right. The last dying shades of pink leave me in darkness as the night approaches.I am running away soon. From this. I cannot deal with everything that is happened in the past weeks. I am running from school. From my parents. From my dying extended family. From my misery. And I am not the reason I am running. I am not the initiator. None of what is hurting me is caused by my hands. I try to calm myself. But I cannot. So tomorrow, I run or the next day. Or maybe I will never amount to anything and never do it.Will someone force a way into this account while I am gone? Will they see the malignant sludge that is my profile? Will people care again if they see my name on the news? I cannot stand being alone anymore. it is terrible, but I yearn to be cared for.what is more valuable, me, or the idea of me? During every relationship, romantic, sexual, plutonic, otherwise that I have ever had with someone special-- I feel like it was the latter, looking back. So I will give in. They can have the idea of me if I die while I am out there.I am so fucking sad but somehow also so fucking numb. I cannot feel anything other than just passive depression, the wary passage of time, and my blood pressure.I am going to run to find my purpose. If death finds me while I am out, so be it. what is the worst that could happen to me? I get abducted? Unlikely, and I will see that when it happens.I am packing lots of nonperishables, just to keep me alive. Refillable water bottles and a plastic box. My school ID. All the paper money I have, but with a fake wallet in case I get mugged. Tissues. Stationery. A mirror. All three of my working cell phones. A battery bank. This is happening. it is real and it is happening and it is happening tomorrow.Maybe it is the ultimate act of selfishness, save for outright killing myself. it is not as if I have not tried that, so this is just something new. I have been nothing but the best I can be and here I am. So I am going out to find myself. I will see you all on the flipside. Another night",0

"Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, ""I am depressed."" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is ""depression""? I invite you to share your information and opinions.",0

"I have felt this way for 6 years now. I feel so permanently stuck in this depressive, hollow, empty life. I have become so numb to everything that it hurts to think about how much I have changed..I tend to keep myself from relationships due to my emotional unavailability from depression because I will know that anyone I date will just feel ignored. I do not want to hurt anyone and do genuinely care about people, even if they do not care about me.I am terrible at explaining my emotions and I apologize ahead of time if this sounds jumbled and repetitive. When I was 10 I was raped. As a male I was pretty much ignored because my attacker was female and it sucked. Losing 2 loved ones to cancer, my dad had a stroke, and my mom was unavailable because she had to take care of my father. When I finally told my parents they supported me fully and took very good care of me to get mental health support. My life has been pretty much existing day to day. Not living, just existing. I feel completely numb and have spent most of my days begging to God for something to change, pleading that my life will be better but it has not. I have tried several coping skills for depression but they always seem to be temporary and never last no matter how long I use them.Over the years I have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, PTSD and ADHD. All of which culminate into a bundle of nerves and depression that desperately wishes for the touch of others yet is too scared to let anyone near him or get to know him. My friends that do genuinely know me and care for me have stuck with me for years and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life.My sister is my best friend and she has helped me through so many issues that I could never repay her for. I feel guilty for venting to her sometimes though because she has her own issues and she does not need more to add to her pile.Most of my day is spent sleeping, eating, and reading or playing video games on the occasion where I feel even remotely alive enough to do so.I have never self harmed or attempted suicide and never plan on it for the sake of my family and friends but that does not mean I do not wish I did not exist sometimes. I hate myself for what I have become and worry every single day that I will become nothing and end up somehow more worthless than I already am. I know I am intelligent (please do not think I am bragging I promise you I am not), and that is the worst part. I know I have potential, but I am so downtrodden and depressed that I have no motivation or drive to accomplish anything. My love for history and geography is something that I cling to, because I do not have much left.So here I am, here is all that I am, and I do not know what I am doing anymore. I mind feels so permanently foggy and confused that I cannot even think straight anymore. I am in this constant daze and I just want to think right for once. Numb",0
"It was like an addiction that I cannot end the cycle ofIve finally decided to stop buying games.

I am not going to buy anything anymore !! No more stress about refunds and no more g2a keys that I cannot refund. I think the stress relief will be amazing.

"My mother is too attached to me and I understand why but I feel trapped whenever I am with her. I am a 21 year old and I am tired of staying at my parents. I get that they depend on me for a lot of things but sometimes its so hard to tell them that I cannot strive when I am with them. I got the opportunity to move out but now she wants me to come back to her. I love her so much but I want to stay strong for her by having distance between us. I want to be successful and have the freedom that I have always wanted. Its not fair that my older sister has the opportunity and she is just a year older. I am not a child anymore, for god sakes I am a full grown woman. I wish my mom would understand that. Btw plz check out my art :)) I just want freedom",0
"So I only have one sister, and growing up I have seen how different we are raised. As the eldest I am expected to learn all the household stuff, do them quietly and perfectly. But when my sister was at the age where she should have learned and done the stuff I did my mother never forced her to do any stuff (it is the culture but really? how fair is that?) Mom would also guilt trip me whenever I refused to do my sister's homework or project.I spotted a lot of difference as we grow older. Whenever their is conflict between me and my sister, no matter whose fault it was, they will side with her. Sometimes my father would just stay quiet because mom would get mad at him. that is why right now my sister thinks that she has the authority over me especially if I would defend or in their term ""retaliate"" to my parents. I am just tired with how things are at home.Just recently my sister and I fought, I am partly at fault because of my temper and I am just tired of them not remembering any of my preferences (they forget even the smallest thing about me.) I knew I am at fault too but for her to use the stuff that I fought over with my bf (she overheard it) during our fight is below the belt. so I told her that she has no right to use that against me. She burts out and threw things at me. She also tried to charged at me only to be held back by my mom. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not even have a safe space at home. I want to leave the house but if I did I can no longer supply their needs. because I have my own bills and needs to pay for... Eldest of two",1
"I have been working on getting better. I read a lot of your posts, and it disappoints me how many of us feel completely isolated from other people. Emotionally, we are trapped. Never feeling like we belong in the same existence as those around us. I do not know if that will change. Maybe someone will come around who things as I do, or understands my beliefs. The reality is, we do not know. So yes, I acknowledge how difficult this is for me, and so many of you like me. I do not have a lot of advice, and maybe this is me writing this to tell myself to listen but, stop worrying about the past. We lose people, we make mistakes, and we certainly miss out on opportunities. Moving through those past moments is the only option. Dwelling on situations that hold you down does nothing but solidify your beliefs of hate in yourself. Forgive yourself. They might never care that you are sorry, but you know you are. You know you grew from that mistake. My point is, sometimes you have to realize that you cannot gain anything else from constantly remembering the past. Some of us cannot help it, and I get that. Just do what you can. Be safe. Always reach out. The past does not own you",1
"Several months ago, I posted something about my luck and how I got depressed and suicidal thoughts. Since then I have tried really hard to get used to living alone and entertain myself alone through all kinds of channels. Of course I encountered some obstacles as always, including my first ever pet cat died of FIP within a month, which for some reasons I cried even harder than my break-up with someone I really loved.But next month, I will have to go back to my university for face-to-face lectures. Things are going to a lot different, and I do not think I am ready for it honestly, since all my daily routine has become completely pandemic-oriented. I do not know if I have the courage to change it all over again like what I did at the beginning of the pandemic.Right before the pandemic, my first year in the university was probably the happiest time in my life. I met a bunch of friends, had tons of ambitious goals which I found genuinely excited about, met my ex-girlfriend who kept me company through the first half of the pandemic. However, everything's different now, 9 out of 10 of my friends transferred to other universities, those goals I had were abandoned because of again the darn pandemic, and finally my ex. I imagine when I go back to the campus next month, I will have to act like a freshman and build everything again, except that now I am depressed, lonely, disappointed in life, more socially awkward than I was pre-pandemic. I do not know if I am able to do what I did one and half a year ago with my traumatized mind now.Acquire some crazy internship positions or become the head of student association are not my objective any more. I just want to make some new friends and be happy again. I am planning to attend some volunteer activities to make like-minded friends and wish me luck I guess. Fear of future change in life",0
Another day closer to the end. One more down,0
"All I ever wanted was a friend because you long for something you do not have, right? As a kid when i was just 3 years hardly, I would look around and see others eating together, playing around with a FRIEND. it is an age where you do not know anything and just be friends with anyone around. Well, this was what i thought because you be having no understanding that time and be pretty innocent. We all say being an adult sucks but no, it sucks to be a kid like me. Even at that age no one ever wanted to be my friend nor talk to me and it was because of this girl who had two sidekicks and they went around telling the whole class to not even talk or sit beside me. Now, you go and tell it to the teacher or your parents or something but at that age i did not know anything and so just let that happen to me. I would just cry by myself and tryna impress her, tryna make her a friend but now i regret that, am angry at myself to be that girl and not kick her ass. I went thru such trauma from a very early age.That did not stop there, it went on for years and is still going but the only difference is I roast their fucking ass now but I do not want to be this girl. I have random breakdowns and my life became better when i got my first friend in my 8th grade. I started pouring out myself to him and i felt better but I do not want to do this anymore, I was not this girl who used to depend on others, he makes me feel weak. When i never shared my trauma at that age then why now? But here i am. That went till my fourth grade with her in my class. My things were stolen each time, hidden or just simply thrown away in the dustbin. In fifth, our classes were shuffled and I get this class teacher who hated me. She holds my face and scratches on my forehead with her pen. People never wanted me to sit near them, they felt disgusted to even lend me a pen. Got a few fake friends till 7th later, which I already knew but I let toxicity in my life because for once, I was not lonely and it felt better. That girl who used to bully was this super cute popular girl who dated every senior and I never knew any, I never knew anything because i was so lost with dealing with these.And again, unfortunately we were in the same class again in 8th grade and this was when the seniors noticed me because I was in the same class as hers and all of a sudden, I get fame, became the girl every senior wanted while she was getting pretty jealous of me. I did not love that place either. I told myself to move on from all those tears she made me cry and when she hung around, I did not ignore but just spoke less and there was this day where we both were alone at an event and she decides to make me her accompany for the day and well, we both just looked out for ourselves. I do regret hanging around with her but I have always been easy to be manipulated and at the end of the day her aunt comes and pulls me by my arm with a tight grip and spits on my face telling me to stay away from her niece because am a spoilt brat. My eyes just teared up but no, I walked away. I was spoilt for talking to her boyfriend who her aunt did not even know about.She always got things so easy, friends, opportunities, guys, awards. Not that she was good at it, because her aunt was the administrative or smth of the school and she was pretty. I had to earn every of those. And again, my only bestf was my senior who left the school and I am having to face those kids once again though we still talk and tryna meet up. It feels i will never be able to move on from this as I have always ignored i was going through this and today it just feels like a lot to ignore again. I do not expect anyone to read this till here, but if you did, thank you :"") I have been broken for so long and now it is hard to put back those pieces.",0

But the medical industry i.e. the psychologist and psychiatrist thrive off this because it gives men purpose and it is designed to control the population so we do not engage in the act of reproduction.Pick your poison money or god - eventually both sides will steal your hard work because both sides are great at stealing but not good at creating original ideas because they have killed off their feelings by either doing drugs or smoking.

"Title pretty much explains it all. I am going to have to repeat 1 or 2 more years of high school and the thought of that makes me want to slit my own fucking throat. Because of this pandemic and my lazy ass, my grades have gone completely down the toilet. I also do not have a job, or a drivers license, which is pretty fucking pathetic. And before you say it gets better in college! I am too fucking poor to get into any type of decent college. And even i was able to, id probably just end up flunking out or killing myself anyways, so it does not really matter. I have already fucked up my life at 17 and honestly i deserve it.

"really wish i could talk to someone but my best friend is the reason I am so sad. i got my life fucked and flipped over 5 years ago and I have just been picking up pieces ever since. I am in therapy three times a week I am on drugs that are meant for war veterans and every meaningful person in my life i have effectively pushed them away. no good excuse besides being ruled by trauma and not being able to cope effectively. i see my last lifeline just kind of living and having a good time and being present and I am so jealous its hard to talk to her at all. I am so behind I am never going to make it to where everyone else is. I have attempted twice and idk why i have to be alive. why do i have to be here. i just try to make it through every day i do not have purpose. i can hardly feed myself. everyone else is making strides in their lives and moving to new cities and jobs and everything. I have been stagnant for 5 years. I am 23. my life got fucked at 18 and I am mentally still fucking there. because i cannot get away from my thoughts man. 6 mental diagnosis later and i just cannot do this shit anymore. I am tired of seeing people have all of the things i so desperately want. it comes to everyone else so fucking easily. i get how people say ""no do not die you have sm to live for you are so young"" ya ok that does not apply to me. i do not have so much to live for. i have no desire to continue because i am never going to fucking catch up. i do not want the life i live. i do not want the things that have happened in my life. i did not ask to fucking be here. i just take up resources that could be better used with people who have lives worth living or at least passion and drive. the only future i see for myself is in the fucking ground within the next few months. the life expectancy for my illnesses is 39-42 anyways. oh by suicide if you were curious.

"Hey guys I am tired of life and I feel like I am tired of it since I went to kindergarten where I had to learn about societal categories and adult concepts and how reality has to be perceived if you want to be seen as a sane person and how reality actually works for humans in a society. Of course I can find joy in things, such as my hobbies or perhaps even few social contact but overall Id say *life sucks* and this is such a truth for me that I would not even care if it was a tattoo on my arm. I am a person who is always aware that reality is just a subjective interpretation so I do not stick much to any political parties for instance. Some say that it is a good trait but.. I feel like many many humans love to attach stickers to themselves and identify with something while I cannot do it for a longer time, I fit in no particular group because I cannot accept absolute truths but speaking from my experience they are present in every group. They are not even verbal but sometimes unwritten rules, a certain rigidity that bores the f*** out of me. So I am a bit lost person In social situations I participate, not with the greatest initiative but I do. But while smalltalk or talk that people would not even call smalltalk anymore one part of me is focused on smth else.. On the person I interact with, the way he/she speaks, is dressed, why exactly like this, what does he/she want to communicate about themselves, is this gesture adapted from a certain group of people or is it natural/authentical.. I think it is normal to analyze our fellow people but I do it to such a great extent that I think its just distracting from the main purpose: to find joy in the actual social interaction. But I ultimately think Hmm I know now more or less what kind of person this is and more conversation is unnecessary. So how tf do I find joy in that? The answer I usually get is: You probably just did not find the right people yet. Maybe.. I have some tho. But I have to live most of my life not with them because I have to be at work or uni and I should not hate it there. Also I have been in different places with different people, I have been to pole dance, hung out with gamers, tried/been forced to christian community, had an atelier with other artists, been in Goa scene and overall club scene where I live, been in different schools and worked in different fields and and and; it has always been the same. It is not them, it is me. Me together with others is just meh So I realized a big part of my boredom is faced towards society or let us say interaction with humans. I am not a misanthropist, I highly value and appreciate many creations of humans, I can see that some humans are just really nice people, and many tremendously suck balls. But as I stated above: life sucks, I guess it does particularly as a dissident and as a not really social person. So what do I do? I realized already as a child that I feel less joy than majority. Is it eternal high functioning depression or do I just have antisocial squidward personality and have to somehow live like this? Is this depression? Doomed personality? Or just decreased ability to find joy in many things because I am low key asocial? Or is this all the same..",0

"I have flirted with the concept of suicide for most of my life. I have even experienced brief bouts of ""suicidal ideation"" all which manifested themselves in response to something or someone. All brashly reactionary. And if I am being radically honest with myself, I believe I would have been too scared to actually follow through with the act, had I a means of ending it during those very brief stints. As silly as this sounds, it helped a lot that I saw myself as... real. I was a real person. Like, I was [full name redacted]. I had hobbies. I had talents. I had upcoming trips on my calendar. I had obligations which I actually excelled at showing up for. I had the makings of a future. There were people who were active in my life and I in theirs. I did not hate myself. I was actually an alright person for a minute there...Oh but being talented and having hobbies and having a supportive circle of people who value me as much as I do, them, etc... Sure. Those things should absolutely *not* be taken for granted but of course that is not the same as being mandatory prerequisites in order to have a future worth living to see to it is natural end. But then, as it always does, stuff happened: life happened.. and blah blah blah. Still though, I suppose I should not use the phrasing ""-but then,"" since I was just about the same as before with regard to how I thought about the topic of suicide. It was merely something I tried to understand but could not, for the simple fact that I was not actually a suicidal person; thus there existed a mental block of sorts preventing my mind from fully going there and grasping the concept to my satisfaction.**Now fast forward to... Lately.** I... must have crossed a line of sorts somewhere, somehow. Maybe the losses in my life are piling too high, maybe my agoraphobic tendencies which keep me isolated from the world are doing some fucked up shit to my brain, maybe its that I have been battling an IV heroin addiction for years, to the extent I cannot recognize myself. What I *do* know iswhen I come across the subject of suicide in any context and by anyoneit's not fear or unease that surfaces within me (at least not initially, these emotions do come up though in response to my lack of being afraid of the act of suicide). Nor is it innocent introspection, pondering about when my husband committed suicide a decade ago now No... instead I experience an anticipatory... excitement? The sensation is very similar to that feeling you may get when you are underwater, you know you will be able to come up for air soon, however you cannot just yet. **it is frenzied eagerness for relief... I guess even at the cost of yanking a steering wheel, or finding a vein to pump a lethal amount of opioids into.***The internal monologue basically goes something like""... FINALLY it will stop, at last the loudness will end, the sharp edges of existence will cease, and I will experience the epitome of true nothingness. or in other words: paradise.""* Read Before I Go",1

"Hi all! I (22m) currently an university student, was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder way back in 2016. Since then I have been on constant medication and at some points I did not take meds but since last year I have been taking them regularly. My OCD is not a problem now, all is under control but last year in March I cut myself so now I have a forever mark on my hand. I felt really bad at that point of time. Since recently I do not have any will to do anything, I just smoke and smoke cigarettes.... In one month time I have gone from 10 a day to 20+ a day. When I was a teen I hated the smell of cigs and I would have never imagined I would start smoking. I am in my last year of studies but I still have 7 exams left... my peers are about to graduate and I am still, I would like to finish my undergraduate studies in history but I feel sick of it right now. I am planning to study 3D Game Art from November. At least that was a plan because I was thinking to finish history by then but it seems that will not happen... Video games are my true passion and not history, something I previously thought it was. I do not know what to do with myself, I am just to lazy for everything, I do not even play video games that often because I am lazy and without any will. I feel like I just want to go out and hang with friends and drink coffee and cocktails. That makes me happy now. I am going back to my home country next week so there I will talk with my psychatrist who is known me for a long time now. What do you think? Is this depression or am I just too lazy?

They kicked me out for more than a week and I know that does not sound like much but for me it was a long time. A long time do not getting replies to my texts I sent to the people that are my closest. Having to see how they have fun without me through social media did not help the situation. But the only thing I can say is I am sorry. Sorry for what I have done. And I have said that many times. I promised that I would change and I feel regret. But they do not believe me.

"I have felt like this for a while however only recently realised shit maybe I am depressed. I suppose its just not a nice realisation to make. there is this constant gnawing at my chest, not quite a pain but a presence that pushing on my chest, with my worst days life being unbearable agony and pain. I have got good friends and I am happy that for the most part I can enjoy my time with them despite that cavity in my chest being a constant present but as time goes on, I notice I am experiencing increased highs and lows. Its bizarre but I have been the happiest I have been in a while (despite being depressed I suspect for a year or two now ) singing with these friends a week or two ago, nothing special but I was ecstatic for a week and then all of a sudden I became the most depressed I have ever been. It also somewhat scares me that I think my friends noticed this, although I understand the irrationality of this fear. I am not in as deep as a low now anymore (hence which I am on reddit looking for help I suppose) but I do not really know if or indeed how long I will yo-yo like that. I am sure it does not help for my moods that I am basically starving myself right now but that is what I am doing regardless. I am very conscious of my wrong actions and yet I do them anyway, and I do not know why. Also I think about killing myself quite a bit, what would other people think, how would I do it but that being said I think its more of a thought experiment than me genuinely being suicidal. I do not really know what this most is other than me admitting to myself that I am indeed depressed. Time to go out and look for meaningless sex I suppose. Jokes aside thanks for the platform and I appreciate any antidotes or advice you have. I have realised I am probably depressed/rant.",0
"I do not sleep well, I do not have friends, my girlfriend is unhappy a lot of the time, I have not worked for 5.25 years. Everyday, I feel more disconnected, totally numb and just want it to end. Completely indifferent to any state of being. A dark place",0
"I have met this guy, who I thought was the most amazing guy I have met in a long time. We seemed to be really into each other, enjoyed each other company, went on about 4 dates that had me fall for him badly.I have a history of disastrous dating experiences, most people I have seen never even got to the dating stage, it is just how I am, makes people want to distant themselves.I have noticed this time I came on too strong, like I confessed him how much I was into him after a couple dates. My social anxiety makes me shut down my personality when I am with someone I like, because I am scared of being judged. My mind just goes in auto pilot, I blank, I stutter and do not even realise I am being weird until afterwards, thinking I should have been more spontaneous. I think to his eyes I might have appeared like I did not want to deepen our connection, looked uninterested and uninteresting, all because I was not comfortable with myself being around him.Also think that the quality of our dates was not varied enough, which might have quickly killed the interest, we were just hanging out at each others' with no real plan or activity set in place, so that might have made it stale.It kind of died when we agreed to meet up one weekend where he said he would let me know if he was free, then never called and have not heard from him since then.I am so sad and annoyed that I have allowed the fear of being myself in front of him being the reason of him getting bored of me.I have been through a hell of a year, escaping an abusive friendship which has made me miserable for a good part of my days, and is still causing me mental distress. I have only slightly mentioned this to him, without going too much into detail because I did not want to freak him out, just like I have left out many of the issues that I struggle with with my mental health.I cannot see any light, I want to be better, I want to make me happy and be happy with someone, I just never know how much of me it is okay to share with someone. They freak out if I tell them I like them, they freak out if I stay silent, they freak out if I talk about my demons. I know I should talk about what makes me interesting, my dreams, my values and what I believe in, the truth is I do not have enough self esteem to even be able to believe in myself, if I talk about my dreams out loud I would sound unexciting because I have always been the last person to believe in me. it is a lot to ask anyone to put up with such an emotional mess, I know no one is perfect, but I doubt anyone would want to start a relationship if they fear their partner would be problematic to be around. I might have freaked out the guy I thought I would start dating",0
"I realize that one of the things that really makes me happy in life is video games, so I am always thinking about them and researching them and buying them. However, its like every time I buy a new game I am happy, but then weeks or months later, I am depressed again, and I always want more. I do not get it, the moment I think xy game will make me happy, xy game will cure my depressionit does not. I am just spending money on games just to make myself feel good a bit and then I realize that these things only bring small periods of joy. they are just material things, I think I get too obsessed with materialism and I drive myself crazy sometimes because all I can think about is games and being happy only if I have more of them. What do you guys think I should do about this feeling idk. Its just embarrassing. I have a problem (Materialism)",0

"A long story short. I have a ton of student loan debt because I had no idea what I was doing and neither did my parents and now I have been in a huge mess for the past 8 years and I cannot take it anymore. I feel so invisible. No one talks about debt. My parents do not want to help. I have worked so hard to pay the bills and keep my head above water and feel like I have nothing to show for it because throwing the money at a useless degree that I did not even need. I get so jealous when I hear peoples parents paid for their college or help them. Why am I not deserving of my parents help? Why cannot I be like those lucky people who had smart parents who were looking out for them? Even if my parents could not afford $1 towards my education, I wish they guided me and told me the school I chose would be a huge mistake. Every day I wish I could go back in time and do it all over.

I am struggling on day 2 trying to not think about how I have been there for them and would do anything for them. I have never done anything to hurt them, yet I let them hurt me countless times. I know that you are supposed to find ways to cope and feel better. My family is helping the best way they can. But it is hard when I considered them my family, my life. My brain just will not let go. I just hate it. They act like getting fed up with me and not being my friend was going to magically stop the depression. I also do not use the internet a lot. All of them were in person, did not live too far away from me type close friends. What I am trying to say is this post alone is a big step for me. My Bffs got sick of ""always"" hearing about me being depressed when I have always been there for them",0

"I did not start at this company 21 years ago with any ambition or goal other than to have a job. I just stayed . . . and stayed . . . and stayed, wasting away my 20s, 30s, and into my 40s. My role has changed significantly and I am currently making more than ever because I was asked to take on different roles. However, I am absolutely miserable and am at a low point with this job. I had an argument with a person I have worked with for about 19 of those years, someone I would consider a friend. she is upset with my management style, and I also made a ridiculous mistake a little while ago that could because some problems. What comes with such a long time at it is a feeling of not knowing what I would do without this job. I would feel adrift. I have a job I am looking at, but I do not know all the details or if I would like the environment. I just like the schedule. I would probably make about half of what I am currently making. So let us say I get that job and it sucks. What would I do? I have been at my job way too long.",0
"I am turning 18 next spring. I have been suicidal since I was 12, so understandably I have never had any realistic plans in life. I can do art and I can write, but that is it. You do not support yourself with that where I live. I always thought that I would just kill myself before I would get anywhere. I genuinely thought that I would not see my 14th birthday and eventually turning 17 was a miracle. Now that I am 17, it hit me that I do not have any plans or dreams beyond ""oh I should wrote a book"" and then a watertight, fully doable, realistic suicide plan I have worked on and improved for years. I do not know what to do with my life when I never even planned on living this long. But hey, if it all goes to shit, at least I still have that plan up my sleeve. I will probably do it before it even goes to shit, just so I do not have to die in dirty clothes. I am just realising that I am getting closer to adulthood and I still do not know what to do",1
I am 17 M have lost all faith in anything better coming in my life. My whole life my family just seems to attract abusive pieces of shit who do nothing but torment me in every way. I always expected there to be some repercussions for their actions towards no they always get way free. Me getting my head beat in me getting molested no one ever help's. People tell me evil never wins its a lie all it ever does is win. I hate the hand i have been dealt i hate how my dad did not want to accept me as his and abandon me. I hate christianity for the terrible brainwashing and abuse it put me through. I fell like there is no hope i have lost all faith no light at the end of the tunnel. I am considering overdosing on datura. I am so sick of evil winning in my life.,1
"Hello everyone,I am considering starting psychotherapy (again). I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically, even if there is nothing going on, I feel constant anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money). This also causes my anxiety. &amp;#x200B;I appreciate any thought, idea, and help. Thank you :) How can I overcome my feelings of anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain?",0

"I have been depressed for the majority of my life. So much of my life was was either an uneventful blur or I was depressed or extremely depressed. I did however go through a stage in my life where I would say I experienced genuine happiness. I think about this time all of the time and have realized it only amounts to a few memories. I cherish these memories more than any other ones but it does make me sad that there is such a limited amount of them. It feels as though happy people create good memories all of the time, they seem to have so many that they forget a lot of them. It also makes me wonder if the total quantity of happiness really is important, I am just grateful to have experienced any at all. An analogy would be does it feel better to have won 10 championships or 3 in your life time? Probably the more the better. I am still grateful that I have been able to experience happiness at all in my life, even if short lived. Now I am just depressed like I normally am. I only have a few memories in my life of being truly happy",0

"I am 15 and I am depressed since last year. Its not that much, but it simply hurts. Every single day hurts. I have been thinking of committing suicide since march this year. I cannot do it. I know i will not just do it so i choose to stay here and numb the pain. How do i do that? I light up a cigarette when i feel like I am at my worst. But i guess I am starting to get addicted. When i feel emotional pain, i crave for a cigarette so badly, it seems like the only way to make me feel better. And you know what other advantages smoking and probably other kind of drugs are going to bring me? they are going to finally kill me. I hope i die in my early 20s or something like that. I do not think you can get a disease from smoking in your teenager years. I am so messed up. I do not know what can truly help me right now, the pleasure those cigs bring me lasts a few hours. I do not want to get locked up in a hospital. What am i supposed to do? There is still a good side in me, a side that still wants to live, but this side is weak as fuck compared to the negative one.Sorry if i bothered anyone, i had to tell someone about it. You know its bad if you have to use drugs to numb the pain",1

"As of this writing, I have got a new friend I met here on Reddit, that was talking to me 5 hours ago, or so. No responses since, no message explaining their absence. I have a girl I pay to talk to me, because I am that goddamn lonely, and she is been absent since almost 12 hours ago. I have a couple older friends that have talked to me for a while, but of late they have been really quiet. Nobody has responded to me today. The closest I have had to meaningful conversation came via welcome messages to a support forum I joined. I am alone, painfully and completely alone. I want to die. I have not decided on how yet, but I am done. I hate this world, I hate the fact that I need people who clearly do not care, I hate that everyone that ever tells me they are my friend abandons me. So I promise, this time tomorrow, nobody has to bother pretending anymore. You can all just relax, and forget I ever darkened your inbox. Pretend I never existed at all, that could be a fun game. And to anyone that thinks they can just talk me off the edge with a little friendship, and I will be fine after, please do not. I do not need to hurt any worse, I just need to let go. Please let me let go. Abandonment issues, they finally won. Peace out.",1

The fact that we are alive is due to all our effort that is put into existing or trying to get better, it is a lot.Despite your brain telling you that you are worse than the scummiest scum.

"Crosspost + I do not know where to start. This is going to be very long and I do not expect anyone to read it.&amp;#x200B;what is been weighing heavy on my mind since I woke up this morning is AM. Those are his actual initials and that is really all he is to me. And bad memories. I have nightmares regularly with him in them. I cannot help but want to ask him if he is sorry 2-3 years later. I could not believe my eyes the day I found cp on his second phone. You may ask yourself: ""second phone?"" then glance up at the red flag. Yeah, I have a hard time not blaming myself for falling in love with someone I can clearly see was a terrible person in hindsight. But I did.I told myself for over a year afterward that I would never be capable of loving someone so endlessly and freely. Part of me still believes that. Part of me knows that is the grooming and abuse still doing its job. However, none of me genuinely feels bad for myself. I wanted to die before I met him and I want to die now. I wanted to die when I was with him, too. A rapper I like said it best ""I still want to die, but got someone to do it with.""I think what makes it so difficult is that we were junkies in love. Spending all my money on drugs of choice. Being in love on drugs cannot compare to doing it sober. I still cannot figure out if he knew what he was doing or if he was just so fucked up that he cannot see what he did.For the sake of TLDR, I think the one story I will share is the day he was trying to convince me to give him back his second phone. For context, this was directly prior to the purge on Tumblr. Before the purge in general.I had found cp one time prior around Christmastime living in a motel, but I was so deeply disgusted and disturbed and also (literally) was not trying to invade his privacy, that he easily convinced me it would never happen again and it was a one-time thing that he felt extremely guilty for. I have to excuse myself here and say I was extremely drugged up and not thinking clearly.The next time I found it was after we moved into an apartment and signed a lease. I was looking through his phone and found way more evidence than would have been needed to convict him. I told him and took his phone and almost always kept it on my person. He played nice for a couple days, trying to get me not to go to the police. Which worked. What also worked was the day he blew up. He told me he felt like I was keeping the phone instead of getting rid of it to spite him. I told him I was not sure what I wanted to do yet. He practically begged me to give it back to him. So I took it and threw it into the dumpster in our apartment complex. I told him if he wanted it, he could climb in there and go get it. I am not sure if he did. I would not put it behind him.&amp;#x200B;The other thing weighing heavy on my mind is SW. Also his actual initials. Also only bad memories. Sometimes I have nightmares about him, too. This one is hard because I blame myself entirely for it even though I advocate that teenagers/children are not at fault if an adult takes advantage of them even if they initiate it or think they want it. The age difference was about 10-12 years, but the exact number escapes me. I was a minor at the time.I think he was the first one who ever told me to call him daddy. I do not have any words in my head when I think about what happened, it is really only flashes of what I can remember and what I felt. I feel disgusted by my former self for allowing SW into my home and letting him do those things to me. I remember the smell of cheap beer and menthol cigarettes on his breath. I remember the process of letting him get away even though my mother contacted the police. I remember his girlfriend messaging me on facebook some time later, asking what SW said was wrong with her. That is so sad.&amp;#x200B;What it boils down to is this: after SW, I attempted suicide. I would have succeeded if what I hung myself from did not break. After AM, I never properly attempted, but today I am surprised that my recklessness and inconsideration for my own life did not kill me.Today, I weigh a lot on how easy it would have been to commit suicide after AM. No one cared about me, I did not talk to family or friends, and I had nothing at all going for me in my life.Today, it is only hard to do it because of my responsibilities and shame. there is not much more to say here. Of course, there is also the fact that my boyfriend and family would have to cope with it, but some of that ties into responsibilities instead of actual guilt. It would be easier if I was high and I just want to say fuck it and go buy drugs. But I do not know what my boyfriend would do. Part of me literally does not care because he kind of treats me like shit, too.I literally do not want to put in the effort of getting better. I do not want to have to find a counselor/therapist/psychiatrist. I do not want to have to try different medications when being high is so much better than being happy. I do not want to talk about what happened to me because there is nothing I can do to make it not happen and because I cannot fucking kill the people who hurt me the most. As far as I know, too, they are fine. they are fucking fine. And I am still struggling to be a person. I just wish there was a switch that could make it better or just never happen in the first place so I did not have to put in the effort to get better for things that were(n't) my fault. I should have killed myself after AM then I would not have to hurt my best friend/boyfriend and my family I have gotten closer to since I got sober. I wish I never got sober. I wish I let him kill me. I should have killed myself when it would have been easy",0

"Hi everyone,I am a 23 year old female. I am going into my last year of nursing in September. I have found through the years that I am extremely lonely.

Why go on, if only to regret being a fucking wimp in 3 years. It really gets harder and harder every day to solicit staying alive, when everyday is pure and unfiltered pain, and all good things are tinted with constant mental screaming and pain. Everything means nothing anymore, people, places and objects completely void of any attachment or meaning. I feel like I am losing my ability to care about the things and the people that mean the most to me, and that thought terrifies me. Nothing is physically wrong in my life, but the suicidal thoughts, the lonlieness and the crippling social anxiety really never stop.

"I am 24 this year and my life has not been shittiest than now.At 16 my mom kicked me out, I graduated high school living at my aunt's house, it was really better than being with my mom who really does not like me for stupid reasons (I am not violent or anything she is just ""old-school).3years later I was sent to a big city to go to college but I have PTSD and I slept 18 hours a day because every single friends I had was sent to private college in Paris or whatever so I have lost them all and it pushed me into a deep depression. I had to come back to my little town but I knew that I have fucked up so much because it is supposed to be the best years of your life and I have slept all time long, smoking weed at night and taking benzos and anti-depressants to fight my social anxiety. My aunt and uncle just moved out far from where I live and now they have kids so they do not have time or desire to help me, they are busy. So I am alone in my grandma's house since last summer and I never felt that alone of my entire life. I barely go outside to buy food. Now I am lost, I have no idea of what to do I feel trapped here and I cannot see emergency exit. If someone have ideas of what can I do to feel a little bit better I would really appreciate.Sorry for my english I tried my best, hope it does not kill your mood. I have lost everything",1
"I am less than two months from going to graduate school, and yet I have never been closer to committing suicide. I have the majority of a plan in place and everything. If I make it to grad school, I have two years of that, and then an internship to start my job, which I can do pretty much anywhere in the country. It feels so far away. It feels like it will never happen. Even in high school I told myself to look forward, that college will be better. It was not, I spent my days laying in bed or working. Now I am afraid grad school is going to be the same loneliness and isolation, so much that I am fully prepared to end it before then. Why does life take so long to get started? Why is the ticket to true happiness and self-determination so elusive? Why does the tunnel to happiness keep going endlessly?",1
"No matter how many connections I make, I can never break the barrier and find someone I actually feel connected too.. &amp;#x200B;I feel like no one on this planet understands me. All I really want is to give and reciprocate all the love I hold in my life. &amp;#x200B;I cannot make friends.. and every man I meet just wants to hook up. I have so much pure kindness in my heart and no one to give it to. I think that is why I love animals... &amp;#x200B;I am drunk and very depressed. My meds help suppress it a bit but my life is very wrong.. I was not mean to be so alone. No one is. There are so many people around me and I cannot find someone who gets me??? Life feels like a ghostdown",0
"any tips to get through the day? Or to help feel motivated? I am feeling so depressed but I have to go to work if I want to pay my bills and eat lolll. I just want to stay home in bed, but I know I need to go. working while having depression",0
"In fact, I will live. I have deleted many post here but I think this one I will keep this one around. there is no hiding it, depression will be a part of me until the day I die, but today is not that day. Fellow hollows, keep the good fight going even when hope is lost. Fuck depression and it is depressive abyss, there is is still some good we can bring to this world. I want to live",0
"The other day, made the decision to get rid of the only means of ending my life that I had, all because I finally talked to someone about how I have been feeling. Now what do I do? ""Live"" until I eventually kick the proverbial bucket due to old age? Continue the cycle of suffering and brief moments of peace and happiness as a living corpse? People say ""it gets better"", even I have said it a couple of times, but I am just really skeptical about it. I wish I knew what to do... Best decision I have ever made?",1
I am just feeling so tired of everything. I feel so lonely and I do not know how to make it better. I am really trying and everyone thinks I am better but really tonight I can feel myself so tempted to make everything go away or at least go back to self harm. I just want it all to stop. Its all too loud I am really scared and I cannot be alone right now,1

Is anyone else just like full blown depressed and 100% ready to die at any moment but you just end up living life and being a complicit player in this weird SICK game lol I feel so confused and always think about taking my life but honestly its hard and takes so much work and effort and you just want to lay down and fall into a light blissful rest in which you hope you never wake from lolz lmk if you guys feel the same xoxox I am fully ready to pass away,0
"I feel like it is just over when I failed university, what do I even do now. Apply to another one? Like my parents had said but from them, it feels more like the degree worth more than whatever is there to do. I do not know, I feel like my scope of the world just constantly shrinking and I want to just end it. I am useless. ""you are young so have more energy"" does not apply to me, I feel like I am mentally had given up on myself long time ago. cannot do anything well, well enough",0
"So I (22F) was depressed for about 6 months. I blocked everyone out except my boyfriend who was the person who prevented from killing myself when I was alone. I could not do it because hes the last person who would even get depressed and somehow he just understands this issue so well. And I do not want to scar him for life. Luckily I got over it without meds. I started to wanting to be with my friends again. Being more present. Started thinking about others and wanting to do some stuff for myself. However these past weeks I feel like I am going back to that numb place. I had an episode where I stayed in bed all day because I did not want to meet a cousin of mine and I just feel shitty and anxious af for not doing it, like full depression mode for like 3 days. The sabotage part is I told him I would meet him the day before, and then I wake up and this huge feeling of not wanting to do it but knowing I am going to let someone down, completely takes over me. And I feel like I do this a lot but in other situations.I ghost people so easily its ridiculous. I do not even feel like replying to my friends (I am not on social media either cuz its just crazy to me now how people have energy for that), it takes so much of my energy. I only have energy for keeping myself alive and not wanting to kill myself, which is so selfish and such a difficult situation do describe to other people. I know how it is to be happy. But I have not in years. Also I totally despise the way we live as a society, this fucked up capitalist system and being part of it. I really wish I had the ambition to get out of it, its something that really bothers me as well.I do smoke weed regularly and no, if I go off it does not make things better or worse. It just helps not being so suffocated sometimes. I know this is all over the place but I just want to know what it has worked for you. I feel like I have 3 options: start taking meds which I really did not want to because my family has a history of dependency (meds/alcohol), and I have an addiction to weed however I can go without smoking it for several days. But I still consider it an addition because its like a cushion for my mind, everybody has addictions; I try to go full Unabomber mode without the bombs ofc; I kill myself. After my depression and happy period, I feel like I am sabotaging myself",0
"Man, when I thought these months were going good, nope it was preparing me for this 2 weeks before I felt on top of the world, nothing could stop me. I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good, until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine, time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing (fyi first time). Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me (fun). Fine, I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text (no response for days). Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know, my school work began to pile up and was now behind (awesome!) But the funny thing is, the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever, my ex(who hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with) dmed me months after our last talk. Ok, I am not upset or angry at her, she changed alot and is happy with her new bf (something I was hoping she would get) but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her, I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I (should not have done this) mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new life(mind you I wished for her happiness) because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. I am so tired of having straight up bad luck I want good things to happen (I also feel karma may have something to do with this)I am just done. The worst depressive wave this year",0
I cannot do this anymore. I am done,1
"I feel hopeless! I cannot eat, cannot sleep, cannot remember the last time i laughed! This all started once i decided to check up on my childhood friends from school. I am 24 years old and due to anxiety and depression I have had since i was eighteen led me to isolate myself everyone i knew. So fast foward to now. I went on linked and saw that my old friends are graduating with msc at the age of 24 and i started college jan 2021 but i fucked up my first semester. Ill be graduating at 27/28 with no Work experience. I feel hopeless. What makes it worse is that, is that i have zero self confidence due to my shitty childhood. My mom taught me to be afraid of everything and my dad beat the shitout of me and always told me i was dumb. But at 24 i cannot wait life to get better specially knowing how low my self-esteem. Through out my uneventful life i was always felt like i was going to grow up and have fun and exiting adulthood. But now i see that is not the case. The only thing stopping me from ending my life is, the pain it will bring my family. And also due to my religion. But incase this does not get better, what is the easiest way to commit suicide?do not have a gun. And i do not want to hang myself because, its painful, long and i would not know how to do it. I do not know any life threatening drugs and even if idid, i would not know how to get them. Throwing myself in front of a train seems to be my only option. Life passed me by",1
"My primary defense against depression is to keep myself distracted so I do not think about it. Sometimes it even works. Not this day. I cannot focus on anything. Nothing holds my interest for longer than a few seconds. Nothing I try to read, nothing I try to watch. I have not got the energy to do anything but sit here and endlessly scroll through Reddit, where half the posts leave me indifferent and the other half make me feel worse.Just another day in the life. Having one of my days..",0

"I have been attending university for about 5 years now, bouncing between programs and failing multiple classes. This summer I was able to complete about three more courses and I could graduate with a general degree. Its about 3 days now until i would have had my last exam and I have not done schoolwork at all. This is something I am not interested in and I had no motivation to do any of my assignments or work and now its come to bite me in the ass. Luckily, I got accepted to college in September for a program I think I am interested in. I could not find it in me to push myself to do anything for this, I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed my family is going to be knowing I am a failure. The only reason I was doing it was so it would look good on my resume and to make my parents proud of me. Its so hard to watch people I went to Uni with graduate, I envy their ability to put their education before their emotions and push themselves, I could not and now that is 5 years of money and time wasted - I just want to graduate and feel accomplished. I hate myself. [22/f] I have given up on Uni and I cannot stop beating myself up",0
"I am sick and tired of having my dramas and all my pain underrated. I am valid. My dramas are valid. All the pain I am going through is 100% valid. Everytime someone tells me the world owes me nothing, I get totally angry cuz they are always trying to invalidate my problems. 1st: I never said I wanted to come to this world. But if you ask me if I wanted to be born, Id say yes. For sure I would. But never in a poor family like my case. Id choose to be born in a wealthy family with two real parents and not two poor narcissistic parents like mine. 2nd: Human Rights assure me many things I never had. So yeah, the world would not owe anything if all my rights were assured. The reality is that they are violated all the time bringing me sorrows and unhappiness. The world owes you nothing. Oh really ? Listen then",1

"Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on ""gifted and talented"" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four ""real"" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Typing into the void.",0
I am 13 m I have been depressed and suicidal ever since quarantine started but its gotten worse over the past few months i suffer with depression anxiety a ED and undiagnosed ocd. depression has been kicking my ass for a while I have attempted non-alive countless times and obviously none of them worked. do not go in the comments and say wHat abOut yOur fAmily I have come to a point where idgaf about everyone else (not to sound selfish) anyways I am blaming this on a few people who deserve to get in trouble. and if you see this myah congrats. you got me to kill myself. you made all my friends look like complete assholes and you made me lose half of my friends and one of them was the only person keeping me alive. I am going to die tonight so why not just dump everything here?,1
Should I just do it? My mom just told me she would not tell me not to kill myself because life does not get better and she wishes she did it herself,1
"Sometimes something so profound happens in life that a drastic change is required. A complete and total system reboot and reprogramming. Such is my story and in that same sense, it is akin to trying to extract blood from a turnip.Many people try to convince me that I am no lesser, that I am just as human as they are. The unfortunate truth is that I am not, I am nothing like you, I could never be like you.I cannot whisk myself away into some fantasy reality where everything will be okay. I cannot lie to myself and say that I will change. I know what it would take for me to change, yet I know that change would only be temporary. I know I will end up exactly where I am, as I am, today.It brings to light just how magnificent you humans truly are. I still cannot even begin to grasp how you do the things you do, almost without even skipping a beat.It amazes me that people still even try to relate to a thing like me or try to be compassionate towards me. I am just a freak, a monster. I do not deserve any of it, yet people persist. it is awe inspiring, truly.To whatever extent, there may be a fraction of hope that remains within the hollowed out tusk of the human I was born as. Unfortunately, words could never fill that void. Not even compassionate, kind, encouraging words.The damage is done and I am far too aware of it to deny the overwhelming reality of it all. I am here because of me, I cannot blame it on anyone else.Why would I take my pain and put it out into the world? All I have to do is simply be present and people feel it. They become more aware of the threat I am. I have always compared it to having a neon sign on my forehead and to that extent, I suppose I should be grateful.At least people saw me for what I really am and made the right decision in avoiding me. that is reality.I have tried to play some role in this world and no matter what, I just never fit. that is reality. I am so cold towards myself because it is all I have ever been shown on any consistent basis. Sure, every once in a while someone tries to show some sense of connection and it often results in both of us getting hurt or leaving with hurt feelings and regret.that is just what it is to deal with me. I do not know why it is or what causes it, it is just there. I try my best to circumvent the issue by being more understanding and kind and compassionate, but even that is not enough to really outweigh the impact I have on others. It is still true that I am like a bad omen of sorts. I bring bad luck to those who come near me.that is just reality. that is my reality. I just do not want to push that on anyone anymore. I used to desire connection, love, belonging. But life has always had other plans for me.I am the outlier, an ever watchful eye that sees the beautiful treasures of humanity. But I will never find my way into that vault, I will never find my place amongst the most precious commodity. There is no space there for me, that is reality.But I can still admire just how beautiful you humans truly are, even as a monster. The Monster Who Grew a Heart",0
"These past few weeks have been... really trying. Never really been suicidal but it is been on my mind a lot lately. More than usual. I do not know, I just feel like I have failed in life. I am 25, still unemployed, virgin, no close friends, still struggle with anxiety, hardly any family aside from my parents. I just feel like I have nothing else to give.I lost interest in applying for jobs because they either reject me or ghost me. Been trying to get back into applying a couple days ago, but man, I just do not feel like doing it. Literally have no money in the bank, and feeling more and more pessimistic about life as the days go on. I have usually been the person to spread positivity to others, but now it is like I do not care about ""positive vibes"". I do not. I wish people could actually understand how I really feel, and why I feel like this. I just feel if I open up I will be treated even worse, or pushed away because it is ""too negative"". Anyways, I just wanted to vent and say what was on my mind. If it was not for my parents, or the fact I like to go for walks, I would probably be dead. I try to see the light at the end of the tunnel even if the tunnel looks blocked. The fact I am still here... probably means something. But it is been trying. Very, very trying. Just been hard lately. Trying to hang in there.",1

I get exhausted easily (mentally and physically), I cannot remember shit, I am always in pain unless I take my prescribed drugs or drink, and now people have been making me feel bad about it.

I gave my family and friends so much chances to show they love me. In this life, I was naive. I chose the wrong people to be close with. My life decisions were terrible.

I have been struggling to cope for a while. today i went out for the first time in months for a social gathering- was paniky the whole time and then my mom humiliated me in front of everyone by drawing attention to my self-harm.

"The last bad relapse I had was when I was 11, and I stayed in bed and did not eat/drink or go to the bathroom and cried and slept all day. For 3 days. Now 7 years later, I relapsed for a week and did not eat properly. I withdrew myself from my friends. The because of relapse? My mom overstepping my boundaries and worrying about her invading my privacy (like going through my diaries and journals. she is done it before so it could happen again). Both times I expressed/ attempted suicide I was screamed and shouted at for being selfish, inconsiderate and immature. I am simply tired of existing and no longer want to feel the pain I feel. Depression flared up again because of therapy and my therapist siding with my mom, who caused a lot of my issues, and not believing/ belittling me. ...And now it is been a good 5 days since I have eaten proper meals, interacted with my parents, or just functioned properly in general. I tried to choke myself 3 times this past week. I literally cannot come up with any other creative way to kill myself. I want help, but I do not want to go back to the hospital when I was the youngest one there. It felt like a fucking retirement home. My highschool counselor is away and I do not want to burden her. I hate my current therapist and want to look for someone else. I thought graduating highschool would make my life easier, but this year really turned for the worse for me. Anxiety attack for 3 whole months. On and off depressive episodes. Therapy is not working and mental health services are so slow and limited. Is there really hope for me when I am merely existing? It was not this bad before.",0
"This has been a long time coming. I have had depression since I was 9 years old and I am 28 now, turning 29 in November. I have decided to end it on the 20th anniversary. How can that be? I am not sure, but when I look back at my life, all I see are fleeting moments of happiness followed by long periods of misery. My family might find this so, I am not going to mention them, but the time has come. After all my attempts to get help, to get on medication, to try coping strategies, I just cannot do it anymored. Today, for the millionth time, I called out of work because I cannot take the pressure. Today, for the millionth time I turned down a guy online bc all men see me for is a good time. My overall depression leads to my lack of motivation which is why I keep losing jobs. I am pathetic and worthless. I am both lonely and alone. I have decided to call 911 right before and do it while my roommate is away. I am hoping my last days will be good ones. I am Ready",1
I know that I am loved. I know that my family would do anything to keep me here with them and make me smile and that is something a lot of people do not have. I just got slammed with some kind of mystery medical issue and its drastically wearing down my will to keep going. I was fine one day and the next I was not. I cannot function day to day like I used to. I feel sick all the time. I do not know how I am going to be able to work. I have seen numerous doctors who cannot explain what is going on or offer a solution. I cannot imagine living the rest of my life feeling like I am stuck in a body that is not mine and retching into a toilet for 4 hours every morning. I am so tired of feeling sick and sad and losing the life that I had before all of this started. I sit all day and cry and imagine different ways of dying. I do not have a point to posting this other than just typing out my feelings. I just want to feel better. I am not sure how I am supposed to go on.,1

I have been hospitalized for overdosing several times before and just overdosed again several days ago. when i get strong suicide urges i almost always turn to overdosing on my medications. i have no idea what to do tho. idk what i want in life, i just know its not whatever it is I have got going on rn. so I am not sure if i should switch my degree or just hope that I will be better a few years from now. i feel so lost and scared and all this stress really is not helping i think I am getting worse and I am scared of where I am headed",0
"I already know I do not have much of a direction in life. I always planned on committing to when I was 18 and now that I am just stuck. I am supposed to go to college but I do not really want to and Imnow signed up for classes but unsure of my major. I wanted to move out at 18 too and have someone that wants to be my roommate but I just cannot make myself take up on that opportunity.When I was 16 I had plans and full intentions to kill myself by a certain date, but then my (now ex) partner asked me about 10 days before that. I never told them this but still I based my entire future around that relationship. And I still had suicidal ideation throughout the entire relationship, the only thing that changed was that now I had a tangible reason to not do it right away. I feel like at that point I accepted that I was going to die from suicide, it was just now I was playing the waiting game for the final straw. I know that I still have time and opportunities and I know that I am skilled enough so that if I could push myself do to make something out of myself, I probably could. I just do not want to since I just do not care about living . Plus if you are a bad person and have multiple untreated mental illnesses and trauma should not be okay by a certain point?

"Just need to share this somewhere. Not sure why I feel like I need to live up to something, like I need to prove that I am capable of being successful. Despite having a chaos-free, generous life- it feels like my life peaked in high school (even though I felt just as worthless back then).Its almost like I have not been genuinely EXCITED about anything in a long time. I have not cared to try and improve myself or embrace a new project or do SOMETHING to make my life feel better.This all seems so trivial when comparing it to the problems of the world. It always feels pointless to share feeling bad about myself with people because at the end of the day, I am privileged to live such a cozy life and do not think its right to complain about my pride when others have to worry if they can feed their starving family or whether they will be harassed or assaulted today.I have picked up drawing as a hobby and I have an idea for a book finally outlined, so I have got to admit things are slowly starting to get better. I just did not know how difficult this whole self-actualization thing was going to be or why I care about it so much.******So there, I shared. Hopefully, I can start to think clearly again and worry less about my accomplishments and social status and just be happy to be alive. Thanks for listening. I hope others who feel stuck in a similar internal conflict can find peace. Realized that I am probably going to plateau for the rest of my life",0
"I have been bullied, made fun of etc. it started on my YouTube channel and then it escalated. Now the one who just made fun of me has hacked into my accounts or something and is leaking my private pictures over YouTube. YouTube will not listen and everyone is laughing at me. My father thinks I am secretly gay and that I have had sexual relationships with that bully. Everyone thinks this is just a joke. Maybe I should kill myself.

"So this year I turn 18 in just 4 1/2 months. and to tell the truth I am sitting on a time bomb. I am an impulsive liar. have been forever I am not going to justify it like I have a plan when i do it, i lie about everything from things as mundane as what time I did something to as extreme as what grade I am in. my parents think I am going to be a senior this year, I never even passed my first math class and the only reason I got through after the third time is because they passed everyone when the virus turned up.it is clawing at me every day. hell I am not even enrolled this year. i lied about showing up to my classes bullshitted my way through a whole year playing video games instead of doing school work. I have always been told that ""if you will not do this then what tells you you will do your work?"" I have always justified it with ""I would get paid to do work so I would do it."" the thing is even if that is true what the fuck does it mater if the earliest i can graduate is by the time I am drinking age?Every day I am stuck thinking in the morning the same damn thoughts ""what am i doing with my life?"" EVERY FUCKING DAY. I KEEP WAKING UP AND THINKING THAT EVERY TIME I GO TO PLAY GAMES..... it is the only thing i enjoy. I am not even sure I am having fun anymore i just do not know how to do anything else. I have tried going outside taking the dog for a walk and a bunch of other things but none of that gets to the heart of the problem. I am actively avoiding work of any kind. I mentioned a time bomb earlier, what I meant was in 1 1/2 months my parents will find that i did not sign up for classes and probably that I did not even get higher then a 30 for the year in any of my classes last year.I am t1 diabetic so sometimes at night I get dark thoughts when my head is not on straight. I will think ""all it would take is some sleeping pills and I could OD on insulin. I would go into a coma in my bed and probably die before anybody noticed because I am known to sleep sometimes to 3pm. it would be so easy and the only thing holding me back is knowing that my friends and family would be sad, but what happens when they realize that I am nothing. I manipulate people into liking me but never do any work. I can already see the kind of person I am turning into and I do not like what I am staring at.I would live off handouts, like a leech. so I am stuck thinking ""what is better I die while they think that i was just suicidal or when they realize that my lies go deeper. how far do I let them see before just ending it all to avoid confrontation. I have always had suicidal thoughts ever since I was 12. but it is never been this intense for this long. I know if I could think straight I could think of something but I cannot because every time i start thinking on things I come back to this. panicked and thinking of suicide. I do not want to kill myself I am firmly atheist and I do not expect anything other then eternal rest after I die.I do the stupidest things to try and fix my depression which is the only word I have for this besides maybe intense stress. I thought if I tried to be social and friendly, tried to be the ""funny guy"" that as time went on I would get better. Tried getting in better shape to see if everything else would follow starting with better hygiene. tried getting back in touch with close friends. nothing worked, it only served as a distraction...If I had to name the worse thing in all of this though. it is that I am not having fun anymore. maybe that is why I started lying, tricking people is fun. Now though I am not having fun anymore I have lied myself into a corner and got to claw my way out. I have spent the past 6 months playing games to ignore my responsibilities, and for 6 months it worked. hell it might even work for 2 more but... passed that this will all collapse. it will just be yelling and screaming. and i do not know what I will do when that comes, but considering where my thoughts are even now. i doubt it is something smart.To tell the truth I am pretty sure I wrote this for pity, it is all true but I am not looking for solutions. I already know them. ""Tell your parents about the classes, contact the school to sign up for classes, and work your ass off so you pass."" It all works out so well. easy solution to mundane problem. I am an asshole I know I am. but I am an asshole with shame so I will admit the truth. I do not fix my life because I am a lazy piece of shit that does not like putting forth any effort to live better, I am what happens when you live your life with all play no work and no money to back it. maybe one day I will be a door to door salesman and piss you all off.Sorry bout all that it is been a long night and I am thinking bad thoughts. going to go sleep on how stupid it was to post my situation on the internet. Tell me your thought's on my situation I tend to overlook other solutions once I have one in my headTLDR: lazy piece of shit wants pity for being a lazy piece of shit. My story I guess",1

I live hundreds of miles away from any family and my best friend killed herself when were 18, if you can try to give me a reason or even reason with me Id appreciate it.

"Hello guys, I am really sorry if this is not well written or understandable since English is not my first language but please read me since I want help PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME. This is the FIRST TIME I have asked for help anywhere. I have gamed my entire life, I got my first PC when I was 11 years old and now I am 23. I am still gaming and doing actually nothing with my life. At first, I would play like 10 hours a day since my parents worked all day so as soon as I got back from school I would play the rest of the day and do nothing else, not even homework. I was a top-of-the-class student but ever since I got into PC Gaming my notes eventually fell off so HARD. Only doing the bare minimum to be able to pass grades and focus on gaming. I dropped out of college at 18 to get a job and build my dream PC. I built my PC and have been playing constant League of Legends every day for 5+ hours a day. I do not even enjoy gaming anymore, I am super toxic and competitive and all I do is get mad and keep playing. I was so afraid of quitting League because I was very good and I felt so bad because I dedicated so many hours into this game to just quit and waste all that time without accomplishing anything or become a pro player. I have worked in about 15 Call centers because they pay really well and have not lasted more than 1 month or 2. I am basically there for the free training money and that is it. I quit the job and continue to play until I run out of my saved money.I have not played league for 1 month and I do not really miss it, I am just super sad that I wasted my time and League just goes on without me like I never really existed. I have moved to FPS games because I was very good when I was young but I am having a really hard time since I am getting so mad due to being super competitive. Last year I got into College again and got a part-time job, it all fell apart in the last 3 months because I wanted to play AGAIN. I have now built a new SUPER PC and I feel so miserable. :(Right now I managed to land a very good job, chill work from home only answering customer service emails. The sad part is after work is done, I game until 12AM and repeat the cycle. The idea of quitting video games is just so frightening and I feel like I need them. I am addicted to competitive esports trying to prove I am better.... , do not really play single-player games since I do not get to compete with other people. Please help me see the light out of this tunnel, I know I have the potential to become someone great but the lack of motivation and cycle of gaming addiction is blocking me off. Help me quit gaming",0
"First off: English are not my first language and this post could be a little longer.Writing this feels kind of surreal but I think i need to get it off my chest.I was diagnosed with depressive and social anxiety disorder like a year ago.(Went to therapy)My gf and i broke up with , like 2 months ago. I feel so empty now, the first week after the breakup was not so bad, just weird.But like right now I am pretty close to the edge.I am a failure, got no motivation to doe anything.(shower, work out etc.)It was a relationship of 1,5 years and I just feel like something was ripped out of me.All my happiness, my motivation, my will to live and everything else that made me happy is gone now.She already has a new one.I deleted all of her pics yesterday and it hurt me so much to think about the time with her.I tild myself yesterday:If this doesbt get better in 2022, I am killing myselfI know it sounds harsh but, if my life is not woth living because of the everlasting pain and discomfort inside my head.then why should i keep trying?I already was in a dark place before the relationship ended but this episode is by far the worst i have ever expierienced.Thanks for listening.

"it is absolutely ruined my mental state and my entire year of 2021 so far. I got scared after the crash and did not stick to the whole ""hold"" mentality, realized I should have sold when they removed the ability to buy but I am a fucking idiot.

I work an overnight job and every morning I agonize over the pre-market of other stocks I have purchased and for the most part, only see red (I have now lost $11k). it is killing me mentally and physically. There is so much shame and regret that I cannot take it. It absolutely would have changed my life. I would have been able to afford to move out, finish my nursing degree, and actually feel like an independent adult for once. Instead, I am stuck working a job a hate living in my childhood home with no friends or girlfriend. I have not been able to focus on or enjoy anything ever since. it is all about how much money I do not have that I could have if I was not so stupid.

"Title says it all. But I am done with depression. I am already so low, so empty and unmotivated. I spend all day fighting my mind and thoughts.

"So i first posted here back when i was 19, and a few years and a pandemic later here I am, 22 years old and tbh still struggling with a lot. I do not lash out anymore or self harm or really abuse alcohol or drugs or various other things to feel something like I used to, but if i was an emotional wreck back then I am now an emotionless one. The sometimes overwhelming and always constant feelings of loneliness never left me but that is about all I feel nowadays, and even though I used to do some fucked up shit I still felt something, whether it be pain or sadness or a whole range of emotions. Now i just feel empty, and when I decided to change my life and take me off a path which was inevitably leading to suicide, I sure did not think this is where Id be today. My insecurities about being alone and having no one who cares whether it be family or friends have grown massively to the point where I have sorta just accepted that this is how its going to be. In a post I wrote back then I said i was afraid of eventually pushing everyone away, now I am afraid they are just gunna leave. People who know me see me as being better because I am no longer the guy who would get black out drunk and end up hurting himself or the ones around him, but tbh I have not sorted my issues out at all, I am just better at hiding them even better than before. Its not that I want to die, trust me I have been there and I know i never want to go back to that, but I do not want to feel like this but the thing I have no idea what to do. Back at the start I had clear issues which I could deal with better (e.g do not abuse alcohol at every opportunity), but now I have more different issues which are just as painful and make me just as sad. I know I am just in my own head and its not real but honestly I do not even know anymore. I think I am pretty good at picking up on things and that coupled with my fucked up thoughts all in my head create scenarios and illusions, but it gets harder and harder to tell what is real and what is not, and so ultimately I guess I have been through so much pain and hurt that i just automatically have accepted I am alone and no one truly cares about me just to end that suffering, and it just sucks a lot. Sometimes i wonder if life was better back when i was too fucked up and unstable to care about who loves me or whatever, because I did not plan on living much longer, or if I actually successfully killed myself, then none of this would matter. But suicide is not an option and its not like i do not want to feel better and feel loved but i do not see any light at the end of this tunnel just empty, lonely darkness. Lost Soul",1

Does anyone know of something I can do or where I can go to take off work and focus on my physical and mental health? Escape from my day to day life",0

"In September I was finally planning a wedding with my SO (the person depressed) of 3 years. He spent weeks picking out the perfect ring, and he even picked out a house to buy for us. He was going to put the deed in both of our names, but take on the loan in his own since I did not graduate with my doctorate until this May. Fast forward to February when his family fell apart when his Dad (and his best friend other than me) hurt his mom (in addition to other difficulties in his life not involving me). It was like someone flipped the switch off in his brain. He said he felt numb. Like a piece of him died inside. It continued to get worse until it felt like he hated me. He said mean things, would hang out with people he never hung out with before and seem truly happy, but when he got home he was emotionless again. He did not talk. He lost interest in sex and if we did have sex it felt cold and emotionless. He assured me he still loved me but it did not feel like it anymore. In the first week of May he seems to perk up and finally opened up about feeling depressed and I left for 2 nights to go visit family and he went right back to numb. I texted him and went off because I could not take it anymore and asked him to fight for me but he said he could not. A few days later he told me we fell out of love. I recently heard about anhedonia and it seems consistent with a lot of his sudden actions and ability to have excitement with only some people. I do not expect to get back together, but some kind of understanding of an issue that I do not understand or personal experiences would be appreciated. I am struggling but in a different way. I tried to be enough, but I regret not realizing he may have needed professional help. I know this is for those with depression, but I could use some advice",0

I have seen 3 therapists in my life had them try put me back on pills and I refused, exposed secrets to my family, and showed a lack of interest in my pain.

"Any form of intimacy gives me severe nausea. To describe it in detail, you know that feeling you get when you are about to throw up? Your saliva is basically the consistency of water and you feel something being thrown up your esophagus? that happens, but i never throw up. i get on the verge of vomiting but it never comes. this would in turn lead to a racing thoughts, shortness of breath, and every other symptom of anxiety you can think of. This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was (talking, cuddling, kissing, or having sex), but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her (and have nothing go on between us) made me sick to my stomach, and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means, in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute (when the nausea happened i would step out of the room/car and walk around taking deep breaths) and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time, though. sometimes it was a little, other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all. Now, after breaking up with her a few months ago i have had multiple opportunities to even just hang out with a woman platonically 1 on 1 and i completely avoid it because it freaks me the fuck out. i do not want to have any form of intimacy anymore because i know how anxious and nauseous i will get. It just sucks because I am comfortable with like sending nudes and stuff and that is about it. i feel like such an asshole for even doing that because i know i will not be able to go any further than that. I get this problem with other things too, like eating and going on vacation, as well as being deathly scared of smoking and drinking, but this particular situation is where it gets the most intense and the most frequent. I am on Prozac for my anxiety, if that is any additional information that may help. this whole thing has spiraled me into a deep pit of self consciousness and even self hatred. I have had countless nights just lying awake thinking about what is wrong with me and why i cannot justenjoy life the way i want without having to be controlled by the way my stomach decides to act one day. I do not need a solution as soon as possible, i just need a place to start in order to fix me.

"I just had a good day with friends at the beach yet I am left tired, drained, annoyed, and not really happy at the end of the day. I feel like my negative self comes to ruin things like this all the time. A nice day at the beach, oh too many seagulls and flies and kids screaming. A nice walk around the park by myself, oh but I am alone and no one is walking with me making me feel self conscious. A night out at bars with a friend, but she is talking to another friend with us more and she is talking about how they hung out the other day which makes me think I am a lesser friend. Its draining and exhausting when the negatives always come first on good days like these. I just really want to enjoy life more without all these swirling naggy thoughts in my head. And of course I know that that takes motivation to retrain my brain into thinking more positively, motivation I barely have to do anything else- it takes a lot for me to do my hobbies and things I like to do. But that is a whole other thing. I am just sad over myself being sad and negative. I just want to be content and happy and I feel like that is not too much to ask. Always negative",0
"Its horrifying that being sad has come to be treated as a mental disorder.Now you have people in horrible circumstances that are being told the reason they feel terrible is because their brains do not work good. And that they need therapy and medication to fix their disorder. Which in reality is just sadness at how awful their lives are.You have parents who make their children have awful lives, and then when the children become sad the parents go to the doctor and get a handy diagnosis and drugs and therapist for the emotional problems that they caused. And they are told ""it is not your fault your child's brain chemistry does not work correctly."" And hundreds of thousands of people make careers profiting off this horrific scam. Telling sad, lonely people that the reason they feel bad is because they have a disease of the brain. My life was ruined by the mental health industry. There should be no treatment of social anxiety or depression as if they are curable diseases like cancer. What an awful world and predatory people. Mental health industry is criminal",0

All aspects of my life are fulfilled rn and I have everything physical that I could want (which I do not want a lot so that part is easy) , financially secure, have pets that I love, have a job I love, have a partner, and a part of me feels like that is making life worse. Cos I have no wants or needs right now but I still feel like not being here. I just do not see a point. I feel like my only purpose in life is to make others be happy or do anything that I can to make their life better but it still is not helping much.I just daydream about not being here anymore. There is a quote that I read: Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. and that is all that I hope for these days.

I feel like I just went through their evaluation by other MDs a year ago and now they sent a whole package of information for me and my doctor to complete. I am so tired of life I need to be out of work. I lost my job because of mental and physical health and there is nothing to go back to. How can they do this evaluation again? What if my doctors do not say the correct things on the forms. I am shaking with fear because the only way I am surviving is on disability and I was ready to end my life before they took me out of work. I just cannot do it. I am so tired and afraid.

"Currently 22. Life keeps getting progressively getting worse. Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS, lots of friends, a girlfriend who loved me, good family life, confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance, she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression, have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things, joined a fraternity, went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school, just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 2-3 people I would consider friends, both at home and in school. Now I am a 22 year old sophomore.Troubles with the law and an accidental overdose in the past 2 years have just made things worse both mentally and in my day to day life. On probation, so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture (I go to a party/sports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95% of the social life ) Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem. At least then I had confidence and the motivation to go out and at least make the effort to improve my life. Now I just sit in my apartment/room all day. do not have motivation to try and make new friends because of how many times I have failed at it and a lack of self esteem. Tried countless therapists and different antidepressants. Just feel stuck, and I do not know what to do anymore. Just going through the motions. Life keeps getting worse",0
"I have been debating making a post here but today I told myself I need to share in hopes of helping anyone struggling like I have. Quick backstory. Been majorly depressed since I was 16. On and off anti depressants and anti anxiety meds, sleeping pills etc. Had an unsuccessful suicide attempt at 17. Out patient psychiatric care, therapy, social work..it goes on. Mother was diagnosed with cancer when I was 16 and shortly after became terminal. She passed when I was 24 but between 16-24 was a roller coaster of hell. Pretty much decided I would die when she died. That did not happen. I was faced with the reality of life and realized I had another chance.Cut to today..I am 29 and I have a beautiful 4 year old daughter. I recently got a job at a cafe and have been on Effeczor for a few months. Its really helping. I finally feel some progress and some positivity.I have felt completely hopeless and worthless and cold in my past. So lost, so dark and just did not give a fuck about anything. Loosing my mother and gaining a daughter showed me how precious life is and how easily lost it can be. I know you and I see you. I am you. I am sure if I were in one of my depressive episodes I would read this and say ew. Lol. But please remember you are worth it. You have a purpose. You are loved. If by no one then I love you and please do not give up.I promise there is a way out for you and do not stop fighting for yourself.Reach out and get well.Thanks for letting me share. Hello friends!

"Through the journey of life, I have experienced more than enough for multiple people at once. More than what seems anyone can expect. I have never had a ""stable"" life, even throughout my childhood. Abuse was always rampant, no matter where I went. From home to school it was always the same. Lost a lot of loved ones along the way, whether natural, suicide, or overdose. It was all the same. I am prone to survivors remorse, but only because I have tried 7 times unsuccessfully. I have been to numerous psychologists and psychiatrists for different treatment and different medicines but to no avail it seems.

"Over the past few years alot if shit has happened to me and i have a decent bit of trauma built up, to the point where it is painful to even think about them during the time that they had started happening i moved in with my dad who had previously walked out on me for a few years. While i was in the house i thought i could finally catch a break but I did not, i felt like an object, not a human let alone a son every night i was not even allowed close the door and my room was the storage room I was barely allowed my phone and i was not even allowed to have a call that was not him or my mother which made me feel worse, every day if i screwed up even in the slightest i had a 2-4 hour long lecture, i was told i have no purpose, i was told I am not going to make it in life, i was told that i will not make it to college and i was told that I am worth absolutely nothing. Everything just went downhill one day and it has not risen at all I have hit rock bottom and I am somehow going deeper and at this point I cannot with life anymore to the point where i have even made a deadline for myself for when i kill myself.

I have even decided by the time I am out of school I am going to cut everyone and everything off just to prepare for the day that it happens I am even going to do it in a different country to make sure that they do not even find out about it and everyday i think to myself it will be better in the next life. I have not cared about anyone's feelings in years and i barely have them myself i throw up a facade any time i talk to people i even have it up online the only time i let it down is when I am in bed crying myself to sleep on a daily basis.

"Covid did a real number on me In terms of my mental health, for the past year and a half I have felt isolated, lonely, self conscious etc. I have begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking to help at times with boredom/sadness and I am only 16. I have been on my meds since December and they have helped in ways but its still so difficult to keep going. Today I woke up to both my mom and brother panicking that they could not find our cat of four years. Our first cat we have ever had and she is been with us for so many journeys and has been a loving companion. We live on a farm with many outdoor cats but we would not let our indoor cats out as often because they did not mingle well with the others. Well our indoor cat, she got out last night because of me. Because I am too selfish and greedy that I could not leave it for one night and had to go smoke, my dumbass left the door open and she left at some point. we have searched all day to no avail, I can tell my brother resents me for this I understand what hes feeling but it still does not take away the pain nor the guilt of losing her. I am not even man enough to admit that I was smoking and that is why she got out. My mom keeps telling me this is a natural part of life and that she suspected that she may have been sick anyways, still does not hurt any less. I have been suicidal for a little while now but to chicken to do anything about it but honestly this was the last thing I needed and it may have been the thing to push me over the edge. I am just so sad and miss her so much already. I do not know if I am going to do it but I am just so done with life and all the shit that is been thrown my way.

I was not even obligated to help her. She messaged me needing help but she would grow feelings for me. She was sooo scared. Losing me, me ghosting her etc. She was the sweetest person ever. I fell so badly for her. Now she is gone. I could never proof how much she meant to me. Anything i tried was turned down. I was depressed before and she pulled me out of that. Now after she is gone I am completely alone again and from ultra happy to ultra depressed. My self coinfidence is zero right now. I can talk to some people, but none of them are true friends. Is this what i get for helping people and being genuine with everything to her?Crushed enough that I want to die? Is this what this whole fucking world has to offer? Yeah, nothing is perfect and you should not have expectations, but geez. She even thought i would waste myself anyway it seems. Nonsense. I only feel that way when she did not say anything. And now. I feel numb. I feel not being able to sleep. My breathing is heavy and my pulse is elevated constantly. I have panic attacks when someone messages me (yeah)I do not feel any motivation.

"I have never been so close to just ending my life. I have been unable to walk for over a year, and just got another job again. However, my left leg is not doing so well and I will probably need surgery. I have had multiple surgeries on my right knee, got denied workmans compensation, and eventually lost my job because my FMLA was up. A few weeks ago, my girlfriend left me for someone else and all I want to do is take the leftover percocet I have from my operations. I did everything for her and bent over backwards, always there for her when she was suicidal, but when I told her how I felt she left me and said ""good luck"". Discarded like a used fucking tampon. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for about 14 years now and every day just brings me closer. Work in 5 hours and I cannot sleep, I am not sure what to do, guys. I have nobody and I keep telling myself being alone is okay, but sometimes it is not. I felt like I was making so much progress with my trust issues, but she fucked it up so bad. I am so tempted to take these pills, guys. Even if I did kill myself, she still would not care. She left me to die, no remorse. I still have some goals, but if my body keeps breaking and I am not able to obtain them... I just do not know anymore. Rock bottom.",0

My mental health has been destroyed for the past 16 years of my life. I grew up always having dreams about what I want to do in the future but I am stuck in a life where I am not allowed to have any control over myself. This kind of pain hurts worse than not being able to control my own life. I cannot wait to turn 18 and recover from the life I am being forced to live or die in the process. I cannot wait for people to give me my fucking freedom forever. I hate being 17,0

2 years of depersonalization/derealisation and depression and suicidal thoughts. It has not gotten better and I now hate myself and I know I will not ever like myself again. I have become a robot. I cannot even talk or look any family members in the eyes. Friends do not understand the dpdr side. It hurts because I have only opened up to two people about it who are my friends and one said he thought he had it and it was not that bad and the other asked if I am imagining it all this going on and I have to decide my future now. I am going into college in a month and have to pick a job and all. Antidepressants not working and I have gotten fat and cannot even care. Only reason I live is because if I did not it would because my family pain and I am very grateful that my family loves me even though most of them do not love eachother but I do not even deserve their love. I hate myself for past mistakes and believe I do not ever deserve love or happiness but sometimes think death is an easy way out and think maybe living and suffering would be a better punishment for me. Idk life is so hard I just slept most of the day today. I have not even had the energy to socialize anymore. I never really had it but I forced myself to but now I cannot even do that. I think old friends think I am Just being rude and do not like them but its not even true. No one even takes me seriously anyway I am just a joke of the group who they think is so stupid because I just laugh and nod if it gets to awkward and can never say what I actually want to. Whatever though I really want to live a happy life and forgive myself but I know its impossible No relief,0

"I spent what feels like an entire lifetime as a paramedic, and over the course of a decade of working in public safety I have seen and been through some extraordinary circumstances. I took pride in my career, loved every minute of it, and miss it every day. For the past three years my life has been ripped apart by moments, ones that are seemingly and endlessly stacked one on top of the other, that I thought I would never- ever experience. I was blindsided by a brutal divorce with my ex three years ago who has since ruined my reputation, continues to use an incredibly immoral backdrop narrative in the courts against me, and is relentless in her attempts to make my life worse every day. **Bad karma, right?** A year and a half ago I lost my career, I was getting brutalized in this horrendous divorce, and my parenting rights were stripped from me. I entered into a horrendously depressive state, and I knew that I needed to get help. So- that is exactly what I did. Just like every patient (hundreds if not thousands over a decade) that I had taken to the hospital for mental health dilemmas- I checked myself into the hospital during my absolute worst moments. is not it funny how... in the worst of moments- everybody in your life wants to be there, wants to be the hero, wants to help... but when the chaos has passed all those same people are nowhere to be found? You only gain that perspective when it all unfolds in front of you, and I still shake my head at that realization. Some remain, but even those that have still view me in a different light.After my stay in the hospital, I was committed to getting my life back together. I found a therapist who has helped me immensely, I got sober from alcohol completely, and all I wanted was to have my daughter back.The stigma of it all, and those single moments of me reaching out for help by going to the hospital, have followed me endlessly in my child custody battle. Despite doing everything that the PC attached to our case has asked me to do- I still do not have my daughter back with me in any significant amount of time. I am still run over by my exs brutal tactics in court, and nothing I achieve, or gain seems to make any difference. That single hospital stay has ruined the most important pieces of my life- and that is being a father to my daughter.I used to tell patients all the time that going to the hospital to get help would only make things better for them. I used to believe that. I want to still believe that. But.....**Where the hell is my karma?** Because I am starting to think this karma thing is no longer working for me. The stigma of mental health permeates every subtle conscious thought of those who start to look at you differently. Like you are completely alone in a crowded room. Like you are broken somehow... like damaged goods. You might be better, but the stigma remains. It has followed me like a shadow that I cannot get rid of, and all I want is to feel proud of addressing my mental health. I want to feel like I was honest when I told my patients to do the same thing. I want to be a success story for my daughter- showing the kind of strength it takes to overcome these painful obstacles. I want to feel like if I could redo it all over again- I would still do it the same way because I put in the work to heal myself from the worst of my moments. It has been a year and a half where my daughter is barely with me, and there is no logical reason for that except a subjective bias. The stigma of it all- it feels never ending, and all because I sought help. I am stuck in an absolute nightmare that I cannot wake up from.If the stigma follows you as it does me- know that you are not alone. You are NOT alone. It Is The Stigma That Has Ruined Me",0
"I do not think anyone will care or see this, as is not uncommon on Reddit, but I need to say. I love my parents. I could not break their hearts. My family is precious. But the thing REALLY keeping me alive is my baby dog, Ellie. She is almost a year and my baby. I love her so much and know that she would not understand. She would miss me singing to her, or walking her at 12:30 everyday. Nobody knows what every little bark means the way I can. And I could not take that from her. It would not be right to bring a dog in and die. My Dog Keeps Me Alive",1
"I am 41. Not sure exactly how I got here but I honestly feel cursed by god or the universe or whatever forces are at work. I have felt depressed for about 25 years now. And before that, as a child I felt different, weird, isolated, and alienated. I was 18 before seeking real help, when someone at my university asked me ""Have you ever considered killing yourself?"" and it occurred to me that that was not normal. I have been on most of the major antidepressants. I have been hospitalized twice. I have seen countless doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists and still I am in the same place. I have reached out to TMS and Ketamine places but have not gotten anywhere. I have tinnitus and have taken a number of blows to the head throughout my life but never been sure if its related to the depression. I have a supportive family and even a great wife and I feel terrible for relying on them so much financially and emotionally while not being able to make progress. My main problem seems to be that I do not feel like I am a part of anything that is going on. I do not understand what is going on. I do not know what I am supposed to be doing. Everything seems wrong and all I see is chaos and confusion. I am honestly trying my best to survive and thrive but it just keeps getting worse. I went to college because I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. Now I barely even enjoy films or it feels like every idea has been done. I knew I could not network or assemble a crew or any of the necessary things I would have to do. The most I was ever able to do was to make wedding videos.and hire maybe 1 other person. I decided to stop doing that, got a job editing short promos for TV shows which gave me a portfolio no one seems to care about. Worked for local government creating media before getting fired for voicing concerns about noise in the office because I am so sensitive. Then with no one hiring me, I had to go back to driving which I have done ever since I was able to work. I used to think driving made me feel free and I could be alone with music, podcasts, and my thoughts, but now I do not want to be alone with my thoughts because all I think about is killing myself all day. For two years, I transported dead bodies which was super depressing. Now I work for FedEx and its hot, noisy, and extremely strenuous. Every time someone tries to help me with a job prospect it leads nowhere, to the point where I do not even want to accept the help. I have been rejected from so many places that it seems I would be qualified for. I look for jobs all the time and they all look really bad or do not pay much. And the process takes so much time only to be rejected at the end. I want to quit my job but only have spotty gig work to fall back on. I feel like a failure and that I cannot contribute financially.I do feel gratitude for the things I have. I have tried journaling, meditation, yoga, exercise, and plenty of the other things people suggest you do. But my mind stays locked on past mistakes and cringey moments. I beat the shit out of myself all day everyday and cannot stop. I compare myself to others, get jealous, and get angry that I cannot be normal or successful. And it feels like I am getting dumber, more forgetful, and harder of hearing when I need to have all my faculties working as well as possible. It just seems I am getting older and my life gets more sad and embarrassing. I barely want to leave the house because I am sensitive to the horrible things I see or situations I might end up in.I do not know what to do anymore. I am scared of getting older and how it could possibly get even worse. I need help but I cannot seem to get it. Everything is out of reach. Everything seems impossible. I have tumbled down for a long time and see no way back up",0
I am in so much emotional pain and I have no one to talk to. I cannot even talk if I wanted to. I do not see anyway out of this Pain,0
"I am 16, I have been thinking about ending it all every hour of every day for the last 2 weeks. Usually its very passive and its just in the back of my head but lately it seems to be very in my face? Its very hard to explain but for the most part all I can think about its how or when I am going to end it all. I was raised to be emotionless so I am very secretive about how I am feeling on the inside and show no emotion on the outside so my parents do not even know I am even thinking about killing myself, hell they do not even know I am sad and lonely. I have been mostly socially isolated since I was around 11 due to my parents feeling it was necessary for me to be home schooled due to severe bullying (I was severely injured by a group of older students, so I can kind of see why?) but it was mainly my dads decision with my mom not liking the idea, even though I stated multiple times on how I feel homeschooling is a mistake and will only lead to failure, 4 years later and now it feels like ill never be able to fit into society again, I mean I have completely forgotten how to talk to people. This year I have convinced my mom to put me back in due to my ""dad"" not being as close to the family. But at what cost? All I want now is death, plain and simple. All I know is I am not living past the age of 21, It feels as if I am destined to kill myself, no other ways out I must take my own life to escape this hell. I know even later on in life that if my mother dies its all over for me, so why even give birth to me in the first place?I have argued with my mom about how you should not have children if you are incapable of giving them a good childhood and she usually uses the same bullshit excuse of ""Well I know I could not be a good mom back then so now I will try to be a good mom now"" No, those were meant to be the best years of my life, before I had responsibilities before I was even thinking about the future. For those who are wondering my Mom and Dad divorced pretty young in my life, I mean so early on that I do not even fucking remember them being together. Something about my dad having some mental health issues and being extremely violent but even still they stayed in contact due to them obviously having to ""take care of me and my 2 older siblings"". Now for most of my early years whenever my mother had a problem with how I was acting instead of dealing with it herself she would just drop me off at my fathers house and let him deal with it. Now not to mention that his shitty old house was filled with bugs to the point where I could not sleep and had reoccurring nightmares about small little bugs crawling all over me and I would wake up in a panic. Not to mention he was pretty verbally abusive. Pretty much the average shitty father shebang. There is a lot of what hes said to me and done to me that I never told my mom and kept inside and I still do. I mean for example one of the things hes said to me is ""If you turn out to be some gay disappointment I will crush your fucking skull and I do not care if I go to prison because it will be better then knowing that I raised a shitbag"" Keep in mind I was 11 years old, and well it obviously worked because I am extremely afraid of even being friends with other guys. I have so much pent up sadness and anger that I just simply cannot express due to me not knowing how and being a emotionless person for so long. If I would have known back then that I could have called someone to get me out of this shithole I would have back then but now there is not even much of a point because the damage has already been done.I have never gotten therapy or anything because I never said anything because I was so young I did not understand what any of this meant and since it was so long ago I do not know how to bring up this trauma and all of this other feelings of sadness and guilt with my mother because for 1. How are you meant to bring something like that up to the same person who somewhat caused it, and 2. I would not even know how to bring something like that up because of my outwards image as a emotionless zombie. Which has lead to me seriously hurting myself mentally and psychically by cutting. I mean there is truly 0 hope, victim of obvious child abuse, lacking in education, socially inept there is is no way out I have 0 future. I mean I love my mom, she is changed so much in the last 2 years after she found out what my dad did to my older brother and has cut him out of our lives so I am not mad at her I just cannot trust her. I know I must die soon. I know all its going to take is for one thing to go wrong and then I am done, ill make that impulse decision and kill myself. Honestly my thoughts on death have changed so much since I was young. It went from ""holy shit I do not want to die"" to ""holy shit can someone fucking kill me already?"" I have already tried to overdose on Benadryl off of a impulse decision after a argument with my mom, rushed to hospital blah blah idk why anyone would try to save me but its still funny how my mom still did not question how I would even accidently take that much which just shows that nobody fucking cares. I have already planned how I will kill myself when I am feeling that impulse decision, I will take my belt and hang myself. Due to me being able to take some amount of psychical pain from me cutting myself I am sure I can handle that 2 minutes before I pass out from lack of oxygen. I mean the more and more I think about it the more appealing it sounds. I get to feel nothing! You know how awesome that sounds? I wish I could feel nothing today, unable to think or do just relax. I have not been relaxed in such a long time I would kill just to not feel tense. I do not think I have gotten more then 6 hours of sleep for the last couple of months which is just slowly driving me up the fucking wall. I am becoming more and more easily frustrated at the smallest things, I mean I got mad at not being able to find my razor to hurt myself its gotten so bad. I will fucking end it soon, I have lost the fear of death and now I am somewhat determined to kill myself. If I cannot hang myself then I will endure the pain until I am 21, buy a gun and will not fucking hesitate to blow my brains out the instant I come home that day. Its weird how I am not mad at anyone but myself, I ware my self down on everything. &amp;#x200B;I have been alone for so long, do I even want death? do I want to just escape from the problems? I just want a hug man, I just want someone that i can just fucking hug and cry and tell them all of my problems. I have too much trust issues with my mom to do that and my siblings are all way older then me and I have never been super close to them. I have never been super close to anyone i have never felt loved by someone not even myself what is the fucking point? it just sucks knowing that ill die a nobody fucking loser but its not like i can change it. sucks knowing that ill probably not make it past 2023 but who cares anymore everything becomes irrelevant when you are faced with death. if there is a higher being that decided they were going to give me a shit life then ill be the higher being to fucking take it away. abused early in life and feeling unloved. I want to fucking die. I have no future.",1
"Idk, it feels like I have been living through the same kind of day for the last year. I feel broken, I have no motivation to take care of myself, to do any basic chore or even try to do college assignments.Even still, the assignments of the last year have pilled up and fell on my head at once. I do not enjoy a single of my hobbies left, I have to force myself to actually play games again, or read. I used to love this shit and would spend unhealthy amounts of hours enjoying myself... How tf did I break so fkn hard.I have lost touch with most friends I used to care about, I cannot stand the sight of my family anymore even if I used to love them so much. I just do not see a way, a reason to keep going on. Do I have to keep on for 40+ years just so I do not make the people around me sad?Would anyone feel sad? I feel like if I disappeared most people I know would feel indifferent...The for reading if you made it this far, I do not really expect a response or advice, I would love some if available, but the main point of this post was to clear my head a bit.

"Posting this here to see if anyone feels the same or knows what the fuck is wrong with me.I know this is extremely fucked up but I for some reason want my life to be extremely worse. Sometimes I will see people talk about feeling depressed and suicidal from as young as 5-6 years old and I will get jealous (I have been depressed since I was 9, I am 15 now.)I will see people talk about attempting suicide from as young as 11 and I will feel jealous. And I think, the worst of all is, I will see people talk about being sexually abused as a kid AND I GET JEALOUS. I think if i went to therapy and discoved that I was sexually assaulted and had just buried the memories i would be happy. I know its fucked up and I know that all of these situations are very serious but my stupid head makes me jealous of people having shittier lives than mine. I am so self destructive and I am not sure why. I fucking hate myself for feeling this way, people have actually been in these situations and here i am wishing it were me. I have planned before to get into abusive relationships in hopes that i would be abused.Is it because I think people will care more?Is it because i want to relate to people?Is it because it might finally encourage me to end it all?Do I just want some kind of sob-story so people will feel bad for me?When ever my mom sees me showing any negative emotions she lectures me, talking about how she and other people have it so much worse than me. It makes me feel like being depressed is some sort of competition, I literally got lectured for being annoyed at my cat today. Do i want my life to be worse so she will care about me or so my friends will care about me?I am so sorry for thinking this way but i cannot make it stop. I just want it to stop. Why do I want my life to be worse",1

The saddest part is I know how to do it successfully because the nights I am left alone, I am alone for a while. do not have many ppl to reach out that would respond immediately. Too ashamed to talk to anyone I know about it. I am just scared. In need of a support system I feel like I am out of options. Work and my dog are the only things keeping me alive right now.

I am 16 and going to be a junior soon and I feel completely lost and like an overall waste of space. My gpa went down because of covid and compared to everyone else I feel like nothing. Everyone says that grades are not important and that they do not matter but how?? I have based my entire life around them and tried my hardest and to know that I still failed in the end and that everything I have worked for did not matter. I feel terrible about it. I feel like I have failed everyone. Especially my parents. I do not know what to do. I hate that I am not amazing like my friends or my cousin who does all these amazing things and still has great grades while I am struggling to wakeup and not end it all if I step back into school. I just feel lost. I want to disappear. I am so sick and tired of crying and feeling guilty for everything that I have done in my life. I do not know what to do. I feel completely lost,0
I have reached out to so many who I have done wrong and even to those who have done wrong to me and forgiven them. I am so so tired of trying. I am tired of trying for another year for trying to be better for my family for trying to be better I am tired. I know no one will respond to this I know that very few people respond to my things and that is fine I am just another person in a giant world. I am not expecting forgiveness and they should not expect forgiveness from me I guess what I wanted was connection. Someone to see me for more than who I have been and for who I want to be. I just cannot do it anymore I am reaching 26 in America that means that you have to be on your own you pay for your own health insurance even if you cannot afford it and I cannot afford it. No one has ever been in love with me I have not had friends in years in my own family cannot stand me. And honestly I do not think anyone will read this I am putting out here to say and I am planning to end it that I will end it before I am 26 that I will no longer be a burden on my family. I cannot do this anymore the world is ending the earth is dying and humans do not care about each other and how to fix it. So if people do not even care about the planet they are living on how can I expect him to care about one of the billions who lives on it. I cannot I am nothing I will be only one amongst millions who have come before me and dies forgotten. I do not even quite know what I have done wrong other than being born a girl that is stupid and ugly and fat. I hope so many of you find love and happiness and purpose. I hope no one ever feels the way I do. I hope but I am tired. I am tired.,1
"I am overdue for a haircut and with everything going on in my life I really want to shave my head. Some unnecessary info about me: I am 21F. Overweight (last time I checked I was nearing 230). If I kept going with my diet Id probably be at my goal weight right now. So I am trying to do somehow lose weight again (eat less, drink more). Part of the reason why I added some info about me is the reason why I have not done it yet is because I am not only insecure but I dress like a guy so if I shave my head completely Id actually look like a guy. Hahaha I know it will get better but damn I have been in a slump for weeks now. Also, one of the main reasons why I want to shave my head is because of the bugs. They get caught in my hair and I hate it. I have short hair already and its getting long so I am kind of tempted to get rid of it all. Plus its a good way to start fresh.

Iv planned my suicide after destroying my life and losing the last thing I had left. My beautiful ex. She thinks I am bpd but idk(m23). I am too scared to reach out in case they put me into some sort of place. she is the only one who is cared about me and I am just a mentally unstable alcoholic with nothing but debt and no job.

"For a little background information I have been severely depressed or all most a year now. I have been to several therapists, been on multiple medications but it all has had little to no change in my depression. To put it bluntly I am just tired of living tired of feeling sad, lonely,lost, hopeless tired of I all. I see no point in trying to get help when nothing is working. I am think I am ready to leave the world honestly. I am about to be a senior in high school and the thought of having to go throw a nother year of online school makes me will not to vomit. I do not think I can do that again I rather drop out but I know I cannot so the next best thing is-well I am sure you know. I am just tired of it all",0
"Does anyone here have FMLA for depression? Is that a thing? Over time, I have discovered that working full-time really triggers my depression. I feel like it makes life pointless. Like what is the purpose of working 40+ hours a week just to pay your mortgage/bills? Then you have no time for yourself. But without the full-time job, you have no health insurance, and not enough money to do anything in your spare time. Makes absolutely no sense to me. When everything was shut down during coronavirus, I felt so much better. I was even able to get off meds I had time to cook and eat well, to get proper sleep, and just to focus on and take care of myself. Then I went back to work 3 days a week for about the past year and everything was still fairly good. I was managing that ok. But, I recently had to go back to working 40 hours, and the downward spiral has already begun. Its only been a couple weeks, and I already feel like shit. I do not even want to get out of bed anymore :( Working makes me depressed",0
I am 24. No career.No proper degree. Bad college grades due to constant mental health issues with no support.Was preparing for an exam hard. Finally gaining motivation. GF broke up abruptly just a month before exam. Affected me badly. Failed in the exam. No money to retake it. No one to talk to. It looks like an endgame to me.I cannot escape this. No escape.,0
"Most of us were born out of wedlock. Growing up with a lack of basic needs that are not tended to and even those who were planned still end up having a shitty life! Outside of that we have society on our necks about ""being happy"" ""chasing dreams"" when in reality people are struggling to just live! Homelessness is high, drug and alcohol addiction is high, suicide rates are rapidly rising. I will never bring a being into this shithole we call life. Humans are self centered and delusional end of story!!!!! No wonder there are so many addicts in the world. No wonder suicide rates are skyrocketing. No wonder this world is full of chaos and misery.",0
I am going to kill myself. I am not saying that for attention. I want to kill myself but I am too scared to do it because I feel like I will regret it but I am failing school and I have so much exams and I need to do a presentation in front of my class and I am so fucking nervous I cannot deal will life anymore I am not a hard worker and I hope the other side is better where I do not have to do anything School is too stressful for me,1
"As i lay in my bed,Filled with hate, fear and dread,I ask, o Lord,Let me leave this rotten head.It brings no pleasure,No joy or pride,To sit alone,And cry.""So why?""I ask,""Am i forbiden,To be forgiven,To think,That this might change.That some day in the future,I will not be deranged?""But still i lay in my bed,Thinking of the color red.I might be better off dead,A head filled with led.But sleep comes easily now,Once this is off my chest.I will meet you all next time,When the thoughts'll come out to test. A poem",1
"I open my eyes. 7:45 AM. it is time to get up. I wash my hands. I wash my face. I am hungry. The fridge is full of spider web. The wind is blowing in there. There is a pile of bills on the table. I hear a quarrel. it is my mother, talking on the phone. I listen closely. It seems my father has no intent on paying the alimony. My mother cannot work - health issues. We will not be able to make ends meet. I need to consume my scholarship again. I will call the dentist at 9 to quit my appointment. Classic.I open my eyes. The online university is about to go down. Here comes the autumn. I need to keep my grades up at the top. I will lose my scholarship and my dorm otherwise. it is already life-draining, but not enough. I need to start looking for a job. There is no other way I will survive moving out of my town.I open my eyes. There is a mirror. I am naked. I can see the acne dominating my face, my body. There is no panicking and no stress into getting rid of it. The scars and deformities already took everything. Is that Peyronie's disease? What about my broken tooth? Oh no, anyways. I open my eyes. I got one message. it is one of my colleagues. A differential equation is not working out. The dopamine is rising up in my brain. I am being needed. My existence matters for a moment. I am never wanted, so this is the best I can get. I solved it. She thanked me. I am no longer needed. I am now lonely. I open my eyes. I am a man. I can only like other men. I am an abomination - for my ""family"", for my ""friends"", for my colleagues, for my country, probably for the reader. I am protected tho. There is a wall between me and their hatred - my ability to hinder. Is it actually an ability? The idea of a partner is more than unrealistic. Looks do not matter, but no one wants a beast outside a tale. Personality is more important, but what is it expected for someone who grew chained up. I open my eyes. it is completely dark. I am about to go to sleep. That will not happen soon. I am thinking. I am about to finish college. I am about to break the poverty chain. My career is the only thing that went right in my life. Will I be able to start over? I am afraid. I do not want my last hope to let me down. I feel like I have lost too much in life. I feel like a second-grader at NASA. One that is expected to learn everything just by hanging around. Seems so easy for my scientist advisers, so hard for me. What about the thing about me that I cannot change? What if I will not be able to start over? Damn, thanatophobia - my savior and pain. The Lament of a Throwaway",1
"I mean why? I do not want to be suffered anymore, I do not want to be depressed, I do not want to make other people irritated and stressed..All I want is just ending my pain and leaving this terrible world. And also it will be much better for ppl around me when I leave. They will not be stressed or angry with me.I am useless and meaningless piece of shit. So I should die for everyone. If I keep leaving, everything will be much worse. Why I should live?",1
"it is been 1.5 years, i have not seen her physically in 7 months and i have not talked to her in over a year. But i had a dream yesterday she forgave me for what i did to her. Even now as i look for other women to date it all goes back to Iyanna. Beautiful funny and interesting Iyanna who i hurt so bad her unbreakable love was cracked in two. Idk how to go on these days. I hate myself, i hate my body, i cannot approach women nor can i even date them. I can barely keep the friends i have and i do not think i have many left. My life just feels empty, my work helps distract me but when I am not at work it hits me like a ton of bricks. i used to have friends to turn to when i felt like killing myself but i do not anymore. I am desperately hoping i can find a girl to keep me alive. That sounds unhealthy and it is but i do not think ill be able to live for myself much longer. I just want someone who likes me, who cares about me, who when i get off work will be there in my texts asking how my day was. A girl to wrap my arms around and hold softly, a girl to just hangout with and admire her. But I am anxious, and I am fat, and a little retarded. And its a women's game in terms of dating, i have to make the first move bc they will not and i cannot make the first move bc I am deathly afraid of them. So there in lies rhe problem. I am a good man with a steady paying job for a 18 year old and i have goals and dream, I am funny and interesting and nice and strong but none of that matters bc ill never get to the point where women see those qualities. All they see is a fat fucking retard. cannot stop thinking of her",1
"So well I got myself checked officially and turns out I am a 14 year old with (PTSD) yeah so I told my friends about this and they laughed at my face saying that I cannot have it or depression because there are people out there with worse problems (and I agree that is true). They made it seem like worthless like my mental health is not important. Whenever I reach out somehow they make fun of me saying I am 14 and I should stfu. So today I have 3 months left before I commit suicide and well I cut all my friends out from my life and I just stay curled up in my room with myself. it is fine during the day since I mostly just write or watch shows but at night it is really bad. I take pills to sleep and now I am addicted to them. I started smoking to avoid reality. I am always tired and the only way I avoid emotions is by listening to songs all the time. I used to be at my best at a time but now I am too numb to even feel, be excited. I have got no one to live for and I am worthless so yeah. Thank you for listening to my my bullshit as my ""friends"" Would call this . I am too numb and nothing interests me anymore apart from dying",0
"I am nearly 20, Male, living in the UK. Growing up I lived with my mum, my step dad, and my two half brothers. I was always an angry child, at 10-11 my mum called the police on me because she kicked me out and I smashed a window.I went to live with my dad as I was starting secondary school, he never made me do anything and allowed me to play video games all day long. I stopped washing as often and therefore started to get bullied for having greasy hair by a lot of the people I thought were my friends in primary school. Soon after I moved schools and over the next 5 years my confidence slowly increased and by the end of it I got along with nearly everybody. However during that time I spent pretty much all of my time, that I was not sleeping or in school, playing video games, to the point where I have now spent 10s of thousands of hours of my life gaming. My attendance and behavior at school gradually got worse and worse. I did not care about revising for any of my GCSEs and therefore failed most of them. After school I did not stay in contact with any of my friends. Then I went to the local college, but once again did not care about the work and skipped a lot of days to play video games. After a few months I met my ex online and soon after dropped out of college. I remember the first time I met her, I saw her walking towards me and I remember thinking she was the most beautiful person I had ever seen. Also I could see she was nervous and I felt more confident than I had ever felt in my life and every time we met then on I had the same level of confidence. However I would not meet her very often as she lived an hour away and her parents did not like me. Also after dropping out of college I started to develop social anxiety as I never went out, never met any friends, stayed in my room all day playing video games and talking to her. After a year of dating her we started to argue a lot more, she would often lie to me about things that would happen because she was scared of my reaction, and then eventually when I found out I would have a go at her and end up blocking her. She was very insecure and could not understand why I took out all my anger on her and just wanted to spend my entire day playing video games, and on top of that i accidentally got her pregnant twice and she lost them both because of stress. Towards the end the arguments seemed to happen every week and I did not realise it at the time but now I know her life must have been hell. She struggled at college, her parents were very strict, she had to sneak out and get a train to visit me, as I was too insecure to visit her, and on top of all that the person she loved would treat her like shit and prioritise gaming over spending time with her. After two years of dating her, and an argument about me getting an aquarium with my benefits money I decided to leave her. My biggest regret. I started to quit playing video games and after about a month I contacted her again and found out she had found someone new. It almost killed me, I started to drink alcohol, cut myself and spent a lot of my nights sitting on a bridge over the motorway. For two months I tried winning her back, but she lied to me and was actually dating this other guy the whole time. Over the 6 months after I left her I spent everyday drinking and was arrested 3 times and nearly sectioned 3 other times for trying to kill myself and calling the police saying I had weapons to try and have them kill me, and everytime I was handcuffed I would try smashing my head on the ground or wall because I wanted to punish myself.it is over a year later, I have been taking mirtazapine for the last 8 months. I think about her every single day and have tried contacting her so many times with fake accounts but every time I get angry that she hurt me and just end up trying to hurt her more. And if all that is not bad enough, every time I have tried to hurt her I have used every secret thing she told me she was insecure about because I wanted to hurt her as much as possible. I know this is pure evil. I now live in a caravan outside my mums house, I do not play video games anymore, I have been going to the gym everyday for the last few months, I have started to read books. I have got a few tattoos. I have tried to move forward with life and actually become a man. But since taking mirtazapine my memory has got a lot worse and I struggle to think straight. Which is good for not obsessing over my ex but how can I have a future and live if I cannot even think. And a lot of the time I do not see the point in even trying, the best case scenario is I become a man and independent but even then I know I will end up hurting more people and I just do not want to hurt anybody ever again. I just do not know what to do and my reoccurring thought is that if I kill myself than I will spare a lot of people pain in the future, and I guess to also stop myself from being hurt again. No friends, No job, No relationship. I am not a good person, I have hurt people my entire life. Is suicide righteous if it prevents more harm from being inflicted.",1
"i cannot do anything. the house smells like dog vomit, there is trash everywhere, dirty dishes in the sink. its making me feel guilty, but all I can do is lie here and cry. i just want to disintegrate into nothingness, go to sleep forever. i just want to go to sleep for a long time",0

"i do not do anything, things just happen to me. I am powerless. I cannot survive on my own, i cannot leave my house, i do not feed myself, i can barely work for a few hours sitting at a computer before getting exhausted. Exhaustion that makes the chest feel heavy and the eyes drop and I just feel like screaming. I cannot bear the responsibility of being alive, i just exist, I wake up, i look for reasons to get up, cannot find any so I just do because I am expected to, not because I really want it.Its all so taxing, so tiring. ANd to be honest I do not want to get better, I just want to rest. I do not understand where do people draw the strenght to keep waking up everyday voluntarily. Then again I have nothing to cling on. no friends, no future, no goals or ambitions and there is always the temptation and the choice to just quit. I am past the point of wanting friends. I am scared of friendships, I have not have one since middle schoolI m not going to get vaccinated. TPTB do not care about me, so why so suddenly do they want me to get a shot? its in my best interest you say? no, dying is my best interest. I already had covid back in february. I was a coward, I will not kill myself, death will come to me, like everything in life. complaining will not solve anything but I do not care, I never accomplish anything either I am not fully commited to living and never will be",1
"i cry for hours once a week or two, i lock myself in the the bathroom and cry silently, i want to scream to let the pain go, but I cannot let the family hear me, they do not accept depression, and they will just make it worse, telling me I am sick or stupid, they will just make my depression far worse, even i have a big family i still feel lonely and empty no one cares, no one want to listen to me, no one wants to do or wants me to do anything, it hurts, i wish i was not born, i wish i died when i almost drowned, when i was on that Field trip to the water park, I am too coward to end my life, i hate myself. Am i the only one who burst out crying once a week or two?",0
"Good evening all. 2 Mondays ago I went to the ER for a kidney stone. Went on to work afterwards and everything was ok. That next morning my side was hurting from it so I took one of the Percocets they prescribed me, took off work, and went back to bed. My daughter sleeps with my wife and I and she sbuggked up with me (she is 2 1/2 years old) and I had a dream that I hurt her somehow. When I woke up the first thing I thought was oh my god, I could never do that. Since then, I have been incredibly disconnected from life. I stopped taking them officially this last Sunday so they have been out of my system for about a week. But, the depression is still here and I have never experienced it before in my life. I feel weird around my wife and daughter. I have thought about just driving my car into a tree as fast as I can to make it all go away. I feel like I do not love anyone anymore and nothing seems to bring me enjoyment. All I sit and think about is when is this all going to go away? And days JUST DRAG ON now. I am barely eating and barely sleeping. I mentioned the Percocets because I have been told this is classic Percocet deoendabxy withdrawal and just how easy it is to become addicted to them with a regular week dosage from the Dr. But, I cannot seem to move past this. I have managed to keep the dark thoughts out but my enjoyment is gone. I laugh at jokes sure. But.... I am absolutely lost. it is as if I look at my wife and daughter and wonder who they are. I feel like the need to protect my little one is suddenly gone. I know I love them both but that exciting feeling is just gone. Vanished. Overnight. And it did not start until I started taking the pills. I only took 13 out of the 15 and I destroyed the other 2. Someone please tell me this is going to get better. Please tell me that ill never lose my love for my daughter. I cannot keep living like this. Seeking help... New member",0

"Some context here, I joined this subreddit about two months ago during a very deep depression that was lasting half the year. Depressed because of PTSD, Anxiety, and the obvious Major Depression.

"Hi all. I (22M) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (22) for about 5 months. We love each other, he is quite time constrained due to his work, and so we are only meeting on weekends. I have been diagnosed with depression, been going to therapy for a month and also taking ladose for two weeks. I have not become any better, I spend most of my days crying and all this hurts my relationship. I question his feelings for me a lot and I am quite insecure. He is there for me but my heart breaks because I feel like a burden and I just do not know what to do. we have discussed it a number of times, the last one I ended up crying at his chest for like an hour. I hate me. I feel that I am pushing my loved one away, even if he says he is there for me. I am kind of lost My depression and insecurities hurt my relationship",0
"I have been losing the most important ones one by one for the past year. The person who made huge progress on my trust issues knocked me down again. I want to take the car and run myself off the road while flooring it.

I have noone anymore, i just wanted to get it said, however that is going to help me I am not even trying to hold on anymore",1
"I fantasize a lot about dying, but I have gotten to the point where I am not actively trying to kill myself anymore. When I am driving, I will fantasize about wrecking and dying in the process. Or just wish I could sleep and not wake up. Maybe I accidentally hurt myself badly. I am not actively trying to die anymore, but I definitely would not care if it happened I want to just die, but I do not want it to be on purpose",1
Lately I have found myself asking myself the same question. Well.. even more than usual.Is this even worth it? And what is different now is that I even ask myself that question even when I am having a good moment. A little moment of enjoyment or happiness. Like.. is this little moment I am having here even worth all of this? Is it worth living for? Because lately it seems like its all just meaningless. Like its not worth it in the end. I cannot believe I have gotten to the point where Ill even question the good moments. I mean fuck. Why cannot I appreciate them for what they are? Why do I have to question if a good moment I am experiencing in life is worth it all? Any normal person would be happy and appreciate that moment.. Not question if its worth living for. Is this even worth it?,0
"All my life, people treats me like shit. I feel like they put all the frustrations they have on me, but why? I just cannot take it anymore. I do not even know why they do that to me. What have I done to deserve it? I feel like I am in this world to be kicked. I just cannot take it anymore. it is so hard to live with so much hate. These last few months, I am thinking about death a lot. Honestly, the reason why I am still alive is because of my parents. i have to take care of them when they get older. But I wanted so bad to die, i have such a miserable, lonely and painful life. And I am so tired all the time. I see a therapist and i take my meds, but I feel like I will never be happy. People took all my will to live. Everyone hates me for some reason, i just cannot take it anymore. I think about suicide a lot",1

"Hey everyone, you know the drill, first time poster, on mobile, english not my first language, yada yada.it is been almost 3 years since i tried to take my life, lost an awesome job, lost almost 1 year of my life just locked on my room, still working on getting to therapy (no job, no money, no therapy). I know I am fortunate i had (still have) a safety net with my wife, and family (could not make it with out them) and I am getting my life on track now, i start a new job next week, my wife and i are finally in our home, I have lost weight (i did not eat, depression really takes a toll on your body, physically and mentally) but I am looking at life different know, its a really hard journey, but i want to say to all the people that read this, you matter, you can do it, suicide its not the answer, seek help, go to therapy ( i will do not worry), life is looking good for me, and it can be good for everyone, in the prhase of one of the best shows I have seen: It gets easier, everyday it gets a little easier, but you have to do it everyday, that is the hard part, but it does get easier. Things are looking good",0
"So my wife and I just had our second child. People said having two kids is not 2x the work, it is more like 10x. And they are right. The oldest one is screaming and running around, doing everything he possibly can to harm himself, while the new one wants a boob every second of the day and waits until the oldest starts acting up before shitting all over himself and crying. I work from home full time. it is not easy.So in the midst of this utter chaos my wife says to me in a desperate tone, ""is not this the most difficult thing you have ever done?"" Immediately, without thinking, I said, ""No. Depression is the most difficult thing in my life."" And that got me thinking. Yeah, this is a difficult time. Kids, work, bills, house, family, health, my wife and I's relationship, and so on and so on... it is all tough. it is stressful and can sometimes be overwhelming.But, compared to when I was deep in depression? it is nothing. Compared to when I would have to say in my head ""left, right, left, right"" so I would keep walking, because everything inside me was pulling me down to the ground, it is fucking easy. Compared to the times when picking my clothes off the floor was literally impossible, or when I had planned out the place and method for taking my life and could focus on nothing except that, or when I would break down crying because for the 100th day in a row I was eating every single meal alone. Nothing in my somewhat normal life at this moment comes anywhere near the difficulty of dealing with depression.I will always be depressed. there is not a single day that I do not have the feeling of not wanting to live. I should probably look into medication, but for now I have it mostly under control. My wife has never dealt with what I have dealt with, so for her this new phase of our lives is the hardest thing she is ever dealt with. The realization I had after my wife asked me that question is that since getting my depression somewhat under control, NOTHING is too difficult. Nothing comes close to the pain and suffering depression has caused me. I sincerely hope all of you can escape its deadly grasp and realize how strong you are because of it. I was asked a question that opened my eyes to how far I have come.",0

"I checked myself into a hospital as I was having suicidal thoughts. I wanted help. I thought I would see a psychiatrist or mental health nurse and be able to go home soon. Where I live, it turns out they are allowed to hold you involuntarily until they do not think you are a risk to yourself anymore.Before I knew it, they took me to the unit that is completely locked up. This place was the absolute worst. Its so confined, people are screaming (some screaming about how they want to leave), the food was garbage, there were no group activities to learn how to cope and get better. It felt like I just checked into a prison. The outside area is all locked up and super small. It felt absolutely suffocating. I am pissed because I thought I would be helped on how I can cope with these thoughts, what to do, etc. Instead, the nurses just medicate the hell of you when you tell them you are anxious (because you are locked up and all you can do to pass the time is wander the halls). And you see the psychiatrist maybe once a day, sometimes every other day for literally under 15 minutes. What a goddamn joke. I will never, ever check myself into a hospital ever again. Granted it made me grateful as hell to leave and actually enjoy the outside, but I really thought I was going to lose my sanity in there. Mental health seems like such a fucking joke. I had to beg and plead with the nurses and doctors that I was fine and feeling so much better to eventually be let go. I just left a psychiatric ward and it was the worst experience of my life.",1
"they drag me along everywhere just so i can sit and watch them talk to each other, and every once in awhile will ask me the most basic questions ever like so how you feeling? so what do you think?, god people make me feel so unimportant, i hate my life and myself how did people get to the point of treating me like this? i thought i made it clear to people in my family that its HARD for me to bring myself into conversations but i guess people can never understand how hard it is. maybe they would understand more if they knew how much depression affects you and everything you do, because that is why its gotten worse for me but no one seems to take that possibility into consideration ever. and they leave me out while i hate my life wishing it could be easy for me too. and i can tell they do not want to invite me but do anyway to seem nice or something. though they act two faced and extra nice to me in public like I am a token depressed person or something. just because its hard for me and i cannot interact and i close myself off from everyone when they are talking in a group, and i do that because i cannot keep up with what they are talking about and have no knowledge about anything because I have isolated myself because of my depression for SO LONG that i cannot socialize nor look people in the eyes nor function anymore. anyway people in my family should know i have a hard time with talking and functioning now because i even cry in public but they probably call it me being attention seeking and twist it but oh well! everyone in my life just feels two faced towards me with fake niceness but will just talk down on me when they thing I am not hearing instead of addressing how i feel with ME. just tired of people having problems with people but never addressing anything everything in my life is a illusion. my family treats me like a liability and like i cannot understand anything",0

"Hi, I am 17 yo boy and i think i might have depression.I cannot enjoy almost anything, only 2 thing i enjoy are youtube videos and food. (I really have to dig for good youtube videos otherwise i do not watch them, sometimes i cannot find anything so I am getting angry and sad because i have nothing to do).I do not have motivation, i cannot push myself to do thing, i would like to learn programming and i would like to start working out. I wanted to work out for more then year now but i only get those motivation spikes - random day at random time i somehow do not mind excercising so i work out.I like to be alone, i do not enjoy being around people - i would rather be at home bored than outside having fun with my friends idk why is it this way :/. Maybe its because I am pretty shy and i view going out as something ""dangerous"" in my head, but i know it really is not dangerous but i have this feeling in me. I am also extremly shy around girls.I do not know if this is sign of depression but i get really nauseos from stress to the point when i have gag reflex but i do not actually puke.I actually need a lot of acceptance for others and i did not even realize it for a long time - i always talk in a way where i always need to be in ""good light"" (i do not look bad in eyes of others).Please tell me what do you think about this.

I think that I have felt every painful emotion way to hard and now I am just dead. I do not think there is a painful emotion that I have not felt. I have felt it all. I wish I could just be reincarnated into a fucking animal at this point maybe a shark or something. I feel like I have been stripped of everything",0

"Five years relationship and I have felt alone.I shook it away everytime as something I just felt because of my depression and previous relationships.Turns out he lied about wanting to get married and have a family.5 years of relationship.He also talks to some girl and never mentions me, like ""going to visit friends and family"", instead of ""going to my GF"".Last night I found it all out...And he said some very hurtful things...Like my autism being his issue, my ""abilities"", and also that he thought he wanted to marry me but realised he do not; 3 years ago.Yet he kept saying he would when I finally confronted him before.Now it changed because I saw a message he sent to that girl. Where he said he NEVER wants to get married, even including a ""hell no""....How I saw the message? His FB was logged on and the message history was up..I feel like absolute shit right now...I want to throw him out... he is still in my apartment visiting for yet another week supposedly, but I feel really horrible and idk what to do....It never ends...Always just gets worse...Idk why I even bother trying anymore with ""life""... He lied.",0
"there is something i need to get off of my chestTo be honest I am impressed and with all do respect, i contest that I am not depressed.I have never been impressed when writing thingsAnd possessed to inevitably suppress all the addressed that is molested my headAllowing me to feel just a little more dead.Inside, i climb To try and reach my mindThe sublime chime of a cheap rhyme ill apply and provide to my aching and breaking blind mindIn an attempt to cover up the pain.But it never works it sticks to me like my name.It feels like i can never get away.I am tired of being here. its been establishedIts crystal clear that there is an imbalance taking place right in between my ears.But it feels so much more, so much unexplored.Is it wrong to hope tomorrow ill not wake up, left to explore the whore that is death on my cold concrete floor? Unhappy, Unsatisfied. And completely dead inside.",0
My whole life has been shitty from the beginning and bad things keep happening and all I want to do right now is scream and cry and kill myself and nobody is fucking awake to talk to me and even if they were they probably would not respond usually i put effort into making these posts grammatically correct and not incoherent run on sentences but i cannot do it anymore i just really want to die I have gone through so much and I really want to die.,1
"I have always struggled with myself, never feeling like i deserved anything, but i only ever became seriously suicidal last november, and eventually attempted during march. it was scary; i remember just wanting to be given another chance. my parents had to know to take me to the hospital, and that night, a lot of terrible things were said and done to me. i eventually believed them, that it i was making it all to be much worse than it was. that they were there to help me; i even tried four different therapists. but whenever i brought my feelings to my parents; they made it about thesmselves. a therapist i had only ever made draw, the second talked more about his problems than i did, the third only ever told me i was confused, and the fourth laughed at me. but i had such a fierce need to live. i eventaully reach back out to my old friends, who would thought i died. &amp;#x200B;but, lately, I have been relapsing. the need to has always been there, but now, it is too much to bear. it is ridiculous that the thing that took me to realize it was my brother stealing my two months savings for the first birthday present i wanted to get in 4 years. but once i cried over that one thing, i began crying over others. and i realized i could not stop. all the thoughts that I have managed to suppress in order to survive are just flooding out. self harm is s tempting and so is just becoming one iwth nothing and solitude. I have thought about it, what my friends could do to help and there are only two i can talk to. one is currently on vacation with family, and the other i just got in touch with a few days agoa nd cannot bare the idea of already dumping this shit pile onto. and honestly, maybe it is better this way. i mean nothing. i am nothing. and it hurts to admit that all I have ever tried to be, all I have wanted to become is feeble and pitiful. i cannot bare it, to live in such toxic envornment where i have to go to school and be the perfect student everyone expects, where i have to wake up everyday and be the perfect daughter (which i am not, i tried to come out to my parents and they refused to listen), where i am just naive and stupid, and en extnetion for their distress. i have to listen to the troubles of adults or am threatened with being treated like a worthless rag, where my ability to contact friends is little and supervised, where i constantly have this thing wrong with me (whether it be depression, a personality disorder, or just my adhd) ignored and gaslighted into a quirkiness i want to possess. i try so hard, i really do, but what for i attone to nothing. i just want to be a kid, but all I have ever known is the need to be others validation and support. i cannot do that anymore. &amp;#x200B;i do not know what i need to hear, but please, say it, because i do not know how much longer i can go on. and this time, i fear, i might not be as cowardly enough to tell my parents. I am tired and lost",1
"Hello, I am 18 and I have reasons to believe I may be suffering from depression. I have absolutely no motivation for anything, I often feel sad and lonely especially at night. I have difficulties to sleep and to awake on the morning and I am always getting angry for nothing. Sometimes I just hate everyone for being lonely.. And I have no hope in the future, I am convinced I will fail in my studies.. there is almost no day when I do not think I would rather be dead or wish I was never born. I do not feel connected enough to anyone to talk to them..I tried to tell my friends but they did't seem to care or to took it seriously. I think the only reason I can talk here is because English is not my mother tongue so it kind of feel unreal even though I know you are real people (I would probably not say those things in French even online) and since I know you will not judge me. And I particularly cannot talk to my parents because I know they would either do not care, judge me or laugh at me..I would like to see a therapist, but I feel like or world is not worth living in so I sometimes think I should not try to get better.. I cannot tell my parents I think I am depressed",0
"I am depressed and sometimes i feel like i just want to isolate myself from everyone and just focus on myself and my dreams but i know that will not give me the same happiness as if i did it with her, i believe that a 100 years of suffering is worth a single second with true happiness and no regrets but i also believe that there is another totally opposite second that is make you truly sad and regret that you did not off yourself sooner and that is probably the second you off yourself so I am not sure if i dare to keep on living, i have seen small improvements that i have done to my live as a person but i still feel like I am still living the shit life doing stupid decisions as before and i cannot keep on living like this, I am a very stubborn person so if i cannot have my happiness then i do not want to keep on going Sad over everything",0
My depressed friend (24F) has told me that its better for us to stop talking because she thinks she is toxic and that is why she does not want to talk to anyone. Should I keep reaching out to her less often or just forget about her(24M)?,0

"i have already finished a bachelors degree in marketing and had a bit of a quarter life crisis and want to change fields completely. i figured dental hygiene was a steady field that i did not have to be an extrovert to have success at. i start prereqs in the fall. honestly i am an all around B type of student i hate math and I am not super good at tests so ik this will be a test to challenge myself. talking to the counselor she was like let us focus on a backup plan... a backup plan? this IS my backup plan. i literally think i will just take a rope tie it to the door and fucking hangmyself if i do not get in. i will have wasted my families money for nothing. i will have nothing left if i do not get in. no plan. no income. no future. i have a history of despression ,i never had a dream job or talent. i never thought i would make it to this age honestly. i always wanted to not exist. its fucking annoying that we have this ""death"" thing and having to fight that inner survival instinct of fear in the way of me finally being at peace of not being here anymore. i honestly think ill off myself if i do not get into my dental program",1
"Hi, I want to preface this by sayimg I have not been active in this community, for reasons. But I just wanted to share this today.I cleaned my room yesterday, not completely though, but enough to give me a bosst to finish it.More importantly tho, I cleaned my bed.I have not slept in ot for almost half a year and half a year in like a fourth of my bed.Well now I had my first skepp in a clean bed, all to myself. And I woke up, and I have not felt this good in a while.So bottom line is, that a good nights sleep can change a lot. Sleeping in a bed",0
"Burned myself badly. I do not need to talk to anyone. I posted it on here because I want someone to know that I am hurt. I saw a thread about how loved ones are holding people back.

"I am going to rant. What I want in life is to be loved as deeply as I think I love. And I do not know if I will ever get it, only because I am selfish and I am always going to want more. Or one day I am get it and it will be unhealthy for me. But I want to arrive at the end of my life someday and think about how much I have loved and how much I have been loved. I want people to be sad and I want people to remember me, not for what happened when I was there, but the emotional hole that I have left on their life. Like even now I fantasize about dating a girl, or making friends with a guy, and being so close to that person that when I leave, or am pushed away, they will always remember me because of whatever effect I had on them. And I want them to be sad about it. I think that is as best as I am going to be able to describe it. I feel like I am constantly holding on for dear life on a cliff and my grip is about to run out. there is just a constant strain to do anything. there is just a pull in the back of my head constantly weighing me down, so I am constantly feeling that and thinking about that, but then everything else just happens. Things have just been happening and I have just been there to experience it. Like I cleaned up most of my yard untill I got tired, then I did the kitchen, then I did the back yard. I do not think I made that much of a decision to do those things but they happened. Cutting myself too. I only recently figured out that I am doing that so that I have the scar and I can see it. And it sounds dumb saying because why else would you do it. But I just have been. I have always focused on the quality of my cuts so that way they leave a scar but. Everyday feels like a one note day, and no matter what happens, or what connection I make with people, it resets the next day and I forget. that is another foggy thing I think. Spend a very busy day at the carnival with friendsx go home and sleep, wake up and only have four real things that I can remember from that night. And I do not know if that is everyone and I should stop expecting more or not. Like everything is underwhelming and I want more. And not matter what I do nothing changes and idk. Scary :/ How do I function",0
"So yeh. Basically that. I feel like a shadow of who I was prior to the bad things that happened to me with the man I love..... I feel like a she will with a heartbeat :( every feeling and thought is something that hurts. Or I just fall into the pit of not even being able to accept that this is my life, I will lay in bed and I cannot even explain it - I detach from myself and stare into space for even a minute of peace... . Its only brief though because reality always pops into my head again, My heartbeat reminds me I am alive but its a shame really because I am not exactly living my life anymore. Just sort of surviving it . And I do not want it to be that way . I wanted so badly for this summer to be a happy one, it should have been special but yeh. I do not know anymore I think my heartbeat is the only thing that reminds me I am alive",0

"I am having yet another bad day filled with mood swings and anxiety. I am worried about a friend but I do not want to pressure her and to just give her some space to figure out her problems. But I cannot stop worrying and feeling bad about being unable to help. Or anxious about my help not being wanted. Not sure. it is hard to tell what is causing it. My brother is also pissed at me for cancelling last minute. I am going to his birthday party tomorrow and now I want to stay home. Cancel last minute again, I guess. So I am lying in bed feeling very anxious and guilty. I am trying to think of other things so I can fall asleep and, as always, the thought of suicide shows up. But this time I was too tired to fight it off and really thought about. And I felt this wave of calmness flow through me when I pretty much decided that it was my time to die. it is usually met with panic and fear but not this time. I am tired of being so unstable and I think I am done with it. It feels kind of nice. I am not sure if I am going to feel this way in the morning but I am excited to find out. it is probably a good thing that I have no easy way of ending it all. If I had a method without pain and a high success rate I would probably do it right now. I feel ready. it is not like I will be aware of the things I am going to miss. I will be dead. I will be at peace. This is odd. I feel strangely calm.",0

"Seriously. I just do not belong here. I am a 24 year old man who has been diagnosed with severe anxiety, OCD and depression, and have struggled with them my entire life. I am still a kissless virgin due to being extremely introverted and awkward, as well as having very few friends. I am a college dropout with no talents whatsoever. The few hobbies I tried getting into (writing and art) I made no progress with because I suck at them. On top of all of that I am currently jobless and stuck living with my parents. I got hooked on amphetamines (Adderall/Vyvanse) and abused them severely, further F'ing up my brain and causing me to basically go crazy. On top of that I was mixing it with a bunch of other drugs that ended f'ing me up even more and right now I am currently withdrawing off of Klonopin and amphetamines at the same damn time, as well as a bunch of other drugs I was on. I feel like I am literally going insane. Ever since the bad drug incident I am just trapped inside a horrendous delirium now. I literally cannot do anything but vegetate since my focus is so fucked from the speed and the benzo withdrawals. I am also on Prozac too throughout all of this so I know my brain is permanently damaged.The point is though I was never meant for this world. Despite growing up well I still fucked my severely in life and ended up here. I have nothing, just an empty slate. Even the art and desires I have in life will forever remain that, desires. I have never been able to achieve anything. Before the drugs I was constantly still just in my head thinking of all the things I would like to do. Now, with this situation I am in, I feel like I am officially fucked. It is okay though because it was going to happen anyway. I never had what it takes.I literally just feel like some people do not have what it takes to survive in this world and I am one of them. Survival of the fittest and all that. I was never meant to be here and I never should have been here. I never should have existed.",0
Idk if this is the place for this but I have been struggling with doctors and scheduling. My appointments keep getting pushed or moved to times I cannot attend and now they will not fill my prescription because it is been too long. They will not even let me see another dr with a more open schedule since I would need to do an exit interview with my current one. it is been over a month since I have had any meds and I will not be able to get in for another 4+ months. I have tried calling every dr and care service in my area and no one can fill that type of stuff. I am just desperate and at the end of my line. there is just too many hoops to jump through in order to get care. Struggling to get medication,0

I keep my phone on airplane mode all day so no one asks me to come and do anything. I have not reapplied for university courses because I cannot fathom how I am going to handle that if going to the grocery store gives me huge anxiety that I cannot handle so I just do not go. I literally sit in the same seat in the park for 16 hours each day with a bag of chips and a bottle of water, just waiting for the day to end. I used to be highly motivated with multiple hobbies and going through Engineering school. Now I have lost all that and even worse, I have lost myself. cannot bare responsibility anymore",0
"I am not depressed, but I have a younger brother who I feel is very depressed and not getting any help. To give you a little of his story. He is 48 years old and still lives at home with his mother and step father. Its a toxic situation. She is way too involved in his life, because he has a history of making some bad decisions. He acts like a sullen teenager always lying to her and asking her to stay out of his life. He does not make a lot of money and he is currently paying medical bills and credit card debt, but when he was not in debt he still showed no ability/real desire to move out. He has co workers he is close to and invites over to my house (I have a pool). He has asked me to NOT mention that he lives with his mother. I honestly have no idea what he tells people since this small group seem to spend time bouncing from each others homes for BBQs and hanging out. Physically he is in a lot of pain. He is morbidly obese, and has lower back, knee and ankle pain. He is going in for surgery on his ankles which will increase his medical debt. In the past no matter how hard his life was, he always had a smile and a joke. Now his humor is dark, he says things about hoping our mother would just die (she are not going nowhere for at least another 20 years I am betting). Anyway, poor health, no money, living at home. We think he needs a WIN. Something to help him get momentum and we are trying but he ignores all help. We suggested he talk to a professional and he says his insurance pays for 5 visits and then its all billed for him and he cannot afford it. We offer to pay for him, but he refuses the help. He has 4 brothers and we all struggle with things, I have a great job, but I am 50 lbs overweight, 2 other brothers struggle with weight loss and health issues that affect them. So its not like we are all doing so great that he feels he cannot connect with us, but we all have gotten our work lives sorted at this point and all have jobs that help us thrive, where he has one that only helps him get by. We are thinking of doing an intervention, but he is so defensive and private that we are not sure if it will go well or do any good. Thoughts? Does an Intervention work for Depression?",0

I have been in love with my bestfriend that I have known for 6 years and I have loved her for 5 years I want to tell her but I cannot because I feel like it will complicate things since we are neighbors and we just started to work together and since she does not know how I feel about her there are guys hitting on her and she likes one of them and I just want everything to end because the only time I feel like a living person not just some emotionless husk is when I am around her when I hangout with her when I talk to her because she makes me just feel alive and sometimes I feel like sometimes she knows how I feel and then sometimes I feel like she feels the same way I feel about her but then the next day she talks about the guy she likes and it just destroys me mentally so much that I feel like I am going back to how I was 2 years ago to how I was just a pathetic fat fuck who cannot do shit right and it hurts cuz I do not like to be in that state of being because I just cannot live like that again because it hurts so much to the point of no return I am in love with someone that I have known for 6 years,0
"I give up, I have been battling suicide and suicidal thoughts since I was ten.I used to have something that made me keep on living, my dogs, my mom, my friends; this is not the case anymore.I know this is selfish but I really do not have the mental strength anymore, I cannot find the strength in anybody, I feel like my life is a subtle form of agony (I will never compare my life to what some people go through, and I know I definitely do not have it worse, but I cannot explain it, its kind of like as if it was a continuous loop, or as if you were just chained and could not get out), I just want to be free, I have waited years for finding the light at end of the tunnel after I said no almost last minute at my first/only suicidal attempt, but I did not, I just experienced more bullying, more psychological abuse, more trauma, more hatred for myself (eating disorders and body dysmorphia), although I have taken some big steps on the last thing, and although I am starting to see myself as beautiful I still cannot talk or act normally when I see someone (whatever they are a he, a she, or a them) that its beautiful because I feel inferior to them, I am afraid of getting insulted in the streets because I am ugly, I think Ill never be loved (as in loved by a boyfriend), heck sometimes I even question my gender (I am 99% sure its not actual gender dysphoria but rather envy or just the feeling of being someone different) at times I do not feel comfortable or part of my friends group, I wish I could tell them how I feel but I cannot because I hate being vulnerable.I wish I could...you know, but I literally have NOTHING to do it (or at least to not have a painful end).Probably still going to prepare in case it happens, I am going to give my password to one of my friends so that they can continue to post content on my insta (I have not posted since February my followers deserve some damn content) I wish I could do it but I do not have anything",1

"My ex and I broke up for various reasons I do not enst to go into. We just moved across the country together and live in a small apartment together. I need to get out for my safety. The problem is, I have no one. I only have 1 family member and she is a raging alcoholic who cannot give support or help without getting something in return. I barley have any friends since I have been in a controlling, abusive relationship for almost 2 years. All my old friends have moved on and stopped hitting me up. I tried to reach out over and over and no one acknowledged it. I try to make friends and it never works. I do not even know what to do. I feel so helpless and worthless. I have lived on my phone for 2 weeks now trying to find somewhere for me and my pets to go. Nothing works out. I am drained and do not know how much longer I can take this. The only thing that is keeping me here is my 2 pets. I just want to die. I cannot go to a hospital because then I will leave my pets and I have no one to take care of them. What even are my options?

"I do not know if this is where I should post this but its going to be kind of a rant with a backstory going into why I do not want to be alive anymore. Every day I wake up feeling like shit. I feel like Ill never amount to anything and that my life is as meaningless as used toilet paper. I spent everyday for years lying to people and only caring about myself. I spent so much time only wanting to foresee my delve into greed. I used a lot of people and hurt them. I spent most of my childhood being alone. I never had many friends if any. I never had sleepovers or went to parties. I never was social and I was always seen as the weird quiet kid. I was a victim of intermediate bullying all through my school years. Whether it was because my hair or the clothes I wore, kids always found a way to make me feel weaker than them. After I graduated high school, I went down a route of manipulating people to get what I want and feel better then they were. I hate me for doing those things. I feel so alone every day. I feel like I have no purpose in life and I have no one to turn to. Everyday I just feel nothing but a wave of angry and sadness and it follows me wherever I go. No matter how much I bury myself in video games, YouTube, creative writing or music, I just feel blocked and empty. The only person that I have in my life who can understand me is my dad because he suffers from PTSD but our relationship as father and son is so broken and does not seem real. We are more like roommates than we are father and son. He only talks to me when he needs something. Growing up, he was never really there for me and I remember some nights I would go hungry because he was more interested in spending money on cigarettes than food. Ever since he got fired in 2018, he just seemed to have lost his purpose and I feel like I am more of his father than he is mine and that hurts me. I have tried to tell him this and he acts like hell get it together with himself but he never does and that breaks my heart. I have like two people I can actually call my friend but I never really get to talk to them much because they are both very busy. One of them is my girlfriend that I love dearly but my overthinking gets in the way so much. I feel like I cannot be good enough and I have really bad attachment issues so I suffer whenever she is not around. I spent 4 years of my life(2016-2020) on 2 different people that emotionally and mentally destroyed me. I am so sick and tired of being me. I am so tired of waking every fucking day knowing I am stuck like this. Being an angry, sad and depressed wreck that cannot better himself. I have tried therapy, antidepressants, trying new things and taking better care of myself but no matter what I do, I always turn around and feel like death is the better option. I am just so done with being tired of overthinking constantly and feeling like I can never achieve anything. I am tired of being overly dependent on people that are hardly ever here for me. I am tired of feeling like I cannot forgive myself for my ugly past and that I do not deserve anything but bad things. I feel like the only reason I am not dead yet is because of my shitty job at Walmart. I get so fucking close everyday to killing myself but I never find the way to put together the plan to do it. I just want it all to stop. I want to stop worrying and being scared of everything. I just want to be free from all this bullshit in my head and I feel like killing myself may just be the way out. Thank you to anyone who reads this. Death Weighs Heavily On My Mind Everyday",1
I feel suicidal I used to check in with friends but not anymore. They all used me.I do not have nothing to live for either. I do not have anyone. The one guy I like is gone and the other one used me. Lonely and Sad,1
"honestly i do not really know what i want to get out of this. its just everyone says that its good to tell someone about what you are feeling. but I am not sure how my mum will react and I am kind of scared.my suicidal thoughts come and go because i keep telling myself things will turn out okay. when bad things happen, i want to die. and then the problem gets solved and i will think that i was being overly dramatic for wanting to die. but then another problem arise and i think of dying again. it keeps happening and I am tired of being trapped in the cycle. it feels like people would not take me seriously if i tell them about this, because it seems like I am just a simple minded child who cannot handle problems and thinks that death is the escape.but i do not know how else to get out of it. its not like i want to be suicidal i just cannot control these thoughts. if my mum does not care, i would not know what to do anymore. thinking of telling my mum about my suicidal thoughts",0
"i wish i can just disappear. not even to kms because that would just be another disappointment my parents would hate to talk about. what i want is to have never existed at all. to have never been born. i have to live another 60+ years just to die anyway. i wish taking your own life was not so frowned upon. if i wanted to sleep forever,then let me. I am so fucking done with trying to meet everyone is expectations. i wish there was a way",1
"Hello! I am looking for support or just anyone who is kind enough to read through this post, and I really wanted to share about my struggles with depression and get of out this really dark place that I am in right now. I believe that I may have high-functioning depression (although I do want to diagnose myself), everything looks fine on the outside and I seem to be doing well, but I am really struggling on the inside. I feel really lonely, unloved, unappreciated, and most of all empty and hallow. I feel like an empty she will of a person, who has no sense of self and has no interests/hobbies/passions about anything in life. Everyday is the same boring monotony, and I do not feel motivated or have the energy to change my routine because I am so unhappy with the way my life has turned out and the people around me. I had a relatively good and happy childhood, however things started to get worse as I became a teenager. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school, I come from an immigrant family with very conservative values, and I never able to get the help that I needed for it. I struggled a lot in school and had poor grades, which I think caused me to spiral into a deep depression/anxiety. I have been struggling since I was 12/13 and I am now 24. I have also suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of my family members and the trauma has completely shattered my self-esteem and self-worth, which further made the depression/anxiety I was experiencing, exponentially worse. I definitely think my toxic upbringing/environment and not getting help for my ADD made things worse for my mental health. I now work at a Fortune 100 tech company, and I constantly feel unworthy and that I do not deserve this amazing opportunity. I do not have the confidence, and upbeat personality all of my coworkers seem to have. I have no support system, no friends, no relatives, except my immediate family. I am surrounded by my coworkers who are all in relationships, have a solid friend group, relatives, etc. they are surrounded by all of the love and support in the world, while I feel like I have wasted my life due to my unfortunate situation and years of trauma and depression. I feel like the people around me are so much luckier, they had it easier and I know they will go far in life and their careers. I cry every night because I am so terrified of my future, I have no friends at all and feel like no one cares about me. Dying of loneliness. :( I want to move out and live on my own but I am scared and the depression has been making it hard to find the motivation to get things done. Most importantly, I want to stay away from the toxic and negative people in my life. I do not want to feel like there is no hope in my life, no bright future for me. I do not want the people or the circumstances in my life to define me or break me down. I know I deserved better! How can someone who has no interests or hobbies and is very depressed such as myself, connect with other people and make friends? I would like to make long-term meaningful friends not just acquaintances or superficial connections. Thank you for reading my post all the way through! :) Looking for support",0
"So embarrassed to say, everything is going wrong mentally, libido has now gone down loads and yesterday I lost an erection (I am hoping it is just due to how hot it was as I was dripping in sweat and I was alone) .

"Hey, this is goodbye note. it is most likely going to be suicide; I have tried many times and thought if I succeed the I have nothing to say why and honestly IDK if people deserve to know why but hey, I am still doing it.If you know me at all or have seen any of my previous posts then you will probably know I am depressed or at least I think I am (never been diagnosed). But if you did not know I am also suicidal, I have attempted multiple time but to no avail obviously. Not quite sure when I will next try it, it could be in the next hour or in the next week. I know ""I have my whole life ahead of me"" as I have been told by everyone but honestly, I do not see the point in continuing how I am living rn with the feelings I have just for the chance that I might improve. As many of you will know I also cut myself on my hip a lot. 2 more thinks I can see I am starting to do, is counting my calories and any meal I can skip without anybody noticing I will. I am also starting to though up if I eat too much. If I have the chance to not eat for a few days I will. To my family:My twin: I know I was not the best twin brother you could have. I have always wanted to get closer but never tried and I apologise, we started very close and kind of grew apart, most likely my fault. You were always nice to me, and I understand I was probably a dick to you a lot. I am trying to be supportive to your Identity and I 100% want you to be happy and no mater I will always love you for who you are, and I know I fuck up your pronouns here and there, and I still do not do it at home because I do not know if I should. And I wish I could have the courage to go up to you and help you with what you have going on mentally, bc I can see you are not great.Brothers: I love you both, we do not talk much, but we still have fun, I miss my childhood when we all used to hangout. Being constantly called fat and an alcoholic though definitely did not help but you know.Mum and Dad: could not ask for better parents, ""You raised a really good kid. The world just Fucked me up"". I love you guys and I will really miss you; I know this is hard for you and I took the easy way out, I took all my pain and am putting it on you, and I am sorry, I really am. I just cannot take this anymore. I am filled with all this emptiness or sadness or whatever I do not know, all I know is that I have tried everything to drain it out or to replace it with happiness, but nothing works. I do not know if you will see this coming, I doubt it but maybe, after all, all you needed to do was open reddit and it will open this or look at my search history, but you always did respect my privacy.To my friends:To my twin brother from a different family: Bro I love you, luckily you still have a girlfriend by your side, so I am not leaving you with nothing. I get I am being a dick leaving you like this; I understand you will be upset for a while. I was therefore you as much as I could, we had some really fun times, and I am so glad I met you but at the same time sorry I did because now I need to leave you. I see you tried to help, I am sorry I was not good enough to be helped. I could see how much you tried, and I am so happy that you are my best friend, honestly you kept me here longer than I would have without you. You mean the world to me.That red like a ruby girl: To you I apologise the most. With your past I know hearing the news of my departure will not be good, I know you tried to help but I am sorry I was unfixable. every moment with you were great, I loved the late-night smokes and the bike rides, and I am sorry I stopped that. I loved being your friend and I am the worse one you have had because obviously I killed myself and you already struggled with that thought of suicide and I know I am not making that better. I wish I could have been a better friend, but I cannot keep going anymore, and that is not because of you, you tried to help, and I am thankful.That history nerd: I love your bro, you are such a great person and I love talking about history with you, you always try and cheer me up. We definitely did not hang enough, and I know you go though some shit, and I am sorry I cannot help with that anymore. I truly loved our voice calls at 1am. I really hope things work out for you because you deserve the world bro.That Irish girl with red hair: I am sorry I am doing this to you. The year that I got to know you was fun, always wished we hung out more. I know you told me to stop with the hole not eating thing and the cutting because of what it meant to you. I tried I really did but if you get this it obviously means I did not manage and I am sorry. You helped, sadly I am not the type of person that can get helped but thank you for trying.And finally, to the girl that means the world to me: You where the person that helped me though the worst of it. You made me the happiest person in the world for the short time we were together. We had our ups and downs, most of them were because of me, I wish I could have been better, but I was not. I wonder if we could see each other maybe things would have ended better or maybe we could have stayed but knowing be I would have just hurt you more. Honestly, I do not know what would have happened between us, who knows maybe in uni we could have met up and who knows tried again, but I mean I did fuck you up a lot so that chance of that was slim, but I guess that chance is 0 now. Or maybe that was wishful thinking, you probably want nothing to do with me ever again I would not blame you. All I can do is say thank you for being my light in the dark world, and if you still cared about me then I am sorry for leaving you like this, for never being able to meat you, for never being able to kiss you or to grow old together. All those nights staying up with you were the best. I am so happy that you can find happiness, and I looked at your post the other day and dam you looked happy, and I hope it was real. It hurt, I mean of because it does, but it sometimes also makes me smile that you are happy. I wish you the best for the future and I honestly hope you are happy, and all those plans we made you can still do but with someone better. I hope your mental health improves, and that this does not set you back at all. I am sure you will be a great sister to your new sister. IDK if this is selfish of me but I love you, always did still do now and I will still love you when I am not here. Idk if I should keep that in but thank you and goodbye &lt;3.To anyone reading this, know it is nobodys fault. I chose to do this, and I was not forced by anyone. I have a great family, great friends and great life, but I myself am so fucked up in the head I really do not see another option. Its selfish I know and please hate me if it means it is easier to forget me. Anyone thinking oh I could have done more well I know you will think it, but it is just not true. I saw many people about how I feel, and nobody has managed for me to stop feeling like this for any amount of time so do not go off blaming yourself because you could not stop this. Even if I told one of you on the day that I did it nothing would have changed, many people have told me not to do this, but nobody understands that I am not in control anymore, I need things to stop, I need everything to stop, I want to end everything and I am sorry for the people I hurt. Goodbye you wonderful world =P Ps Sorry This is my suicide note",1
I am in California. I understand this is legal but of course I am still pissed off. I am wondering how to explain this to my strict family. I am in my 20s and still living at home. Even if no fault means it was not my fault I have a feeling they will not believe me anyway. I know no one here can actually help me but I needed to just share somewhere how pissed I am.I do not think I can count this as getting laid off as they will not even tell me what the fuck happened other than it was at no fault. I just got a phone call from my manager notifying me that they decided to terminate me with no fault or because after only 3 shifts,0
I do not have anyone to talk to. I have friends but i do not want to tell them my issues. I feel like ill be a burden. I just want someone to make me feel better. Sometimes i just curl up in my blankets to feel like someone is hugging me. I am so done. I do not want to be like this anymore. I do not think i can handle this anymore. I want to disappear forever. I am tired and lonely.,0

"Yeah I guess I will explain my thoughts...you know i sometimes have thought like how everyone around me would be happier if I was dead and then I like try I think of good things or something and I do, but then like I cannot, my brain just turns everything bad, any friend I think about suddenly actually hates me, nobody actually likes me etc.Then I feel some twisted sense of happiness when I drown in my self sorrow. And then I stop. I just think ""a my brain is doing something stupid again just need to do something else and it will be fine"" so I do that, start chatting to someone on Xbox listening to loud music, anything that does not allow me to think. And then it is just alright again. Everybody feels like that sometimes right? Often read stuff like this on the internet, everyone seems to feel like this sometimes. And I feel completely alright after it happens.But then I sometimes think, but what if it is not normal? What if that is the actual you? What if your just lying to yourself? Your just pretending your happy right? you could not be actually happy when you often feel that that.And I just try not to think of that to much. So I told basically this what I just wrote to someone I know. he is pretty much the only person I could talk to stuff like this about, maybe because I do not actually know him IRL. And he said that maybe I should just talk to a professional.But like I am fine right? Just making this post already makes me feel like I am admitting like something is wrong with me. When I mostly think there is not. I feel like talking to a professional worth suggest to my brain like ""see there is something wrong with you so stop trying to hide you you really are you miserable fuck.Even tho that is not true I do not think I actually feel like that. I do not really know what I am expecting as a response, I just kind of wanted to write my thoughts down? maybe someone will have something to say I think posting this makes it worse.",1
"It feels like the world has left me behind I lost my everything in the past couple days Id be on the street if it was not for my friend letting me stay with him.

I am ready to go I am ready to embrace the peace and comfort of leaving this flesh prison and freeing myself from it all. If only I had spent more time doing things for me and not for everyone else maybe Id have a fighting chance but I am so tired and so ready to just go. I was only ever meant to be a support. I have outlived my purpose and I will serve only as a statistic and reminder to always pay attention to yourself and to make sure you are heard because nobody will speak up for you.

"Hi, I am new here and I need some help. I am suffering from depression and I am taking Efexor 400 mg. I also take quetiapine and Xanax sometimes when I have anxiety or panic attacks or the OCD intensifies. I have changed many antidepressants, but my depression is still strong, not like one year ago, but its still here and its still bothering me everyday: I cannot study anymore (this year I missed the last year of high school, and consequently also the maturity. And I passed the fourth class for the different evaluation because of the start of COVID).I think about suicide almost everyday, but I am staying here for my family and some of my friends.I could never hurt them.Personally I do not know what to do anymore.

"I have been wanting to go gliding for the longest time and now that summer has come along I took some time off work and a half day gliding experience for today.Whenever I have felt suicidal lately the only thing that would make me feel better was knowing that I would finally get to experience it.Today I woke up at 9am ecstatic, it took me 2+ hours and 50 to get to the location but I was determined to make it happen.I waited around 3 hours for my turn (I was last) and then when my turn came up the instructors said a storm cloud was coming in and it would be too risky to launch, so he discontinued it and both of my flights were cancelled.I felt so heartbroken and travelled all the way back home feeling emptier than ever. Everything I had been so hyped for just came crashing down and now I do not know how long until I can book time off to try again.The only good thing was that the guy who went before me told me that he has terminal cancer and this was one of the things on his bucket list, so I was not hesitant about letting him go before me.I just wanted to vent my feelings sorry if this is a long post, I just feel like everything has gone to shit and I do not know how to feel better about it...TL;DR: My gliding experience got cancelled last minute after 7 hours of waiting because of a storm cloud Today was supposed to be my happiest day all year, it turned out to be the worst",1

"Once I had depression 3 years ago, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because suicide was the only way to get out of the pain that I was fighting. Nowadays, things have changed. I want to live and avoid pain but I must kill myself because I found that I am the very person that meets conditions of a man whom I want to kill.There are several things that help me realize that I must kill myself, but in summary, it is because I could have been a better person in any aspectbetter job, better human relationship, more money, and a lot morebut I have not tried and I will not try. 3 years ago I compared myself to others(mostly my schoolmates who already graduated and got jobs), but now I compare myself to 'the better me' that I could have been. The counselor I met when I got depression for the first time told me to compare myself to 'the worse me' in the past rather than others; but it seems like to work in the wrong way.One major symptom is that I call myself as a third person in my brain. When I swear at myself I do not think like 'Why am I such a shitty ass' but 'Why is John Doe such a shitty ass'. Feels quite weird, when someone insults me and that guy is also me. Of course it is painful. And logically, I have no reason to stop swearing because my father told me not to harm others and I am not one in that 'others' so swearing at myself is not harming others. Not blaming my father tho, for he is the best man I know. I am just abusing his lesson.Of course I have a dream of a happy life in my own way. This is what throws me into a deeper pain because every time I dream of it I found that I will not be able to get.As I wrote in the title I do not want to die and I know that no one truly wants to die. That is why I wrote this here, to throw away the black goo which sticks onto my brain.&amp;#x200B;Btw is this well written enough to read? I rewrote this several times until I cannot make this better but still it looks rambling. Any insult will be appreciated. I do not want to kill myself, but I must and someday I will.",1

"where do i even start?well first of all my crush basically used me bc she knew she did not want a relationship but thought she should fool around with me to see if she did. then decided to tell my bestfriend that she still wanted to do that. so then my friend decided to tell me while we were out partying. that is prolly where the frustration stems but then... my dad decides to finally tell me that we are leaving for washington dc on saturday for 6 days. which ik sounds bad to be upset about but i have my reasons.... 1 i just got back from a 8 day trip for a student led organization and it was a very challenging experience for me and i just wanted to be at home for a bit bc i went with literally no one i know. 2 he did not communicate this to anyone....(my parents are divorced) my mom did not even know, and the issue is i have been at his house for most of the week and if i would have known i would have gone over to her house for more days this week (we do not have a schedule at all) 3 i am a very anxious person...i like to be able to know about my trips so i can pack...i like trips on a whim but they have to be shorter...not 6 days. and with the short notice i did not have time to plan at all. the other thing that is not going well is i have noticed my depression again. i have just lost all interest in life. i just want to lay in bed all day and feel nothing. i have even thought about cutting myself again....i just do not have anything right now everyone is just treating me like shit....and i want to cry about it but i cannot.

"HeyI think this is going to be sort of long but I need someone who does not know me personally to read my thoughts and give me advice on a few things.The first is that I think my views on society and even myself are getting changed by my friend. I am not going to get into detail as to what type of views, its not important, but I think because I have such a big need to get along with everyone and not upset anyone that I sort of just go along with whatever. The second, possibly bigger problem, is that the person I am dating, once straight and heterosexual, recently told me they are non binary. While that itself is not a problem, I am straight and I feel like its not fair to either of us to stay, but they make me feel like I have to. They always feel suicidal and I do not know what they would do if I left them. It makes me feel like a shitty person and I do not know what to do.Another problem is I am religious, I believe in God, but some of my closer friends and the person I am dating does not. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable sometimes and I do not like what the talk about sometimes. Of course, I keep my mouth shut but it makes me feel worse in the end.Yet another thing I am having problems with is figuring out who I am, Id there is any purpose of my existence in this Earth. I do not know what I want to do, I do not know what I am going to do. I just graduated high school and I am going to college. I almost feel like I do not want to, but its too late to back out now and even if I could, I would not know what to do. There is other stuff but I guess this is all I want to say right now.

I had early access to the internet so I was not unaware of real life, I have just felt like an adult from maybe age 8 since my parents always involved me in all adult dramas and problems. My mom is chronically ill and bipolar (except not manic-depressive, more like calm-rage). My dad is an emotionally dead husk. My parents have never let me go out on my own except for my internship this summer, like literally i never saw someone my own age until I was 14. They will not let me work, will not let me do anything for myself (will not even let me make my own lunch). it is fucking insane. I have tried killing myself a couple times but it did not work. But I was a little bitch and did not make a real effort, i tried to strangle myself but it did not work. I usually just try to bury myself in reading or watching something, and lately I have been reading a lot of science fiction which just makes me feel horrible. My life is so boring and I get zero independence, I am a nerd who likes things nobody else i know likes (case in point: SCP Foundation). SciFi is horrible because I will be just enjoying an SCP video and it will end and lo and behold, a fat (not morbidly but somewhat) loser sitting in his room staring into a screen, with three windows: YouTube, Google docs for my internship, and CS:GO which I will play for 15 minutes, rage to the point at which I have literally either cried or punched a wall because I suck at that too like everything else, quit CSGO for an hour, watch an SCP video, do sub-par work, play csgo, restart the Ouroboring cycle. Life is just so boring. I am going to be honest, i enjoyed watching the Ww3 scare last year, watching the capitol siege. Even when it is horrible things nobody wants it feels good just to see something interesting happen for me. But 99% of days I will read my stupid nerd shit and go look at Twitter only to see the trends filled with stupid boring shit everyone likes except me. 16 years old... Reading fiction makes it worse",1
"So...I am not the type of person that you would describe as depressed - I am going out, meeting with friends, smiling, laughing - looks like a normal life.Though, due to my social anxiety (on which I am working on with my therapist), 99% of the time I am not the person that engages any activities, I would probably sit at home instead. Sometimes I am getting some worse feelings - not strictly suicidal, but let us say staying near the cliff and asking myself ""what is going to happen if I jump"", or even sitting at home and wondering, if anybody is going to miss me if I die.It got worse last year, when I was on a one-month sick leave, with friends being overloaded at work/not in the country - we have had contact only through messenger (I do not like speaking to friends on the phone, I know they would talk to me then), and developed to the point where I realised that I could be in toxic friendship, just to not end up alone. It was last month, when I started therapy - although now I feel that I was not honest with myself during the sessions, leading to put focus on something totally different. Right now, I am at the point, where I am permanently sad, with depressive feelings for like 90% of the time - when I am talking to somebody it disappears, but it is just temporary thing - few minutes later, after we end up a convo, I am again feeling like a shit.I have tried different things - riding a bike (leading to some stronger anxiety attacks), playing a games, cooking (making me sometimes crying because of awful results), and dozen different things where I have just lost motivation.For sure I want to talk with therapist about that, but I am afraid that at the time of the session I will forget about it (as I mentioned, when I am talking to somebody this feelings are disappearing). Have anybody of you experienced that? How did you cope with that? Is it depression?",0
32 years of fight and I have not got another round in me. I give up . I throw In the towel.. I thought having my son 7 years ago would give me enough purpose but that bad seed in my brain just keeps growing. What was the point of any of this? Game over,1
"This is regarding a family member (sister-in-law)in their 30s with both physical and mental limitations on top of severe depress. They have hydrocephalus and multiple surgeries have left her with deficits both mentally and physically. She is probably cognitively equivalent to a 15 year old and has a great sense of humor and personality.Lately she has been gaining quite a bit of weight (54 and 300ish lbs) which has, in concert with her physical disabilities, made it very difficult for her to get around and she now has an even more significant risk of falling.Her mother does not purposefully enable her and is an excellent care taker but putting her on a diet is next to impossible because she is very picky and has been known to self harm if she does not get her way. Its safe to assume she has around six sodas a day. Switching to diet is not an option in her mind and The only alternative for drinks is juice and for sugar Gatorade. I am concerned she will become diabetic if she is not already. Another serious concern is that her mother will no longer be able to provide care for her if she cannot move her. Her mother is in her 60s and has her own health issues. She very regularly strained her back trying to help her daughter off the ground or couch. Even navigating the world with her daughter in a wheelchair is physically difficult for her mother.Does anyone have any tips, success stories, advice on how to approach this? I love her tremendously and I am concerned about her quality of life if we do not change the path we are on. we have considered the fact that if things do not turn around we may have to find an institution for her but she has so many medical problems that it would be difficult to arrange and it would be a total betrayal of trust.

"i live through pain. i feel like the living embodiment of pain and trauma. but something gives me this drive to overcome it. i feel like I have been through the most. the only negative thing *i have not* experienced is the loss of a parent/homelessness or severe physical/hospital pain. everything else mentally, traumatically growing up i have experienced. and i have lost family. being in pain puts my feet firmly on the ground and for some reason makes me see my reality exactly as it isonce there; it can only go up. because ultimately my mind forces my body to do any and everything to avoid thinking about the thing causing me pain its got to the point for me where i actually thrive from being in pain",0

"I understand that I am worthy of love and respect but sometimes I feel like those things are outside of my reach. I used to have friends but as I have gotten older it is harder to make and keep connections. Men always treat me like shit so clearly something is off with me. My heart is so broken that I have given up on trusting people to be there for me at all. I have some natural talents, things to be grateful for but I am starting to feel that the only thing to care about is money and pets. I cried all night because my social and emotional support are nonexistent &amp; I am ready to give up on having these things.",0
"I finally stopped talking to her. We finally ended it for good. After all the pain. After all the joy. The good memories. All of it was overcome by the bad. Id like to think it was a right person wrong time thing, but I think its selfish to believe that. I just was not meant for you. I wish you the best. Even now, as I am sure you are finding somebody else to comfort you, I wish you the best. It hurts to imagine, but I love you, and I understand. I will not text you again, I just need to write to let out the way I feel. The ache I feel everywhere thinking about what could have been, and believe me I cannot stop thinking. I know you will never see this and that is ok. I just wish you knew I loved you, and how much I miss the feeling of our souls intertwined. My biggest hope is that you can be happy in this life, and that maybe, if it was just the wrong time, we can meet in the next. Goodbye darling. My love. My everything. Finally did it.",0
my younger sister (f16) took her own life in early march of this year and I have been completely lost. she was my (f19) closest sibling and i do not know what to do without her. i have not been able to sleep more than 5 hours a night for over 2 weeks now and I am hitting an all time low. my therapist told me to reach out to an inpatient program if i think I am going to go through with it but just the thought of that makes my stomach hurt. the thought of being away from my boyfriend and my comfort place hurts and i do not really know what to do. i feel like dying would solve all my problems but now i know firsthand how it would affect everyone around me and i am struggling. I am not sure what I am doing anymore,1

"Basically, this year has been nothing but a never-ending string of disappointments. I am hoping to break the cycle with this job opportunity working at a before and after school care facility only fifteen minutes distance from where I live. When I went for an interview, I felt such positive energy from that environment flow through me. I was slated to do some unpaid work experience and needed to do fill out a criminal record check form. They sent it off...and it came back labeled ""No Sharable Clearence"". So they requested I try a different form and, as of this writing, it is been sent out while we await the results.This does not bode well. And even if this cannot help, that is it. I am killing myself. it is one thing when you are rejected but to potentially lose this opportunity because of something technical like this?""There are just some things you cannot control"". Fuck that. I bust my ass off putting myself out there. I fucking deserve at least SOMETHING to go right for once in my fucking life! If this does not, what else will? If I do not get this job, that is it. I am leaving this world for good.",1
"My ultra toxic family made me much more suicidal than I am in last 3 years. I do not know what to do. I have no balls to leave home. I live in a 3rd world country and probably I will die in streets If I leave. They ruined my childhood and satill ruining my life. I could not do something which will make my happy until this day bcz of them. 20 empty years. I am trapped inside those walls and I know nobody's going to save me. Instead of living here trapped, ending my life seems more logical for me. I have come to an end",0

And yet every single day is still a struggle. Every five minutes a little voice in my head says Kill yourself. what is the point of this elaborate balancing act if its still the same in the end? I am exhausted, I really want to be done. Fighting tooth and nail every day",0
"I have been researching NDE's (near death experiences) and suicide methods for weeks. I read dozens of accounts of NDE's to try and piece together what happens in the afterlife. From what I gathered most people who died felt at peace, but the few who ended up in dark places stuck with me and now I am afraid to kill myself but I still desperately want to die a peaceful death. I figured I would dedicate my life to making others feel good so when I *do* die I am in a nice place. But I cannot even do that right. I have spent days in bed and when I do interact with people I am giving them attitude, being moody, and ""stressing them out"". I am broke, my business failed (which was not my fault) and do not know how to function in society anymore. I have things going for me, but nothing makes me happy anymore and I do not have the same drive that I used to.Anyway I ordered my supplies only to find the gas I planned to use is diluted and likely would not kill me. Now I am annoyed and embarrassed that I have a useless tank in my closet. I know what I want...to die..but with the unknown and the pain I will because I just do not know what to do. I want to kill myself, but I am afraid of Hell",1

"What do you do when you lost you are will to live. Do you die? Do you make it quick or do you suffer? am I done suffering should I just end it quickly? I have bin contemplating how I could even do it so it would not hurt and Maybe would even be peaceful. I have slept the past 4 years away anyway. I wish I was better because seeing people cry and stress over my depression and self hate makes my heart hurt. My mom tells me that its not fair I make myself suffer she crys telling me that I do not deserve to suffer everyday. what am I supposed to say. I love my mom and my little sister and I would miss them if I was dead. And Ill never be able to hold my baby cusin anymore if I was dead. Last night he held onto me for dear life like telling go of him was the end of the world. Holding him made me feel comfortable and at peace seeing him laugh and smile makes me happy. I wish I had my own kids I could hold and love and protect. I wish I had a wife I could hold in my arms every night and know everything was going to be ok.

What the fuck does it matter doing anything when I will just die sad and alone and be forgotten like most people do. Fuck this and fuck everything. Fuck everything",1
"I know it sounds weird, not sure if its a me thing but I find myself getting into super depressed states after hanging out with friends. Recently, I started hanging out with a group of friends that I really like and enjoy the company of, but when I get home I find myself more depressed than when I did not have friends. This specific group of friends live ~80 miles away from me so maybe I get sad because I cannot see them as often as Id like? Has anyone experienced this? Depression after hanging out with friends",0

"I am 18, 19 in October, I left school at 16 thinking I would, I do not know, feel better, cope better, but everything has gone to shit. I stopped hearing from my friends, and of course coronavirus has not helped, but it was before then. Even when I was at school I never really clicked with anyone, but I live in the middle of nowhere and I cannot drive, I literally have no escape. My dad is an alcoholic and my mum works all the time, my brother is abusive and I have no one. And I am at a crossroads. One option is to carry on and someday, hopefully, make it out of here, and the other is to give up. And I am so tired and fed up that giving up is looking ever more appealing than dragging myself out of bed everyday for the same things to happen to me. I try so hard to be good enough for my family, but its never enough. When my dad starts drinking hes the worst person you will ever meet, he gets angry and argumentative and abusive, and my brother is like that without the alcohol. Mum is never around, and most of the work gets left to me, but there is always something I have not done or something I could have done better. I just think its enough, I am tired and I cannot see an end where I am still around. I am not okay",0

I really connected with that, and I honestly feel the same way.I had a really severe crush ""break-up"" two and a half years ago, and I have not found anyone since.

"First off I am not diagnosed. But I feel depressed. My ex left me on my birthday a few months ago. It was an ugly breakup and she is in my class. I am dreading going back to uni when it opens up. It hit me hard and I think I am still in denial about it. I spent an entire month working on myself, going to the gym everyday and studying hard. I aced my uni exams and was finally going to start my summer off. I went on a date with a foreign girl on my first day of summer and really liked her. She gave me COVID even though we were both fully vaccinated. Now I have to quarantine in my bedroom for two weeks. I missed a holiday that I was looking forward to all year. The girl will have left the country when I get out. I really have nothing to do right now. Just started my summer and I am focused on my part time job (work from home) and my thesis while my friends are on that holiday. I cannot find any more pleasures in my life. The only time I am happy is when I am at the gym. One hour per day. And football, but that has been closed down for a while and my club has been hit hard financially so I probably will not be re-signed. I am a guy with many interests but get bored of everything easily.

you are the rock that showed no emotions. you are the rock that is there to comfort the ones showing emotion while you remain emotionless to support them.you are the rock that shows emotions when no one else is around.you are the rock that no one understands when you just go with flow to avoid any type of confrontation. you are the rock when you are only truly happy alone with no one/nothing else to worry about. you are the rock when you know its time when everyone is there who does not understand you and you are ready to break on the spot but you will not due to fear of someone seeing you.Its hard and it only will be but you keep pushing.I will not preach and say it will get better but the only one to find out and try to is you.Kept trucking through and only think how you can benefit yourself.

Whenever something bad happens I get suicidal thoughts.I cannot explain how I feel properly.

People usually say the best way to make friends is to find others with common interests. And logically that makes sense. But I have been depressed for so long that I have long since developed anhedonia. I cannot remember the last time (or any for that matter) that I had a passion or interest in anything. Nothing is exciting. Nothing is fun. I never want to go anywhere or do anything. I am very boring because of this. I feel really stuck. I know self isolating is killing me. I know I need to make friends. But I have literally nothing to talk about. All I do is work and sleep. I do not even really watch tv or anything. How can I make friends like this?

"My life is unsalvageable. I have always been the ugly weirdo. Nobody has ever really valued me. I am either treated with contempt or ignored. I have never and will never experience the parts of life that make it worth living. I have thought about it a lot over the years, and I am certain that killing myself would actually be the smartest thing I could do at this point. The only thing that lies ahead of me now is a slow decay, getting uglier, less capable mentally and physically, and even less valuable to others and society at large. There is legit no downside to me being dead. I would not be missing out on a damn thing (because you cannot miss out if you do not exist) but as long as I am alive I will be needlessly suffering and missing out. The only problem is I am afraid to kill myself. I am afraid I will fail and end up maiming myself, but being kept alive by idiots who think they are doing something good. I am also fucking angry that my life has been nothing but a waste! you would think I would get to have one beautiful experience to make all the fucking misery worth it but nah. To conclude, life is bullshit and I cannot wait to be taken the fuck out of it. Suicide would genuinely be the smartest option for me at this point",1
"I have started seeing a counselor finally, and she is trying to help me find a way to move forward with my life. I got laid off my job at the beginning of covid, and permanently let go a few months later. I have been living off of my country's covid relief benefit (Canada), and honestly I am at a point where even the thought of getting another job or going back to school send me into an absolute panic. My counselor was asking me, if money was no object, what I would like to do with my time ... and I realized I have no idea. I have had some hobbies in the past, but I always lose interest in them. I struggle to do anything at all throughout the day, I spend my days on the couch or in bed mindlessly scrolling on my phone, and I feel like I am doing that as a distraction, whenever I try to get up to get anything done and I do not have the constant stimulation of my phone I start crying to the point of having a hard time breathing. I am always in pain because I have tmj from a sprained jaw, and bone spurs in my neck that I cannot afford to get treated. I swear I can feel my body slowly atrophying every day I cannot get off the couch, but I still cannot seem to make myself do anything. I know I cannot stay on covid benefits for much longer, so I need to figure out what I am going to do. I feel frozen in place.

"I am tired. it is the same routine everyday. over and over again.i used to be a morning person before the pandemic happened. now i feel like a zombie waking up every morning. my mom wakes me up every morning, but never with a ""good morning"". it is always ""you are never studying"" or ""wake up you lazy ass"". cannot she, for once, notice that I am consumed by dark thoughts and sadness? (i would not say I am depressed, because I am not clinically diagnosed). yesterday, after my online class, i was having an existential crisis and just lying in bed crying the fuck out into my pillow. I am pretty sure my mom heard me crying, and chose not to ask me about it. and while i like to be left alone when I am having breakdowns, it would really have helped me if my mom had comforted me. instead, she chooses to always call me lazy. I am so sick of this. online classes suck, but that is a whole another story for another post. i just feel really really suicidal right now. there is nothing left to live for. my life is not going like I would imagined it. what is going to happen? should i really keep going? when I am actually contemplating suicide, i realize i want to hold on a little bit longer. that is when i realize i do not want to die, i just want to live.

But throughout my life I have struggled with severe anxiety and depression, and every decision, big or small, completely consumes me, sometimes for weeks.

"Sorry this is long but I have to get it out.I have a dissociation disorder and I struggle with attachment/abandonment issues. A couple years ago I ended up in the youth psych ward. I got discharged and sent to this place called Woods Homes. It was a residential program for youth who have pretty bad mental health issues. Long story short, I got really attached to a couple of the staff there and sometimes they would leave without saying goodbye. That would always break me but I kept going because my favourite staff (J) was still there. When it came time for me to be discharged J informed me that she was also leaving. That broke my heart in a million pieces. me and her did have a decent goodbye but it still hurt just as bad. AnywaysLast weekend was really rough. My mind was spiralling. I was in such an intense physical, emotional, mental pain. I just wanted it to stop.My mind was just going over things that happened at woods (good and bad) over and over and over. My memories are what hurt me. The good ones hurt the most because it makes me realize I am never going to have that again. I am never going to find another J. Never going to see them again.With all this on my mind I wanted to end it. There was not a point to living without them in my life anymore. So I made a plan. I have attempted before but I have never made a plan. At least not a serious, detailed plan. Basically it was death by cop. I have a BB gun that looks exactly like a real gun with no orange tip. My plan was to go to read my confidential files from woods, go to woods, make a scene, have the cops come, Id say what I wanted to then Id point the gun and walk towards them. Bang.That never happened unfortunately. I ended up breaking down and dissociating. I was on autopilot and I ended up picking up my belt and tightening it around my neck. Even if I wanted to, I could not stop it. I was seeing spots and my vision was fading. Then I heard my cat outside my room. His meow pulled me out of my dissociation enough for me to undo the belt. It stayed around my neck for about 45 mins while I laid back and just sobbed. All of that did not change my mind though. I still wanted to bad to die. But I was too exhausted to do anything about it. After all that I smoked a huge dab and went for a walk still dissociated. I was hearing shit all around me, people walking, loud bangs and people yelling. I was seeing little shadow animals running across the road. But it was 4am and I live in a small town where the streets are absolutely dead at night. Just paranoia I guess. I ended up sitting on the sidewalk and dissociated then fell asleep. I got home around 6:15am. It was really a nightmare I was trapped in. The next day I was very physically sick. Just from the exhaustion and all the emotions I was feeling. could not do anything. I reached out to someone I work with at a life skills program and she graciously changed my appointment to monday. I went and saw her and gave her all my writing. After reading it she recommended I go to the hospital. I went to ER and waited for a day and a half before I got transferred to a short stay crisis stabilization unit. that is where I am currently. Its not helpful. I have been doing the work. I have been making an effort. But the staff do not seem to think that my problem is as big as I say it is. Everytime I have gone to the hospital and tell them what is going on the staff always look at me like really? that is it? Okay then its very frustrating. And usually leads to me making a scene on purpose so that they take me seriously. But then that leads to getting restrained and being put in high observation and getting tackled and getting a needle in your ass so you sleep for two days I have been through all this before and it was just as useless then. The problem is.. when I go home I know I am going to go right back into that state and want to carry out my plan. I feel so lost and hopeless. Not sure what to do anymore.Anyways. Thanks for reading. Dissociated and tried to end it",1

"Ever since my ex boyfriend broke up with me everything has pretty much been shitty. I have some good days but I cannot really remember the last time I was ok, I know it was definitely when I was still with my ex. We broke up a month and like 12 days ago. Nothing had been ok since. I went on vacation thinking it would maybe help and it did a bit except for the intrusive thoughts and the days where I felt like I was going to explode because of just being overwhelmed. The intuitive thoughts did not bother me too much. They were mostly like it would be fun if you jumped off that balcony which happened a lot since there were a lot of hotels the were huge. Yesterday this car was speeding by us and it was also pretty close, I had to stop myself from stepping in front of it, and I almost did step in front of the car. But the worse thing was not the intrusive thoughts, it was just me being insecure about how I looked. It made me the most depressed out of anything and it was so hard to pretend I was fine. But today is the last day and i had already told myself if the vacation did not make me feel better Id probably try to kill myself again, and its looking like I might do that. I am not sure if well be back today or tomorrow but I am either going to do it Friday or Saturday. I am just tired of trying to stay alive when I do not want to. Nothing is getting better",1
"I am tired of the way things are going.I am a 33 year old trans woman my parents split up when I was 16 my mother kicked me out the same day despite me not wanting to go she told me I am just like my father after wondering around for most of the day my dad called me and invited me to his new place (for context) my dad was a big drug dealer and I did not want to go but I did as I had no other choice.After I left home my mum started spreading false information about me to everyone who would listen and this in turn made me hated by her side of the family after 2 weeks my dad moved out to be with his new partner leaving me alone.He still used me to store his drugs and to sell them at raves for him. I was alone and in desperation i changed who I was to fit in with the people around me I started taking drugs,acting out like they would. This led to me being labeled as a mess and a druggie.After eventually seeing my relationship with my dad for what it was we fell out and because he is incapable of accepting responsibility he told people lies about me which caused the few people I was close with to stop talking to me.After a lot of years me and my mum slowly started sorting out relationship out but she in a state of depression took a overdose while I was at the home, she walked up to me and told me she had taken a overdose and if I loved her I would sit and cuddle with her.I called the ambulance and helped her into the ambulance that was the last time I saw her alive.At 26 I finally came out as transgender and lost the few friends I had made since adulthood I was still hated by anyone who knew my mum or dad.Since I came out as transgender my sister stopped talking to me and stopped me seeing her children because of ""what I might do to them"" the people around where I live went from talking to me to slowly acting horrible to me and eventually calling me names.Now I am 33 I am just tired I thought things would get easier.I have had problems with dizziness for years now and the doctors keep palming me off when before I transitioned they would always be helpful my vision is messing up I have issues with the shape of my corenas but I do not have enough money to do anything about it.I recently got back InTouch with my dad and I thought I would message his step daughter to make sure things were ok with us and that she was s ok calling me by my name and can accept that he is my dad too (she had said she could not call me by my new name and laughed at me in the past) I explained that I have always been good to her and there is no reason she should be horrible to me. I then got messages saying it was my dead mums fault and lots of other nonsense all I wanted was for his stepdaughter to call me by my name you know respect me? So I am sitting here now with no friends no family my vision playing up and feeling dizzy,not able to leave my home because of the fear I will be attacked for being trans I cannot get a move from here and the funny thing is I pass no random people can tell but because I lived here before people know and they tell anyone that will listen.I am so lost things are so hard I just do not know how to do it anymore I have tried everything and it is not helping.I have always been a good person always helped people out always there for people but I get shit on because people see me as a easy target so many people have come back into my life just to get something and then leave There is so much I have not gone in to detail on I hope this makes sense I do not know what I am posting this for I will probably just get abuse for posting I do not know I am just lost and need something or someone I just need help I do not know how anymore I just do not know how to deal with things anymore it feels like I have lost the ability to just smile and carry on",0

"Plain and simple. Recently single after an 11 year relationship. Its my own fault. I loved her more than life itself. My parents live across the country, so her family was my family. And now without her, I have no one. We bought a house together last year and it was like we were living our literal dream together. Just the two of us and our dog. Our little family. Its everything I had ever imagined having and wanting. I am crushed. I am broken. I have never wanted anything less than losing her. She was home. She was my everything. We were visiting my parents when it all happened. Her dad came and picked her up from Florida and they flew home together today. Her family was packing up all of her stuff from our house yesterday. When I get home tomorrow, I will have nothing. Sure, the house will be there. A little bit of the furniture. But nothing meaningful. she will be gone. The dog will be gone. If they forgot to pack her cousins handgun that is in the closet, I might just use that and get it over with. If not, I might buy some sleeping pills and do it more peacefully.

"Hello everyone,I have used drugs on and off throughout my teens. I am a twenty year old male that has lived a very happy and fortunate life. However, the lows that I have hit throughout have always truly haunted me. My family has a history of high-strung anxiety and off-and-on depression that has unfortunately trickled down to me, along with addiction issues (which I am lucky not to have fallen into). I have been through unconventional therapy that has really helped me as I hit rock bottom in my late teens - which is another exhausting story in of itself. I struggled with deep depression and was lost in life. I can expand on it if you would like later on.I am currently heading to my first year of college as a sophomore (since last years was entirely online). I struggle with chronic fear of public speaking and social anxiety as I had terrible experiences with my peers throughout high school, especially as I was living alone and fairly isolated. I plan on taking a second oral communication course to get over my fears since it still petrifies me. I am and have always been an extremely sensitive person and always wary of what people think of me.In short, I am looking for an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety prescription medication that is non-addictive, but at the same time will allow me to coast through life for the first weeks of my upcoming college year. I have tried Benzos but the side effects and soul-gripping addiction it causes is something I can not allow myself to fall into. Looking for a prescription medication that will allow me to basically feel emotionless and non-reactive, since as I mentioned I am an extremely sensitive person in general.I hope I am in the right subreddit.

"Mom, and everyone else,I am tired of this world. I am tired of the narcissistic, racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, Trump supporting, and ableist family that I have. If you immediately get angry at those words and think that I am characterizing you, well if the shoe fits. I am tired of being on this earth that I did not ask to be on. I am tired of being reminded that I am something that kept you from doing what you want to do. Why do you act as if I am a burden? I was not the one that asked to be here. I got here because you wanted kids and thought the child was blessed to have, food, water, shelter, clothes, and all the necessities to raise a child. A child should not be lucky to have the necessities they need to grow that should already be a given and not something to complain about to your child as they grow. You made me feel like I was unworthy of spending money on. You made me feel like I was ugly, stupid, fat, and unlovable. I am tired of being disrespected and then yelled at when I return the disrespect. I am tired of how we hide the men that have put their hands on a woman non consensually either aggressively or sexually. I have gone through an eating disorder, body dysmorphia, depression, anxiety, sexual assault, and probably more undiagnosed things. All between the span of a little over 18 years. There are so many secrets I hold that will die with me one of those being who my sexual assaulter was and some pertaining to my own individual life. Now that I have grown, I see the veil being removed. From what used to be the best people in the world because I thought they loved everyone equally. It has shattered, as I have become older now I see how if something has never impacted you, you do not care about it. All the family does is judge and talk shit behind doors. Talk shit about the kids and brothers and sisters and other family members. Do not say you did not because I have heard judgment from each one of yalls mouths. I am tired of trying to be someone you will be proud of mom because in reality I do not think you will ever be proud of me. All this family has raised is a sneaky girl that has done everything you were trying to stop me from doing. You may think that I am the problem with this world but in reality, you are. Stop projecting your insecurities onto me. Do you want to know why I stay in my room most of the day and do not want to talk to anyone it is because most of the time I will get a lecture, yelled at, questioned, or brought into an argument? If I leave this world while on bad terms with you all I do not fucking care. I hope that weighs heavily on your souls. Let me be honest here if I never met blank my freshman year I would have been gone well before now. Do you know what is the most fucked up part out of all of this is I have been wanting to kill myself ever since I was 7 years old. I really do not want to leave blank but I can not stand this family I hope that my death opens your eyes in seeing that you all are not the best parents you thought you were. After I die I hope you all educate yourselves on topics that are out of your comfort zone because my generation will prevail. It is so funny how I rather kms then live with this family. To my brother, please strive to be a better person in all please do not become like them. I am so sorry for projecting the words that mom and dad tell me onto you. I should have been better. Do not take shit from anyone and the reason why I am going to die is our parents specifically mom. I want you to resent them and use them as an example of the kind of parent that you will not be. Find a role model that respects everyone and stands up for what is right. Educate your children on topics that are sensitive to white and privileged people. Please forgive me. I want you to keep all of my medals and trophies and my letterman. To Blank my love Blank, I love you so much and I am so sorry that I was not strong enough. Please forgive me. I am sorry for making such a selfish decision. I wish that we had not met because I know that this is going to hurt you so much. I know we talk about our future together, but I just am so tired. I can not do it anymore. I hope you find someone else who is stronger than me and more beautiful. You deserve so much baby. Keep on being who you are the man that I fell in love with and who respects everyone and protected me and kept me happy. You are going to make someone happy and have a beautiful family and I hope I will be lucky enough to watch you grow happier after I am gone. I want to leave you with everything that I have you can take all of my electronics and search my room for cash its hidden somewhere.To my dad I am so sorry I know you are probably the only one that is proud of me on anything I have done good on. I hope you stop binge drinking and become healthier so that you are able to watch my brother grow. I do not know why you have the views that you have but please try to educate yourself and be better. Mom is a lost because I really do think you all would be better apart. I know you love her but all she does is talk shit about you to everyone and you are just you. I apologize if I have ever said anything to hurt you please forgive me. If anything after I die mom will probably complain about the costs of my funeral and how everything she has ever bought me was a waste because now I will not use it ever again. She would probably complain about wasting money on my college tuition because I have not finished yet. We know she has no heart she just crys during romantic movies. To my grandma and abuelita te quiero mucho. I am sorry that you will be losing one of your grandchildren so soon. Abuelita I hope you reprimand your daughter and make sure she stops being such a bitch to my brother and anyone else. I hope you all accept my cousin as she is and is not messed up anymore or ashamed of her. I am sorry abuelita but I will die questioning god. To my bestfriend and her mom. I love you all so much and I wish I was able to hang out with you more often but you have a life without me already you will survive and I will just be a memory. I love you all both so much I wish I could have said bye face to face.To my cousins I do not know how you all have not killed yourselves but that just proves you all are going to do great things and are meant to do great things. I love you all very much and hope this will be a good topic to write about in your college admissions letters. Also when I am gone you all can take everything that I have accidently taken from your house. Please keep being the strong rebellious women that you all are. you all can summon me to haunt your exes if you want btw.Finally, to my mom this apology is long overdue. I am so sorry that I have come on this earth and was not the perfect daughter that you wanted. I am sorry I have never been enough. Please stop being such a bitch to dad and my brother.

I tried therapy but its not working only moving out will. I have abt 6k right now and will probably have 1.5 k left over each month at least after living expenses after i move out. So what should I do, i have not properly hung out with anybody in a public place in 1.5 years (unless it was sneaking out when my mom went to my aunts house and that caused a boatload of anxiety bc my mom would literally kill me if she found out). I am sick of this anxiety for wanting to normal 25 year old girl things not even cllubbing just hanging out with my bf or pals in a godamn park at 3pm. Move out or save more for my situation?",0
"My life is like a downward spiral, it spins around and around and around and coils its self till it comes to a point of no return. That point is suicide. My life is on the downward spiral, the depression, the bullying, the mental and verbal abuse from my grandparents and my mom just standing there acting like everythings is all fucking fine and probably ashamed of me. My existence is a stain on the human earth. The only thing that keeps me going is my fear to accidentally mess up killing myself. My downward spiral has completed and i feel it not getting any better but worse. The pain of waking up every day and having to go through that cycle again and again and again is too much. I have screwed so many things up and I feel like there is no way else to fix them besides dying. I feel as if it would do a great deal of good to people I have hurt by existing. This feels like the only way to get out of the spiral, if I do not kill myself I feel as if I will keep burdening others around me.I am sorry for going all over the place, I am not very good at typing and I am nervous people might think I am doing it for attention. I think I am going to just get it over with.",1
Welp fuck it everything I do gets put on the back burner unless I have to go to work. Its always something else (example: one of my cousins has a game they need to go to they will get first priority over me.) I am trying to get my high school diploma threw a trade school program and that gets shot down every fucking time so I am done I am taking myself out of the program and work shitty jobs till I die. I was going for my dreams and they got shot down and burned out of existence. WHILE MY COUSINS AND SIBLINGS CAN GO FOR THEIR FUCKING DREAMS WHILE I GET LOOKED AT AS A FUCKING MISTAKE I WAS FUCKING FORCED TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TO LOOK AFTER MY MOMS FATHER AND FUCKING ABUSED BY HIM SO FUCK IT THEY CAN LAUGH ALL THEY WANT TILL THEY FIND OUT WHEN I MOVE OUT OF THE SHIT HOLE I am IN they will GET NOTHING FROM ME AT ALL. NO MONEY NOT EVEN A FUCKING LETTER UNLESS ITS TO TELL THEM TO GO FUCK THEMSELVES WITH A TREE. I am DONE WITH THIS SHIT I have not EVEN GOTTEN MY FUCKING TEMPS I WENT ONCE AND THAT WAS WHEN I WAS 18 NOW I am 22 AND STILL NOTHING SO FUCK IT I am A MISTAKE AND I will ALWAYS BE THIS WAY.

"I moved cities 3 years ago for a new beginning. Had an internship where I received free filmmaking classes. Had a job. I had a plan on how to make it and reach my goals. I got depressed then lost two jobs along the way and dropped many college classes. Now I am leaving this city to go to a university that was my second pick and I am scared that Ill forever live in this loop of things going great at first then depression ruining things. I am scared I am being naive that things could get better. I have thought about suicide so many times over these last few years. I just do not want to get my hopes up that my life will actually be worth living. I have never been in love or had a girlfriend or my first kiss. I hope I can find love because it has not gone well for me at all. I hope I can find myself again. I am majoring in English-creative writing with the goal of finding my artistic voice again and becoming a better writer. The school I am going to is low ranked due to my grades not being perfect enough to get into my dream school. Another thing depression took from me. I was once a straight A student. I am scared all Ill ever be is someone who is simply surviving. If that is the case, I might as well kill myself. I am trying to give life a chance once again, but I am scared. Life just keeps kicking me down. I just feel this undertone of depression all the time, realizing the opportunities depression took from me",0
"I read so many stories on here of people who were assaulted, abused, have no loving family and all kinds of things. I do not really have a reason to be depressed other than that humanity just sucks in general. I am pretty smart, caring and I try to be a good person (I do not agree with it because of depression, but it does seem to be true), and yet I am still depressed. Is there a reason I am depressed?",0
"My main goal is just not letting my parents to know that I am dead. I plan to fly to Brazil, burn my passport and kill myself in a remote area. In this way I guess no one could know the identity of the dead body ? And in South America, unnatural deaths take place at every moment, so should it be less likely for authorities to find out, comparing to the US or Europe ? I have been suffering from major depression for nearly 10 years and it has been nothing that I can do. I just hope that my death is going to because the least destruction to people around me. I have a detailed suicide plan. Is it feasible ?",1

"I am totally fed up of life and I am just feeling its only a matter of time until I take my own life. It just feel like no one wants to listen. On a course where I have no friends and people are just so self centred with getting ahead. I reached out to an acquaintance on the course to chat, as I was at my wits end. They are forever posting on social media about mental health awareness and how they are always here to talk. Honestly, its just all for show because they did everything to not talk to me and avoid talking about things. I am just over it and people being fake nice whilst secretly judging me for having a mental health condition. This is my dream career and I am training with total assholes. what is the point. Why do people post on social media about MH and being there for people and then when you actually need help, its just all for show.",1
"Hey guys.First of all I wan't you to know that if reading about people recovering is something that puts pressure on you or triggers you in any way better stop reading. I know that back when I was severely depressed I did not want to hear from people that got healthy again because it made me feel like a failure because I could not seem to get there. it is totally fine if you ignore my post. I am just looking for advice from people that have overcome depression to hopefully find out that I am not alone with this. I got diagnosed with severe depression back in January 2018 after already suffering for 3 months without knowing what was up. I got on meds and into therapy, went through many ups and downs and finally went back to university in June 2019. Then in January 2020 I finally felt like I was completely my old self again, stopped taking my meds and going to therapy.The pandemic hit and of course it was hard for me to be back at home with myself after I was finally back out living life after almost two years. But I still think I managed it quite well. Down days were only normal down days (once you have had depression you really get the difference between being down like a normal person and being down like a depressed one) and they passed usually within half a week or so. But now to the reason of my post: they do not seem to pass lately. it is been over a month of me not feeling good. In the sense of: I get ""sick"" a lot (not sure if you know what I mean...it is actually being physically sick but knowing that it is rooted in you not wanting to get out of bed - if that makes sense?) I do not feel like meeting my friends and often cancel, saying I have to study - even tough I do not really plan on studying anyway. I do not seem to see the fun in things I normally like and if I do it fades quickly. I also do not sleep well - it is been a long time since I slept through a night. And of course the classic: I often feel useless and sad, even though I know that I have many people in my life that love me. So I know many of these things can be symptoms of depression. I also know that many of these feelings are also common in people who are not depressed. My problem is that I know how I was when I was depressed and it is not that bad now. So I do not think I am depressed again but it still worries me. I am just scared that it will come back - actually really scared. Because (I do not think I have to tell any of you) it is hell to be depressed. Has anyone else experienced this? I know statistically it is not likely that I will have another episode. Or does anyone have any advice for me? I am sorry if my post is confusing, I just wanted to vent somewhere because it is really hard to explain any of this to people that have never been depressed and also I do not want my family and friends to worry as long as it is not that bad... I am afraid of becoming depressed again",0
"I know I need to clean my room/house, but I have zero motivation to do so. Since I do not have any motivation, I do not clean, and that stresses me out even more. Its a vicious cycle. Lately, I have not been able to sleep at night. The only time I sleep is when I pass out from exhaustion because of being awake all night. Plus, I do not get enjoyment from some of my old hobbies. I have read online that these are symptoms of depression, but I am unsure if I am depressed. I have nothing to be depressed about. I have a great family, amazing friends and a relatively easy life. Plus, I shower and brush my teeth everyday and I have heard that people with depression do not do that. Could I have depression? I do not mean to self diagnose, but I do not really feel comfortable opening up emotionally about this to people I know, so I came here. I am unsure",0
"I have tried so hard to get better, but it feels like every year of my life is just a downward spiral towards suicide.I cannot keep friends, I cannot work, I cannot go to school, I cannot do anything. I have spent the last three years in and out of therapy programs, but despite everything I have only gotten worse.Last month I was kicked out of the DBT program I was in, left alone with no support after an attempt. Now I am stuck waiting for residential treatment, but I really cannot see the point anymore. None of the therapy I have been through, DBT, CBT, or otherwise, has been able to help me cope. Nothing has been able to help me move past all the abuse I have been through, nor has anything given me a reason to love.I really just do not know what to do anymore. I have tried everything I can, there only seems to be one option left. I want to give up. I want to give up.",1
"I (16F) had a breakdown in front of my mom (51F) the other night. After that, I heard her crying in her room. Of course my heart hurt hearing her cry but at the time I was so lost in my own resentment I could not feel bad for her and I was too focused on myself, I am sorry. Now she is just carrying on with her day like nothing happened, unlike the other times where she would drive me around the city to hopefully cheer me up. Just ignoring me now. Tbh I deserve it.I know I am a fucking asshole and a shit daughter.I know I cannot count on others to pick me up when I break down like this, especially when I am the piece of shit in this scenario but I cannot help myself. Right now I feel like she is tired of my dramatic shit, hence she is ignoring me, letting me do whatever I want. she is just waiting for me to get my shit together to so I can stand on my own and actually get shit done. But I refuse to. I do not want to try anymore. I am fucking tired, so fucking tired of acting like I am strong, motivating myself all over again so I can end up exactly like this again and again and again. I do not want a better life for myself. she is better off without me, she has more loyal friends than I will ever have. I do not want to try for her or for myself because I do not want to go through that shit again. I just want everything to end. I feel like everyone is just waiting for me",1

"I grew up poor and came to realize the only thing that will make someone happy is money. it is all I give a shit about.I am trying to become a nurse so I can have a high income and if I fail then there is no point in me trying anymore.Rent is skyrocketing around America, healthcare is damn near impossible to afford and their saying us Gen Z will never retire. MONEY IS ALL THAT MATTERSAnd before anyone says ""Money will not buy you happiness"" or ""Fulfilment is what makes you happy"" you are fucking deluding yourself and you should be ashamed if you go around telling people that.When I see rappers like Lil Boosie flat out say money is the key to happiness I believe him not you!

"For the last few weeks, I have been struggling to get out of bed for a reason too even occasionally skipping breakfast. Been annoyed by others for a small reason like the way they breathe or walk to the point I lie to people who know me just to avoid being near them. I do not like getting out anymore because I now spend my time looking at people and wondering why I do not come out as normal when I do the same as them and the paranoia of them looking at me makes me want to be angered to the point of a migraine. Have been treating people I do not know with hostel words and actions because I believe I am more physically capable to hurt them or that the consequences are not enough for me to care. Have acted in blatant predatory and manipulative behavior. we are I fallow people in public from inside stores to parks to their cars I do not even know why. I had been dragged out to a party with my cousin and he told me that he had been threatened by another guy there. Said it got to the point he was scared he would be hurt and asked me to help. I then spent the next two hours going to his bothers car, Walmart to get a bat, and followed him home. I parked a block away and walked by the trees with the bat at hand. He then got out so walked after got close enough that I whistled and busted his knee and ankle and ran like hell. The only problem is that I like to much. Been so used to my mother and others telling me what to do that I struggle to get things done to the point where I keep making my personality up as I go to make myself normal since I was told by my teachers and parent. Always hated everyone else since I was a kid only having friends knowing that if I do not I would have either kind myself or someone else out of the hated I get, filling myself with distractions to avoid myself. I am starting to break and all these lies of morality, fake friendships, and saying I am ok even tho I want to bash a skull is too much to handle I am on the edge of freaking out and self hated and honestly a little scared just need suggestions.

"So I had an okay day today. But of course that did not last when does it ever? I got in a fight with my mom as usual. Every time we fight I feel a little of myself die inside. Now there is basically nothing left of me. I noticed since I have become suicidal that I think about life a lot. Like not just what I want to do, and how I want to live (that is if I do not off myself first lol) but like in a bigger sense like why are we humans here? What is the point of us existing. Basically I have become very existential. So as I think of life as a whole everything really seems empty and pointless. Like even if I lived my idea of a perfect life I think Id still feel empty inside because what is the point of anything really?I feel like this is not something you can even tell someone in real life because they will think you are suicidal. Which I am I know but when I become existential and think of mankind as a whole and all that I am not suicidal. Like its a different feeling then when I want to die because my life sucks and when I am existential I just do not want to exist on this plane of existence because like what is the point. Do you get what I am saying!?Anyway I feel like this is not something humans are supposed to think about. Like if you say you do not want to exist because what is the point people will tell you your suicidal and that is wrong to want to die. But why should not I want to not kill myself? Why if I see how meaningless and small life is and do not want to be involved in it its wrong and I am supposed to seek help. Then after I get help and get fixed and do not want to not exist anymore I am back in the endless cycle of pointless life. Like what is so wrong if wanting to opt out of this world? Anyway I hope this makes sense I am tried its late my souls broken and battered. I just really needed to vent. Just a little rambling",1

My husband then started yelling and cussing at me, screaming at me to man up and grow some balls and yelled repeatedly to me to leave him and go away and called me fucking pathetic.

Today was a good day. I got things done. I had fun. But out of nowhere I suddenly felt this feeling. Like I should kill myself.

"So on Monday (posting on Thursday) I (17F) got in a minor car wreck, which totaled my SUV. I got hit from the rear drivers side going about 55 mph. It happened really quick and early in the morning, so I barely understood what was going on. I had a lot of stuff that was illegal in my state in the back of my car. If it was not for my bf (17M) who got everything out on time, I would be sitting in prison right now. the worst thing about having a habit like mine is that I get careless with it. I smoke in my car, nobody else drove my car so why the fuck not, right? I have on/off relationship with my parents because of the kid I was before. But the most recent fuck up I tried to correct was that I ate a couple pieces of candy before my car wreck. They drug tested me immediately after I wrecked. No doctors office or anything but my therapists office at 7am. I hate to admit it but I was hurting so bad with a concussion that I let into her and cussed her that she cried a couple times. Their immediate reaction to my first bad accident was to send me back to rehab. It was on their immediate agenda. I do not even want to touch on how the last trip went. However, when i realized that is what they were doing, I started packing my bag and moving out to live with my bf. I thought it was the safest option for me to go back to school without me going back to rehab. It was just crazy how I never stopped using when I got out, I picked back up within the first week. My parents did not know and they said I changed for the better, but in reality I never really changed. I was still smoking, but getting my shit together. They just did not notice. I am starting to regret moving out. The toxic household I lived in with my narc mom before this really shaped me to love her despite her low moments. I did not realize until it was too late that moments we had were not really good. My dad (who has since been separated from my mom) agreed that my mom showed him narc behavior and that he supports me moving out. I have been fighting a whole lot more recently with my bf. Its getting harder for me to find reasons why I left. He reminds me every day but its starting to feel as if I jumped the gun. I could have spent a little longer at home. I think I jumped a little too high.",0

"I am in my late twenties now and I have been depressed for many years, maybe since childhood, I cannot reckon. I have been in relationships since school, whenever I was single I was hooking up so sex life was great.

"First off; I am not diagnosed, but I feel I might be at the start of what could be a depression. I am tired, have a hard time eating and sleeping, wake up dreading the day to come, easily overwhelmed, no concentration whatsoever. This all started when I ended up in the hospital with Viral Meningitis.But, I love my job, I love my study, I love hanging out with my friends, I practice my hobbies often, I look forward to the future. But the now feels so off. Online self tests all state I might have a depression and I should visit my doctor. But I do not want to die and I love life. Its just so overwhelming. Is this normal? Or am I just overthinking things? Can a person be depressed and not want to die?",0
"i genuinely cannot remember the last time i was actually happy and not tired. everyday i wake up exhausted. i can sleep for 8 hours and ill still be exhausted after i wake up. if i go to bed at a normal time (around 3 or 4am) ill only be able to sleep for about 3 hours and ill wake up at 7am or something similar to that. then ill try to stay up for as long as possible but feel so fucking tired! if i go to sleep earlier than that, say, 10-11pm, ill wake up at 2 or 3am and will not be able to go back to sleep. what is even worse is I am in the middle of a move, i really do not want to go because its in the middle of nowhere. i wish my dad would take custody of me or something. on the other hand, i have to watch my 21 year old brother who has autism and is also mute. my parents failed at raising all of us children, especially him. he cannot function without someone, he cannot do something as simple as sitting in the living room without sneaking into the kitchen to raid everything he can find. they never taught him how to communicate. i hate that its all on me. I am the third parent. my dad was raped before he even turned double digits and is stuck in the same mindset as he was when he was raped. my whole childhood was my mother chasing after my sister who was trafficked, on drugs all the time, even just running away from home. i wish my mom never had us stupid fucking children when she has even said herself she does not want to be a parent anymore. i felt abandon by her. before someone says anything about therapy, i have tried and tried to get a therapist and have had them before. i was doing outpatient, i think it was, they would take me out of my house to walk around, try and help my anxiety by going into stores and talking to the cashiers, stuff like that. my mom did not like that at all, she would say that they are just babying me. I have made it such a habit to not open up whatsoever, especially to my mother, and when i do TRY to open up, i feel disgusting and cringey saying how i feel. i try distancing myself from people because no matter how someone speaks to me, i always get irritated and feel like i could punch a whole through the wall. living with my mother would be an absolute fucking nightmare and I am seriously thinking about killing myself either before i have to move or when I am there. I have told her so many times how much i do not want to go and she will not let me stay with my father.

"Hello, my girlfriend (21F) has issues with depression, mild autism, a traumatic childhood, mild adhd, social anxiety, and alcoholism.I am requesting advice on how to be a good/better boyfriend for her, specifically advice related to these issues. I have read some online articles but I would like to hear some personal experiences/thoughts.She is usually high functioning but it sometimes seems like kind of a ""show"", and then she will get into a depressed state. She often wants to hide from me and the world and do some unhealthy escapism (lots of alcohol and drugs).I love her and care about her, but honestly have no idea what to do. Maybe this is a dumb question, but when she asks me to leave her alone... do I just leave her alone? (we live together). it is hard for me to just walk away from her and leave her when she is hurting.

"You see, whenever you talk about killing yourself there will be hundreds of people trying to convince you it is going to get better, life is beautiful, your mom will feel bad, do not do it. Etc etc. The useless crap, sugar coating on my already deteriorating mental health. But on this subreddit, it is not like that. I can talk about suicide freely. Nobody tries to talk me out of it, rather people relate to my pain. it is sort of satisfying to know that I am not the only one having these disturbing thoughts. And I am not the only one who thinks living is useless and dying would be much much better. So thanks to people who are just as fucked in the mind as me. May we get to die soon. I know this will sound fucked up to others but when you have nothing else to look forward to, dying sounds so freeing and peaceful. I wish that peace for people who are desperately seeking it. May we finally be happy again, even if it means we cease to exist. I like it here because nobody tries to guilt trip me or sugar coat things.",1

"Turns out I have family that work there. I am completely humiliated. I called a suicide hotline, went through the steps, was honest in answering, nobody there recognized my name and informed me family works there.

I was almost three years clean from opioid addiction. I have a good job. Good family and everything was going well. My girlfriend left me unexpectedly after over a year together. She disappeared with no explanation other then she is not ready for a relationship. I got drunk and high and ended up outside her apartment. I feel completely lost and broken. I am not sure where to go now that I have fallen back into this and want nothing more then to get high and have her back. Its hard. Life is hard. Liquor and pills,0

"For me I do not think therapy actually works for everyone, or of course I would have been better. It is very time consuming and embarrassing, do not come at me with saying embarrassing but I do not feel like I am ever going to trust anyone with what I want to say and who I am. I see therapist online blabbering about their patients and it bugs me! Three years ago my college professor told me to seek therapy, after I almost missed my final because I was too depressed to get out of bed since I was contemplating killing myself a day before that test. I arrived two hours late, my advisor let them allow me to take it.I came because my advisor called me and I felt kind of valuable lol. The professor literally said, after I reached out to ask about my grade you seem like an over-thinker, do not think and just seek therapy. I told a friend of what happened and she said then book a session. I was already in therapy at that time do not you hate when random people be like seek therapy",0
"Like, i feel so exhausted. I am barely able to hold on. I do not even have an energy to seek help (not like I have any kind of help available, but still).

"I recently experienced an episode of severe depression with psychotic features. I was wondering if anyone could share their experiences of the condition and what your recovery has been like? I was wondering are large gaps in memory normal? I remember the start of my depression which developed incredibly quickly and resulted in constant/severe agitation, from that I remember some of the psychosis including delusions, thought disorder and possibly voices and have been told I would talk to myself. Alongside this I just remember feeling really confused all the time. Fortunately I had an excellent support which kept me at home and I was started commenced on mirtazapine. If been prescribed this by my gp who are unaware of the severity of my illness, due to phone consultations I said the bare minimum to get medication. Although my memory is poor I remember the medication kind of straightening things out for me, my psychotic symptoms reduced gradually and I could remember some of the things I was thinking and gradually my mood has improved to near Normal 12 weeks from starting meds. I guess it was quite a scary experience and I am just looking for other people's experiences including their recovery. Thank you Psychotic depression.",0
"I am going into a new school for 12th grade this fall and I am terrified. Because I get bullied wherever I go. Private school, public school, international school, wherever I transfer to, it does not matter, I am always isolated labelled the loser of the school. Bc of covid i was given a break from school for a year, and after experiencing that graceful one year, I do not think I could go back to enduring the high stress and anxiety I get from having to see the faces of people who treat me like trash. I do not want to. I desperately do not want to. And the thing that scares me even more is that I do not think the bullying and ostracizing will stop even after I finish high school, because clearly the problem lies within me. But I cannot fix myself. Right now my future looks like a life of getting stepped on and used wherever I go, and that is so dreadful, I would rather just not live. But I do not even have the to courage to kill myself... how sad. I am so sick of living like this. I am sick of having no way out. I am sick of the people around me who do not give a shit about my feelings. But most of all...I am just tired of being alone. Its ridiculous, that I do not even make the effort into making other people feel better, but I expect to be cared for and loved in return for nothing. I say that I am sick of people not caring about my feelings... but I also do not care about theirs. it is crazy. it is crazy how selfish I am... I do not want to deal with myself anymore. I am terrified to go back to school",0

I have no hood skills or anything other than helping the other poor miserable fools in retail.I really just want to run away. Friends and family do not give a shit anyway. Everything is meaningless and nothing matters. Fuck this life. Every agonizing day is a shitty reminder that my life is absolutely nothing and completely worthless.",0
I use to be too tired to do anything but now I exercise and get motivated to do everything I need to do. Then after that I just sit back and kill time. I enjoy nothing. I just get motivated enough to finish everything then find myself with 10 hours on my off days just waiting for the day to end. Can anyone relate to this i know it is weird but. Like I feel absolutely dead inside but somehow found this motivation to kick ass. But after all the necessities I just wait for time to go by.... :/ maybe it is because I still actually want to see how far I can go. Or maybe a hope for the future still who knows. Like it is super black and white. White as in I am motivated to kick ass. Then black as in completely dead waiting for the day to end. Also I am eating super healthy now too idk. Motivated to do what is necessary then lean back,0

"I can feel the weight of my existence collapsing my lungs. I can feel my anxiety percolating from the pit of my stomach to the farthest reach of spine, eating my ability to breathe away.I am dying. I can feel ever little piece of my mind like my cells degenerating over time. My spirit is on fire, but not of passion but of terror &amp; torment. I try to run from myself; distract myself with projects and errands. Things that make me feel ""useful"", to make me feel like I am ""accomplishing my goals"". But the truth is I am going in circles. No matter how much I accomplish I find my self broke, in debt, in disgrace, in shame.The truth is I am stuck, and my feet are in quicksand. And when the fear shoots up, I try to resist &amp; fight it, but it pulls into it further. I am 27 years old and I am going nowhere fast. I am failing, I am failing in life. I am failing myself. I fail everyday, it is the illusion of progress.People tell you shit like ""you are learning"" or ""you are growing"", but the truth is that is the last thing I am doing. I am just coming up short, failing. Finding new ways to disappoint myself.I live a quiet life of desperation and it kills me. I try praying, scratching, clawing to get a modicum of ""air"", of life. But I come up short every time.I am not living, I am not even existing at this point, I am just suffering for the sake of suffering, and the worst part is I cannot let go of the part that is trying to give it all greater meaning. I am tired of being here, yes I might get out of this funk, but I will be back here again like I always do, and that is the problem; nothing REALLY changes.I am tired of fighting to live for a life that is kills me everyday.I would rather fadeaway then burn out. Because this fire has no grace, no dignity, and no mercy. I am staring at oblivion and I want to to fade away, because burning out is not better.",0

If I somehow survive I will not know what to do next. I have come to a certain kind if piece and acceptance There is one thing I must do before I die and that is confirm and talk with a girl who I have recently known and fucked things up with. Honestly she was the only reason I did not kill myself yet. If she has lost feelings that gives me the freedom to kill myself. I know my family will suffer and my brother. I am not gaining anything from dying, only losing what I already have. I know peace in life and death is scary but easy and inviting... whoever's reads this . do not be a spectator in your life, be the main character. Live your own life.

"For years I kept thinking my life was going to kick off, but at 29 I feel my life has hit its dead endWhen I was 14 I thought I was going to start dating and eventually I wanted to get married and start a family, but no girls were ever interested in me. I have put myself out there and I can get girls to like me just never that way. Which I settled, thinking eventually that will change. I will find my perfect match and I wanted to respect everyone has their choices even if it meant friendzoning me. well 15 years later of nos and I am losing hope and with every rejection I become a little less confident.My social skills are not much so I have slowly crawled further and further in a reclusive state.When I was 18 I had no idea what I was going to do with my life, nor was I motivated to make the most of it, but my friend convinced me into enlisting in the military. As they had a lot of benefits and opportunities.I thought hey, this will jump start my life and can motivate me to be the best person I can be. So I joined the Navy, but between the massive amount of crappy leadership, everything becoming more unfair, the shitty hours in the hot sun, I felt the military did a lot to demotivate me. I felt like all my bad habits got worse and I became an even worse person.I left the Navy because I knew with the way things would progress that line of work would get worse for me on top of just not even being good at it.I got a decent paying job, my own place, I make ends meat fine, but I also fuck up a lot. My finances range from high to low over the years and now that I reaching what is essentially the halfway point of my life I feel like I fucked myself forever.That even if I did find the perfect career path for me, I am competing with other 29 year olds that have been doing it for 10 years and I am not even good at anything.I am lonely because I have never had a girlfriend or even my first kiss for that matter and I barely have any friends outside keeping in touch with one from high school. Nor do I even know how to meet people at this age and my introverted nature certainly does not help. I have made an improvement that I have spent this year dieting and exercising, so I am making at least some improvement in my life and I have taken some pride in that. But still, I have no one to talk to about these issues because everyone in my friends and family either has their own problems or they are just not someone who I can depend on.please help Almost 29 and I am so disappointed in myself and every year I feel worse",0

"I keep on having depressive episodes, things get better for a week or so, my mind is positive and then something always happens to destroy everything and leave me wanting to die again.I know all the same stuff about life getting better and it does, then it all goes to shit again, everything good turns to shit eventually, I enjoy the highs just to go down further going back into relapse, cutting myself and wanting to die.Things are at their worst then they get better again then when you look forward to something it just crumbled before yours eyes and you have nothing again.I am tired. I know I need therapy but it is expensive, embarrassing and time consuming. Also what will they say to me? Bs happy? Look on the bright side? Write yourself a letter?I know relatively my life is luxury I am just tired of the constant short highs and long lows. Relapse",1
"I guess technically I have already known that depression sticks around for life, but it is still a bummer every time it resurfaces. I have made major steps toward improving my mental health over the past 5 years or so, and I would even say that I have experienced momentary happiness from time to time. But here I am again, struggling through each day just like I did for most of my life. I guess I cannot really complain, because now I know it is possible to feel better again, so I do not have serious suicidal thoughts anymore. The frustrating part is that it seems like no matter how many times I crawl out of this hole, I always fall back in eventually. Given that I am not even 20 years old yet, I am dreading the vast number of depressive episodes ahead of me. It never stops, does it?",0
"Ideally I want this kind of life where I am a provider of a Dutch-switzerdeutsch family living in Switzerland, whilst skiiing in Zermatt/Saas-fee/St moritz.

"i woke up one morning to hear my grandparents were going to be divorced after 25 years of a tedious and manipulative marriage. I sat there with my grandfather, torn to pieces seeing his wife leave him after so many years. He looked old, tired and absolutely void of all motivation to live. Insightful as ever being myself I sat there and thought Is this all there really is to life? Fake feelings and agony? I began to realize life had no real meaning and everything is quite literally pointless. Nobody really makes a difference because we do not even know why we are here or what the fuck we are. Birth is a burden and life is just a timer counting down until the moment you disappear and finally go to whatever the fuck comes next.i told my dad about my thoughts and he only told me what I have been told before that there is a purpose. I find this to be a lie and honestly i feel rather terribly enlightened now that i realize nothing has purpose . It may have ruined me and now I think about killing myself all the time literally everyday and life without me in it because it all means nothing but my family loves me too much. I can no longer enjoy anything I do because I know it holds no real value, Love will never be real and I am but one of 7.5 billion other fucks who just are in the same spot i am. I plan on dying in college , quickly and very effortlessly. I will leave the world and become of whatever I used to be. There is no purpose to anything and I am now fully aware. Months go by only ticking away to my death date, why wait so long when you can do it now. do not die if you do not want to. I just want to erase myself because I am not the same person i was and i have lost all value in my life. Thanks. horrific clarity, 17M",1
"for some context I am 19, work in a trade and experienced some dark shit when i was 11. no one in my household or work believes mental health is a big deal. while i have friends, only one of them is close enough to confide in, and most of them are currently on a night out i was not invited to. this is the lowest I have felt in years. I have just accidentally insulted my closest friend to the point she will not talk to me after she texted me during a slump and i snapped at her (yes, i apologised very sincerely). the guilt of upsetting her on top of the state i was already in has pushed me to tears for the first time in 2 years, and I am not sure how ill cope without being able to vent somewhere. idk if any of this is normal, and I am terrified that my mental state has deteriorated this badly recently.so thank you if you have read this, even if you do not respond. cried for the first time in 2 years",0

"Context. 22F. Recently got out of a long-term, long-distance relationship. Got horny one night and went on one of those BDSM chatting websites. Started speaking to this guy. Had a great conversation. Decided to share a throwaway insta account. Started communicating about personal life. Found out we live a couple of miles apart. Met up for a date. Did nothing physical. I told him that I do not want a relationship. Decided to be friends. He knows almost everything about my life. I clearly told him that I do not want to be in a relationship. But he still kept pushing to the point of emotional manipulation. Eventually broke it off 2 weeks off, officially (no fighting, just firmly). Now, I feel bad and guilty about meeting someone on BDSM site and disgusted with myself. I do not know why I was ever okay with meeting someone on BDSM site. Idk, I hate myself and I feel disgusted that I do not want to live anymore. How am I ever look at any one in the eye ever? How am I ever going to be in another relationship and not admit that I did something so stupid? How did I convince myself that it was a good idea? Why was I so dumb to meet him? Why should I live? Why do I deserve to live?",1

"All I want is to fall in love and have a happy life with someone. I do not want items or wealth really. A stable living, sure, but no extravagance needed. Literally all I want is for someone to love me how I want to be loved. I have been in four major relationships and they have all been SO amazing. No drug on the earth has felt so good. But I have ruined every one of them. Its like I cannot even control myself. The narcissism runs so deep I do not know what I have even done or said until I sleep and when I wake up I feel like an absolute pos. And eventually the apologies run thin and finally they leave. I do not want to be this way. But I always have been. I hate myself so much. I am 30 now and felt like this last woman was the one. she is now gone too. I am in such a deep hole. I just cry randomly throughout the day. I cannot be alone but no one wants to be with me after a year of dating usually. I think I am hopeless and really want to just blow my head off. I really want to die but I am too addicted to the highs to let go",0
You can check my post there i explained whole story. I am in very bad situation still I feel ashamed to ask for help from parents .,0
"I have had a really tough month, but it started so well it seemed. I had met a girl who I had the chance to go on a date with. This is a first for me at age 22, so naturally it was very impactful. Lately, her life has gotten busier, and I began to really feel her absence. At this same time, I had to go through putting down my family dog I have had for 12 years. This put a mental strain on me for sure, but thinking of her kept me going. Weeks later and she is still very silent. She is my co-worker, so I still try to talk to her, but I get an impression she has lost interest or wants to avoid me. I wonder if my impressions are large assumptions, but with the grief and anxiety I have felt lately, I take them as reasonable possibilities. All this has cascaded into some of the worst depressive feelings I have had in a long time. I struggled with it through my teens, but after being prescribed zoloft I saw improvement over time. What makes this hard is how uncertain I feel about myself. I think I put so much thought into her as my first, I was not prepared for becoming attached and the emotional impact of not feeling liked. Now I go to work actually scared to see her, since even if she will not decide to reject me or give closure, I dread the negative image I give of myself in my current depressed state. I am having a hard time seeing the other side of this, and while I think I am safe from thoughts of self harm, I feel I have lost a lot of joy and motivation to keep being myself. Depression created from attachment has trapped me",0

I have spoke to a lot of people and no one has managed to help before-not their fault its just that no one can help me its literally always me in my head alone speaking to myself no one else there and there will never be anyone else I am so alone but surrounded by people and I cannot do anything I am sick of living this fucking shit I have reason but I am blinded by everything else I am sure ppl will read this and laugh at how stupid I am maybe my grammar is incorrect i do not even fuck this why am I even doing this shit man.

"I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid, before I moved for the first time, friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in, we moved again. and again, I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever, they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left, my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular, just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again, they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time, a good job, and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after, a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job, I moved back to my ""hometown"" to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids, husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move, I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country, back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends, no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this, know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish, I would ask to have never been born. obviously, there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now. Rant. Down in my feels tonight. it is a long one.",0
I have extreme anxiety to the point where getting up in the morning is difficult and going outside makes my heart feel as if it is going to escape my chest.

"(This is basically just a huge ramble so uhh I am sorry in advance) I am not really sure if this is the right place for this, it is more of just a general mental health thing, but I think it is probably caused by depression? I am not really sure. But, basically, I used to be able to think deeply and clearly, and I used to just think more intelligently than I do now. I can just tell it in the way that I even respond to people now, that I am not as intelligent as I used to be, or at least, my depression blocks me from thinking clearly. I was never super smart, but I used to be able to at least think in more complex ways. But now, my brain just feels so blurry, and all I can think about is how useless I am in comparison to everyone else around me. The world just does not feel quite as real, either. I know that everything around me is real, but I just do not feel as connected to it before as I used to.

"1) In 2011 my best friend passed away in a bike accident at that time my age was around 15.That incident really affected my mental health badly and now still after 10 years i am really depressed about that thing.2) I wanted to become a Professional Football Player but tbh i never gave my 100% and after my friends death i started to stay at home and made my house comfort zone.Lost contact with all my friends and with the girl i loved(My First Love)3) Talking about my First Love i first saw her in 2005 and i had little bit of family drama with her family also where her parents came to know about the thing i liked/loved there daughter.Her Mother was nice and just because i was a kid my age was probably 11-12 she said this is not the age to do love and these kind of things there is proper age for these kind of things.I apologized to my crush on fb and she did forgive me.After almost 1-2 years we became friends but there was a problem my one frnd was now her bf and they both were in a relationship.At that time i accepted the fact that with my crush the only relationship i am going to have is of friendship and nothing else.But somewhere deep inside i felt when we became friends and got to know each other personally she liked me but was waiting for me to make a move.4) In April 2021 while having a chat with my friend i get to know my First Love/Crush got pregnant and had done abortion recently.That news really fucked my mind up,i feel really bad for her bcoz her behaviour towards me was very nice she did forgive me and when i made the move for friendship she accepted me without any hesitation.5) I have health issues(Asthma and Diabetes) and my doctor has recommended to start exercising.Having Asthma was one of the reason why i gave up on my dream of becoming Professional Football Player.6) I have been having suicidal thoughts from past 2 years but now i feel universe is trying to help me in achieving my goals and trying to help me in my love life by giving news of First Love being Pregnant and Abortion.Doctor advising to start exercising i can take these things as positives and work on building and achieving my dream of being Professional Football Player i know it is bit late in terms of age for starting a career in sports but i want to give atleast one try for the things which i loved and that is Football and my First Love.I do not want die having regrets.7) there is a huge 10 year communication gap between me and my First Love because after 2011 after my best friend's death i made my home comfort zone.I have cried after hearing the news of her Pregnancy and Abortion i just want to talk with her and see her.I am not in a hurry of becoming her bf first i want heal/help her mental health/career wise.I want to marry her.But because we have huge communication gap i fear does she remember me.8) I have planned few things to make her remember times of us being friends and tell her my love feelings through it (Like for eg:- About the day when i saw her for the very first time) editing pictures(Written in story format and cartoon) and video edit (Stop Motion Video).But first i am going to try and build a bond with her like we had 10 years ago and i have plans to help her by giving her tips for growing her business and then i am going to express my love feelings towards her tbh from last 15 years she knows that i love her it is just i have never confessed my love to her face to face.( Please do not tag me as a creepy guy i have written everything what i really feel) ( Big Sorry for my Bad English i tried my best any Advice would be welcomed ) Life is trying to give me a second chance should i try my luck ?",1

Been going to a doctor for 2 years now and the pills helped but only to point where I actively do not plan my suicide of am hour every day. I tried claim for disability benefits since I basically have panic attacks and self harm when too stressed and break down for few hours after doing anything outside among people (try to help home by shopping sometimes) but was told my productivity was lowered only by 10% and you need 30% to be accepted disability of first level.

"First, some background, I am 38/M and have been living with mom for the past six years. I moved back in with her because I was in a bad financial and emotional state. Lost my job was basically broke. After going through another couple jobs, I finally found stability in a job that I have had for the past few years. Now, I am thinking about moving out as it is time do that and my mom's going to retire soon.Still there is some uncertainty about what I want to do next. I am not in not sure how much I want to stay with the career I have been able to save up a fair amount of money because of my situation so I have some options I guess. I know that I have to make my own way in this world in spite of the issues I have but I am not sure what to do next.I do not really have much to keep me where I am now which is pretty much where I have lived all my life. I do not have any real friends, except for some that I message every once in a blue moon on FB. I have lived on my own before so I know I can do it but I wonder if getting a fresh start in a place far from where I am now is a good idea.Not sure if I should go somewhere where I am close to family or if I should not let that be something that is really important part of where I decide to go next. I know my depression is not as bad as some people's but it is something I still deal with on daily basis and the loneliness of not having friends is probably the worst part of it. I am hoping that getting away from this place that has so much personal negative history to it will help but I am not sure. Have any you been in a similar situation? Did moving help? Did you try to stay close to your family? Thanks in advance. Thinking about moving and getting a fresh start",0

"[IWTL how to lose weight]( yesterday, I posted this on the IWTL sub, and today I took the peoples advice from the sub and started my weight loss journey. I did some exercises for today and after I was done, I sat down with a healthy breakfast. As soon as I sat in front of the tv to eat, my mom taunted me, So you started exercising today? I said, Yeah. She suddenly told all my family that I(me) was not going to eat any butter or pasta or any junk food. I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister (18) chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen. This is a pattern now, every time I try to improve they react very very negatively, I feel like shit at my house. I do not know what to do. I started my self improvement and weight loss journey today and my family absolutely brought me down.",0

"This has been the worst fucking year of my life. Fucking 34 years on this planet and nothing takes the fucking cake like this. No friends to vent to, anxiety rushing through my head, ocd replaying the same fucking convos repeatedly. I cannot deal with all of this heartache. I lose my two year relationship. My family splits apart. Me and my girls rebuild. Meets another girl she breaks our heart. And yoyos it back and forth for months as we wait first one comes back and we give her a chance. She leaves us again. Second girl comes back and continues toying with being committed. I lose my shit and had enough of the games and leaves. Meet another woman she seems great but taken. Refuses to leave her dead end relationship for us and prefers to cheat. that is not for us. Meet another woman like her alot but we agree it would not work. Person we dated before wants to hang out nothing serious (yay...). Met an amazing woman but she is not sure if she wants to be with us. Second girl comes back again. And says sorry. Then tonight confesses the guy friend I warned her about and she was foul for taking his number in the first place when she never took others which itself is a red flag, well they while she is been gone for this month have been dating and making out etc. But yet confesses her love and wants to be with us. Says it is not a big deal but refuses to lose him. Yet says it is just fun while she is on her journey until she is ready to settle. I am not ok with that. Fuck that shit.My mother is possibly dying too.My girls are sick and struggling to support me emotionally. They are pretty much numb to all of this. They hide their feelings well. But I can tell their hurt also. Our son is sick.I am back to self harm.I am getting addicted to weed again as I self medicate daily to try and keep functioning.I am bursting at the seams and want to fucking die. I promised myself I would not get back to a suicidal place but yup I am here. Daddy's home. I swear I am going to fucking do it. I am so much over all of this pain and heartache. All of this grief and strife. I am done with it. I want to fucking jump in the river and drown. I cannot keep going another day like this. No friends to talk to, no family to talk to, and the girls cannot emotionally be there as they are not those types of individuals to know how to adequately be there for someone with my level of depression. Yay..I swear this is going to finally be it. I swear to fucking god imma do it.",1
"The Earth is fucked. Climate change is just going to get worse and at this point I cannot do anything about it. The corporations and billionaires are just going to keep exploiting and raping the world of all of its treasures and natural beauties. I do not want to live in a world that is on its death bed. what is the point of going to college right now when I am not going to get a good job anyways. I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life, never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school, and now that I am, all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment, I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. Everything is fucked",0

"Its been a really tough couple weeks. I am stuck at my parents for the summer. 2 weeks ago I went out to see my friends in person for the first time since the pandemic, and that was great, but they only had a little bit of time for me because they were all hanging out with their girlfriends and the other stuff we need to do with our lives. Since coming back to my parents I have just felt so isolated and more alone than ever. I do not know anyone here my age and there is no real way for me to meet people. The only thing open like that is bars rn and I have anxiety problems and I am also embarrassed about being stuck at my parents.Idk. I just feel so isolated. This new more acute loneliness is really hitting me hard on top of the usual fear that Ill be alone forever romantically since I am 22 year old guy and never dated despite my best attempts. If anyone wants to talk, that would be really nice. Feeling incredibly lonely recently",0
"I lightly slapped my ex girlfriend in the shower two weeks ago because she made a joke about having sex with someone very close to my heart that passed away. It was a knee jerk reaction Wed explored slapping and other things like that in the bedroom. She is calling me an abuser and that my future looks bleak. I have done so much work to be a better person over the years. I put a gun in my mouth the other night. I am glad I do not have anything stronger than a .22 I do not want to be a vegetable. its odd because In a way I am so peaceful but I feel like if I am such a horrible person then maybe I should not be alive. People were saying she should destroy my life. I want to feel good again. I actually am feeling good again. But there is something that says maybe it would be better to end it. I am getting help I want to meet someone I love. I really want to love myself. I feel so close but I am neck and neck with ending it all. This is not the first time I have been here. I never thought Id be here again. But. I hurt her. I feel like I never even really knew her and I lost myself in her. I was already having some of these feelings come up when I was with her.

"I cannot really think of any reasons to stay alive anymore. Not necessarily in a depressing way , I feel really numb. I just think this world is basically hell, the majority of people are suffering and barely anyone ever wants to help other people. Literally the only thing that stops me from leaving this place is not wanting to make my family ""suffer"" with losing me. But to be fair I have always been an outcast in my family anyway they must be used to disappointment. I feel like before I do, I have to convince them to not care or accept that it is truly what I want and that I think it is better for me not to exist here. But bringing it up is the hard part because obviously it would be hard for them to accept or process. Also, failing and being in prolonged pain or ending up with some sort of brain damage / in some vegetable state is quite worrying. I do not care about fitting into society nor making money anymore, the only thing I want to do is help other people and make their life better but how can I do that when I isolate and cannot even take care of myself. Dying and experiencing nothing, or concious living on outside the body sounds alot better than this. Suicide is like a fantasy to me",1
"I have struggled for over 10 years, since early teenage years. Many periods of suicidal ideation. Sure I have times where it feels okay or manageable for some time. But better never stays. It scares me so much to know it will come back no matter what I try. I never thought Id live this long to begin with. People are moving on without me, society is moving on without me. How is it possible to feel so empty but so heartbroken and distraught at the same time? Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem just does not feel right to me. It never goes away. Does better ever stay forever?",1
"There are genes for aggression, tribalism and greed. Three things that have plauged our entire species from our ape-like days. Babies are inherently racist. They trust people like look like them and usually show signs of discomfort and nervousness around people of other races a study reported. We are literally bad from birth. The only way to make a better society is to genetically remove those genes out of the gene pool which is possible. Scientists have done it before in other animals but nobody would agree to have it being done to humans because of ethical reasons so therefore look forward to racism, sexism, homophobia, capitalism, war, violence, rape, greed and more NEVER ending. Only way it will end is if we go extinct. Depression should not be considered a mental illness. It is the natural reaction to waking up to how evilness in literally wired into the genetics of humanity.",0

"So, something amazing happened yesterday! A job opportunity basically just sprang up into my face. I completed two back to back phone interviews with the owner and manager, then boy the next thing i know we are talking about start dates and pay and...I am terrified? I should be thrilled. How lucky am I that this happened? I should be jumping for joy because I desperately need a job, have not worked in a year due to covid, and this could be a great fit for me. But all i keep coming back to is how much I want to die. How anxious at failing i am. How depressed i am. How incapable I am. How I have walked this road before; gotten a cool job, dealt with the stress for a few days, and then broke under the weight of constant suicidal ideation. Its a pattern I, and the others in my life recognize. To the point that everyone I tell when getting the news mentions that ""oh well I am sure you can handle it this time"" This time...But I am so afraid. I am so depressed. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. But i know i need this job. Please. Help... Self sabotage, please help",1

"it is not that I never feel any excitement or emotions. I can get excited about a new game, tear up for a sad movie, laugh at a joke, and even smile when something good is happening. it is just, these feelings, these emotions, they come as suddenly as they disappear. Because these feelings fade away so quickly, I often find myself seeking out new material to stimulate my emotions, be it a good book, a new game, or a sad movie. But it really sucks, because even when I am doing this, I easily lose interest, and end up having to start something new way before I even come close to finishing what I just started. Yet despite this, I cannot stop, because if I do not do this, I feel like I am simply just breathing and not actually living. I am always overwhelmed by boredom and fatigue, but even more than that, I just feel so very empty all the time. Its as if there is a large gaping hole at the bottom of my heart, no matter how much I fill it up, everything just falls right out and once again, it is empty again.
